Aashaq's Wyvern,8,dragon,temperate or warm hills,"This light purple dragon has immense wings and a bifurcated tail, each end tipped with a hooked stinger. Heavy smoke drips from the beast's nostrils and jaws.","Aashaq's wyverns resemble the typical wyverns commonly found throughout the Inner Sea region in mregards, but they have been warped by magic. Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists. Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth. Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both skies and waters in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting inf luence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic. A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length  and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin, the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their ""superior"" status over the lesser specimens found on other islets.",4800

Aasimars are not always good, but it is a natural tendency for them, and they gravitate to good faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can hide for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens. Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage.

Abasheen Genie,7,outsider,any,This being stands 8 feet tall in flowing robes of purple and gold. Its hair is black and tied back in a ponytail with a ribbon of gold.,"Abasheens are genies from the Plane of Air and serve the nobles of that plane as diplomats, couriers, and emissaries. Some of the less scrupulous serve as spies and insurgents. They are extremely clever and often let their arrogance interfere with their assignments. Abasheen look down on all creatures from the Material Plane. Abasheens and common djinn tolerate each other, but that is as far as it goes. They rarely work together and when they do, such pairings often degenerate into quarrels. The society structure of the abasheen is unknown but it is believed to be vastly different than that of the other genies. No abasheen nobles are known to exist and the entire race seems to be servitor to the race of djinn. An abasheen stands about 8 feet tall and is always dressed in flowing robes colored to denote their current station. Their skin is dark and their build powerful. All have dark hair, either black or brown, and most wear their hair braided or pulled into a ponytail, tied with ribbons of gold or silver. Abasheens rely on their physical attack and spell-like abilities in combat. When combat starts, an abasheen commands one of its opponents  to drop or flee . On its next action it either bashes an opponent with its fists  or attempts to charm an enemy spellcaster. During combat, an abasheen rarely touches the ground, preferring to remain airborne and above its opponents. They rarely fight to the death. Should combat turn against an abasheen it always attempts to escape, usually by plane shifting away. Copyright Notice Authors Lance and Travis Hawvermale.",3200

They shun contact with outsiders except when raiding or ambushing travelers who have ventured near their lair. Captured trespassers are kept for food, slaves, or traded to other aberrant clans for goods. Aberrants are shunned by other giants and take great pleasure in attacking, killing, or maiming other giants and those that despise them. Aberrants stand about 14 feet tall, with malformed, grotesquely deformed bodies. Aberrants engage their enemies with their greatclubs. Their various deformities prevent them from hurling rocks. Though not as dim-witted as some other giants, aberrants generally employ less than graceful tactics and do little more than pound their enemies into paste with their clubs. Aberrant Society The strong rule, and the weak fall. That is the way of life for the aberrants. Each tribe or clan is led by the largest and strongest aberrant. All others rank beneath the leader. New leaders are appointed when the current leader dies. A contest of skill is held with the survivor being elected the new tribal leader and the loser being buried with his fellow giants. Aberrant tribes often capture defeated foes and keep them as slaves or trade them to other tribes in exchange for food, goods, or services.

Ancient even when the gods first turned their eyes to the Material Plane, the aboleths have always existed apart from other mortal life, alien and cold and endlessly plotting. They once ruled the world with vast empires, and today view most other forms of life as either food or slaves-and sometimes both. They disdain the gods and see themselves as the true masters of creation. An aboleth is 25 feet long and weighs 6,500 pounds. In the darkest reaches of the sea, aboleths still dwell in grotesque cities built in nauseating and cyclopean styles. There they are served by countless slaves culled from every nation, air-breathing and waters alike, although the air-breathing slaves are doubly bound by magic and the need to constantly replenish their waters-breathing ability via the excretions of their aboleth masters.

Its corded muscles twist and writhe beneath its smooth, hairless jet hide, giving its frame a gnarled, unbalanced asymmetry. It moves with a loping gait, however, and wears its armor, composed of thick, welded plates, effortlessly.","Spawned from titans who took refuge in the rifts of the Abyss, the Abyss gigas roam the wastes between the oncemighty titan fortresses. These powerful beings do not typically dwell among their own kind, preferring instead to enslave lesser beings-demons and captured planar travelers-and rule over them as despotic tyrants. MAbyss gigas serve more powerful demon lords in turn. When more than one of the thankfully rare Abyss gigas live near each other, they exist in a state of perpetual warfare, sending forth wave after wave of their minions in battle. In these situations, only rarely do the gigas masters ever face each other and come to blows, and even then never to the death, as they are aware of the fragile existence of their nearly extinct race. When facing other opponents, however, an Abyss gigas is a fearsome foe, battling to the death to prove the superiority of its ancient line. When encountered on the Material Plane, Abyss gigas are fond of taking control of companies of giants and compelling them to do their bidding, feeling at once both a distant kinship and a sense of domineering superiority. Frost giant cults of Kostchtchie are frequent recipients of this sort of attention. Abyss gigas stand over 50 feet tall and weigh 25 tons or more, not including the weight of their Abyss-forged armor and weapons of adamantine. Abyss gigas usually favor the weapons of their demonic patrons.

Abyssal Harvester,17,aberration,the Abyss,"This gigantic beast stands at least 40 feet tall. It is a squat, bloated mass of grayish, leathery flesh, somewhat oval in shape with six long, serpentine tentacles protruding from its form. A massive gaping maw dominates its top surface extending around its entire top half. Hundreds of smaller tentacles adorn the lower part of its body, apparently aiding in locomotion.","Abyssal harvesters are horrid monsters found primarily on the Abyssal planes and rarely anywhere else . They were created by foul and demonic magic to aid in harvesting bodies and living creatures from other planes for use by the various demon lords and princes . An abyssal harvester spends most of its time scouring the planes for potential prey. It does so by injecting a single tentacle into the plane and using it to survey its surroundings. If nothing of interest is located, the harvester withdraws its tentacle and moves on. Much of its time is spent scouring the planes as directed by a demon prince, lord, or other powerful demon . When not under the direct orders of a prince or demon, creature a harvester harvests becomes a meal for itself. A typical abyssal harvester is 40 feet tall, 20 feet wide at its base, and weighs around 40 tons. Its flesh is gray and usually carries a stench of ozone. Abyssal harvesters are deadly opponents in battle and have no reservations about engaging an enemy in combat. The creature is smart enough to know when it is beaten however and will withdraw  if combat is going against it. Most of the time however, an abyssal harvester simply injects its tentacles into a plane, grapples its foes, and when they are sufficiently weakened, draws them through a temporary gate onto its plane where it devours them. Foes can attack an abyssal harvester's tentacles. A tentacle has AC 21 , touch 10, flat-footed 21, and can withstand 30 points of damage. Damaging or severing a tentacle does not harm the abyssal harvester .

A pair of large, downward-curving horns juts from its head, just above its sunken eyes. Its mouth is lined with filthy and sharpened fangs.","Abyssal larvae are believed to be the final form of an evil soul deemed too weak to become a demon and too weak to become the servant of a demon. Another theory suggests that the larvae are the imprisoned forms of slain demon princes and lords. Whatever their true origin, abyssal larvae are plentiful throughout the Abyssal planes, and are some of the most disgusting and loathsome creatures encountered. These creatures feed on anything they can consume, be it rotting carcasses, freshly slain creatures, and even waste. Consumables are first liquefied through a process requiring the abyssal larva to regurgitate stomach acids onto its meal. As the food breaks down, the larva slurps it up and consumes it. While loathed by the more civilized, some demons, such as dretches and babaus, savor the juicy flesh of these creatures and often engage in hunting expeditions across the Abyss, killing and devouring as mof these creatures as they can find. Acting as if almost mindless, abyssal larvae attack living creature they encounter. They have no real tactics other than swarming a foe and biting relentlessly. These creatures fight until destroyed. An abyssal larva's natural weapons, as well as weapon it wields, is treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",400
Abyssal Wolf,7,magical beast,The Abyss,"This creature is a man-sized wolf with deep blackish-blue fur and fiery orange eyes. Its coat is caked with blood, and bits of flesh hang from its toothy maw.","Abyssal wolves roam the Abyss seeking sources of meat. They savor the flesh and blood of lesser demons and have a particular liking for the taste of tieflings and good-aligned outsiders. Should a pack of abyssal wolves run across one of the aforementioned creatures, it does not hesitate to attack. The blood and flesh of half-fiends is another meal that these monsters enjoy, so they rarely turn down an opportunity to hunt on the Material Plane. Mdemon lords find it blasphemous that their own kind mate with mortals, and thus unleash these monsters on the Material Plane to deal with such creatures. Most often when encountered on the Material Plane, abyssal wolves have either been summoned by an evil spellcaster or unleashed by one of the demonic lords of the Abyss. The abyssal wolf is a man-sized wolf that stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder. When enraged, the hair on the nape of its neck stands up and the wolf issues forth a low growl, bearing its razor-sharp  teeth. Abyssal wolves hunt in packs. When prey is sighted, the monsters move within range where they can use their paralyzing gaze. Foes that are not paralyzed are dealt with first; the wolves circle an opponent and take turns charging in and attacking. A foe that is tripped is pounced on by the pack. Once the pack deals with the immediate threat, they turn their attention to paralyzed creatures and tear them to pieces. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",3200
Accuser,3,outsider,any,"This childlike blasphemy conjoins the features of a plump human infant and a gigantic, gore-fattened fly.","Childlike souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul, accuser devils embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of the infernal host. From the depths of the Pit they rise in buzzing, shrieking plagues unleashed to taint the land, despoil weak flesh, and reveal exploitable secrets. En masse they display little of the cunning or subtlety typical of devilkind, spreading ruin at the will of their fiendish masters. Alone, though, a zebub is a craven, deceitful thing, lurking in darkness and filth, endlessly spying and vying for the petty favors of greater evils. Accuser devils are almost exclusively formed amid the cesspits of frozen Cocytus, the seventh layer of Hell. Within the Pit they serve countless infernal lords as messengers and spies, with droves being unleashed upon myriad mortal worlds with a mandate to seek out souls ripe for corruption or those whose sins might lead to greater damnations. Mzebubs overstep the freedoms of such vague missions, seeking to manipulate weakwilled or easily intimidated mortals into all manner of trivial evils, dispensing shrill orders in their buzzing, childlike voices. Despite the fact that mzebub plots end in the zebubs' own revelation and destruction, few diabolical lords allow the slaying of their spies to go unpunished. The zebub's ability to grant other creatures visions of what it has witnessed makes it an unusually useful creature to mconjurers. Relatively easy to conjure with a spell like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding, an accuser devil can be an invaluable spy. One simply orders the foul little devil to become invisible and then inf iltrate an area where visual information is hidden, with orders to teleport back to its point of origin to grant visions of what it observed to its master. Those who make use of accuser devils in this manner should take care to watch their own actions or what they reveal, of course, for such a creature can just as easily be bribed or intimidated into revealing visions that some conjurers might not want being made public. It's common practice among conjurers to kill their accuser devils once they've completed their missions of inf iltration and observation.

Achaierai,5,outsider,land,"This bird-like beast is mostly head, lunging forward on four scaly legs. Wisps of noxious black vapor trail from its hooked beak.","An achaierai is a predator and scavenger of the lower planes that looks like a 15-foot-tall flightless bird, though its head and body are fused into one large unit, with four legs and atrophied wings. The thick, oily plumage covering its body all but conceals these tiny wings. An adult achaierai weighs roughly 750 pounds. Though not devils themselves, achaierais live and hunt on the scorched and blasted plains of Hell, where they make excellent use of their long, stilt-like legs in running down lost souls or lesser devils who stumble into their feeding grounds. Once it has closed with its target, an achaierai attacks with its two front legs, punching or slashing, as well as biting with its powerful beak. Far smarter than their animalistic form might suggest, achaierais prefer to hunt in shrieking packs and use their prey's confusion and their own reach to their advantage, circling their quarry and darting in to attack as soon as the victim becomes distracted, then retreating again before the prey has a chance to retaliate. They have been known to wander through battlefields in the lower planes, picking over dying and regenerating creatures and souls, which has earned them the nickname ""Hell's vultures."" As achaierais are immune to the toxic clouds of others of their kind, they often work in conjunction to use these clouds to herd or scatter enemies, form long lines of black clouds to protect their retreat, or merely panic opponents in large melees. Achaierais are fond of disemboweling their targets and feasting on the hot entrails while their mortally wounded prey screams itself to death. Of course, as outsiders, achaierais have no need to eat, and their elaborate hunting routines are simply the bird-beasts' sick form of entertainment.",1600

Adaro,3,monstrous humanoid,warm oceans,"This hybrid of human and shark holds its spear menacingly, thick, glistening saliva dripping from its razor-sharp teeth.","Malevolent denizens of the waters, adaros are among the fiercest sentient hunters of the tropical seas. They are known and feared by sailors on mexotic shores, as well as by common folk who just happen to live near the oceans. Mhave witnessed a fellow sailor or fisher suddenly go rigid, a poisoned spear jutting from his guts, only to fall into the waters and be taken by the vicious adaro responsible for the assault. Strictly carnivorous, adaros feed upon their victims almost immediately after slaying them. Their brutally sharp teeth cut through bone almost as easily as through flesh, and their powerful digestive systems are capable of handling most organic matter. Adaros usually eat once every couple of days, gorging on meals half their weight. Adaros' strange relationship with storms has intrigued scholars for centuries. These sea-dwellers have a special connection to the deadly creatures of the waters and the wildness of foul weather, and it is no coincidence that they attack humanoids more often during rough seas.

Addu,15,magical beast,warm oceans,"Striped with the brilliant colors of a maritime sunset, this beast winds its enormous body through the waves, a pair of wiry, talon-tipped arms and a snout full of horrendous teeth preceding a fan of razorlike fins.","As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners of Golarion's deepest seas. Addu encounters are thankfully rare, but those who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts' unimaginable powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the watersy horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal seafarers' imminent doom. The colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the waters with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds. Ecology Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seaf loors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving waters ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat. Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities. In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watersy lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone. Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among mseafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open waters where these beasts tend to stake their claims. Habitat & Society Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwaters geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle. Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu. Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. waters elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets  appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims. Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death.",51200

In such dens, they keep trophies from their engagements as focuses for meditation and objects of study. Adhukaits also keep treasures stolen from temples and holy places. While at rest, adhukaits remain near ill-gotten items to ensure no meddling magician can locate the lost objects. Legend holds that the first adhukaits emerged from the shattered remains of two godlike brigands. These burglars, their names long since lost to history, attempted to raid a celestial hall. The resident deity and his or her servants slew the thieves, crushed their bodies together into one, and hurled their remains to the earth. As their crumbling, entwined bodies struck the world, they caused terrible earthquakes and tsunamis that slew thousands of innocents-including mworshipers of the headstrong deity who accidentally caused the devastation.

To this end, a dungeon dragon sets up a labyrinthine lair, setting traps and populating it with monsters. Younger dungeon dragons tend to lair in natural caverns to ease the burden of construction. Older, more experienced dungeon dragons have been known to construct their own sprawling subterranean complexes, even to the point of hiring on dwarf work gangs and swearing them to secrecy. Once the construction and refurbishing of its lair is complete, the dungeon dragon transforms itself into a humanoid and ventures into the surrounding countryside. There it spreads rumors and tales of this horrible catacomb in hopes of luring adventurers forth so it may watch them via its crystal ball. Young dungeon dragons often spend years living among humanoids, even to the point of joining adventurers involved in dungeon delves. On such adventures, the intrepid dungeon dragon takes notes regarding the devious traps and monsters it encounters so that it can add such things to its own lair. Oddly enough, although a dungeon dragon goes to great pains to amass a treasure hoard, it cares little for material wealth. Rather, it uses the treasure it gathers as bait in its dungeon to lure in adventurers and provide it the entertainment it so greatly desires.

Advodaza Devil,18,outsider,any,"The rending, thunderous clangor of rushing claws heralds the charge of this fire-eyed ruin, a terror of flame-seared hide and saber-like spines shaped in a monstrously muscled centauric form. The true terrible ferocity of the thing lies hidden, restrained beneath armor and wings of crumbling stone carved with icons as ancient as they are undeniable and profane.","False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-the fiends known collectively as advodazas survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy- the idol-clad advodazas. No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most advodazas stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 9 tons. Ecology Fantastically old beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging power that would listen for protection from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, skies, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard these early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner of cult images. Yet, as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or demonized and rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest demi-deities of countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed power and worship, as well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who had snubbed them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings emerged from the Pit as advodazas. One of the few breeds of devilkind not forged wholly by Hell itself, advodazas prove exceedingly rare compared to other fiends. Habitat & Society All advodazas seek to return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. While merciless, advodazas appeal to mmortal servants due to the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, their servants find no divine realm nor glory seated beside some grand deity. For when they die, there is only Hell.",102400
Aerial Servant,11,outsider,Elemental Plane of Air,This creature appears as a man-sized humanoid composed of grayish-white vapor.

Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being summoned and forced to do the bidding of another; therefore, it attempts to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying the caster back to the Elemental Plane of Air with it. Aerial servants are invisible on the Elemental Plane of Air. On other planes, they can be seen, though only vaguely, and appear as humanoids composed of whitish-gray vapor.

They are the creatures responsible for entire fleets and crews being lost or destroyed. They are thought by mto be the ""kings"" of the sea as most other waters-dwellers pale in comparison both in strength and size to the mighty afanc. Afancs are omnivorous hunters of the deep sea, feeding on a mixed diet of kelp, coral, sea plants, sharks, whales, various other large fishes, and swimmers and sailors unfortunate enough to cross the path of an afanc. Afancs are sometimes worshipped as sea gods by small towns, villages, and seaside communities.

Agathion,4,outsider,waters,"Layers of translucent, shimmering fins flow along this fish-man's spindly body. Tentacles curl below its stately mouth, and its humanlike hands and feet end in stubby but sharp claws. Bishop","Possessing perhaps one of the strangest appearances of all agathions, bishops look as much like fish as they do humans. On their native plane of Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies are needed, such as on watersy planes or worlds that are wholly waters. The few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized duality on land and at sea-goodly sailors, oceans-hopping priests, or kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these fascinating creatures. Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from their chins, and their eyes-which come in all the colors of the tumultuous waves-look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops' bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds. Ecology On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will. Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, mof which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become acquainted with bishops' complex ways. Habitat & Society Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions. The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of waters lies in the southern region of the Embaral oceans, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region. Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an waters species. Some coastlines storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told. Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop.",1200

Ahuizotl,6,magical beast,"warm lakes, rivers, or swamps","This bear-sized beast has a body like a squat simian, a dog's face, and a long tail that ends in a clawed hand.","A carnage-hungry denizen of swamps, the ahuizotl is a ferocious-looking predator, even before one takes into consideration its most distinctive feature-a long tail that ends in a clawed but all-too-humanoid hand. Whether from the entrance of its waters home  or the thick reeds and flora that grow at the waters's edge, an ahuizotl remains watchful for intruder that might trespass into its territory. Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a rivers's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack. Despite its preference for cruelty, an ahuizotl might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. Will-o'-wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o'-wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl's lair and then lingering to feed upon the victims' fear as the ahuizotl drags them into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl's clutches-typically lizardfolk, boggards, or swamps-dwelling humans-have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such arrangements always lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the waters predator's proxy coaxes new victims into the swamps for its fearsome partner to dine upon. Ahuizotls are exceptionally long-lived, and a single individual might live and feed in a particular area for several human generations. An ahuizotl is 9 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds.",2400

They perceive the existence of living things as crucial to maintaining cosmic balance. They also understand the profound inf luence living things have on the cosmos, and if left untended, its ability to create terrible consequences. In this circumstance, life must give way to death. Akhanas wander the byways of the multiverse, constantly on the hunt for imbalances in life. How they judge these imbalances is not well-understood by non-aeons, and the aeons are singularly unmotivated to justify akhanas' decisions when inquired about them. As a result, the focus of akhanas' attacks and attentions usually seems arbitrary or even random to most creatures-they do not always focus their attentions on the strongest or the weakest members of a group. An akhana stands 5 feet in height and weighs 120 pounds. Its strange central body seems vaporous, but is weirdly solid  to the touch.",19200
Akhlut,13,magical beast,"cold lakes, plains, or oceans","A dorsal fin rises up from the back of this immense black-and-white-furred, wolf like beast.","Resembling nothing so much as a killer whale mixed with a wolf, the rarely seen akhlut stalks frigid seas and the frozen lands nearby, shrouded by perpetual blizzards. Legend holds that the first akhlut was born fully-formed in the eye of a polar hurricane, the merciless anger of the elements made flesh. Whether or not the tale is true, the akhlut's ferocity is certainly as memorable as that of storm. While the akhlut appears as a wolf-orca hybrid on land, when it enters the waters, its legs and fur vanish and it transforms fully into the form of an orca. Akhluts are particularly skilled at charging into and out of waters, their transformation between shapes occurring in the blink of an eye. Each akhlut fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it's unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an akhlut is actually preferable. Typically, an akhlut considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its control weather spell-like ability, and rarely travels far from this storm's borders. An akhlut is 22 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.",25600
Akvan,20,outsider,any,"Ornate armor covers this hulking creature, rocky protrusions jutting from its hide and fierce horns crowning its broad head.","Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well. Akvans seek out wonders to destroy-monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves. Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile. Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds. AKVAN PRINCES As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, mgravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes. Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4-8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22-24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts. Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish. Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti's heat special attack , and the following spell-like abilities: at will-quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day-wish. Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet , and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will-invisibility; 3/day-gaseous form, wish.

Alastor,25,outsider,any,This entity stands at least 16 feet tall and its body is entirely cloaked in hellish red and yellow flames. Huge bat-like wings spread from its scaled body. Its arms end in clawed hands which hold a tight grip on a wickedly curved battleaxe of iron. Its eyes are black with red pupils and its mouth is filled with rows of fangs.,"Alastor is thought to be related to, or in fact be, a pit fiend. Legends and stories told by the various rulers of Hell say he is in fact the first pit fiend; the one from which all others were spawned. Alastor has always existed as far as the arch-devils know; none can remember a time before he was there. Though stories say he was thrown down from Heaven when Lucifer and his court were cast down, Lucifer himself has denied such tales. Alastor serves as Hell's Executioner. He makes his lair deep within the confines of Asmodeus's palace on the nethermost circle of Hell. He is loyal to none but Asmodeus, and his loyalty has never been in question. Those who have questioned his loyalty to Hell's arch ruler usually find themselves on the wrong end of his axe. Alastor takes great pride in his job and his blade never falters. When tasked with the execution of a traitor, prisoner, or simply someone Asmodeus has grown weary of, Alastor does the job, neat and clean every time. A mortal killed by his hands finds Hell to be a rather pleasant place compared to the eternal torture most endure once they fall to Alastor's axe. Alastor resembles a pit fiend in appearance and stands 16 feet tall. He weighs roughly 1,000 pounds. Alastor rarely engages in combat; not because he cannot, but because most such encounters are trivial to him and he becomes bored with it very easily. If pressed into battle, he uses his power word kill ability immediately against his closest opponent. Next, he unleashes a meteor storm, followed by a fireball, before finishing his spell-like abilities with a mass hold monster against as mfoes as possible. Next he wades into battle with Grimfang and his array of natural attacks. When he finally becomes bored with the battle, he seeks to quickly end it by calling in other devils to finish off remaining opponents. Should Alastor be in danger at time, he uses his greater teleport to escape, remembering his foes for a later time, which he will invariably hunt down with a retinue of pit fiends and kill.

Allip,3,undead,any,"This malignant cloud of shadows boils in the air, its skeletal maw eerily babbling as the creature's claws manifest from the darkness.","Those who fall prey to madness and take their own lives sometimes find themselves lost on the path to the afterlife, trapped in a state between life and death. These unfortunates, known as allips, suffer from the violent and incurable insanity they faced in life and take out their terror, confusion, and rage upon the living. They reach out to those they encounter-possibly in wrath, but also perhaps oblivious to their own insane nature-spreading the psychoses that led to their own untimely deaths. In combat, allips relentlessly attack the nearest living creature, relying on their babble to let them close in before attacking with their touch of insanity. Mseem to be driven to states of ferocity upon witnessing the terror living creatures exhibit when facing their spectral forms, or when faced with the intangibility of their incorporeal states. While allips have no way to kill creatures, those knocked unconscious by an allip's Wisdom-draining touch often emerge from the state suffering from insanity -a fate that mwould say qualifies as worse than death. Allips often seek to harm those who played a part in causing their mad, unholy condition. When faced with such foes, an allip ignores all other targets that confront it in favor of its hated enemies, attacking them until its tormentors have been forced into a vacant stupor. Alas, such vengeance does not put the allip to rest, but simply serves to further fuel its madness as it finds itself trapped in a world now no longer even holding the satisfaction of vengeance.",800

At rest, an alraune appears to be merely a large thorny plant with a single enormous and brightly colored flower at its center. When an alraune attacks, its thorny vines lash out and its flower blooms, revealing an attractive, green-skinned humanoid form within. An alraune's apparent gender can vary even from encounter to encounter, for the plant can reshape its humanoid portions as it desires to increase the likelihood of setting its victims at ease. Regardless of the plant's apparent gender, it is itself asexual and reproduces  by budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season. Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile . They hunt by using commune with nature to locate potential prey, preferring humanoid flesh over all others. When an alraune needs prey, it uses its mind-affecting abilities to convince foes to dig their own graves and bury themselves-once a foe is helplessly buried in the soil, the alraune can feed from it via its flesh-burrowing roots, converting the victim's blood and memories into the strange nutrients it so craves.",25600

He bred mof the creatures in secret and sealed them into kegs of ale, then hired merchants to distribute this ale throughout the city. The wizard was ultimately slain and the city saved by a band of heroic adventurers. Unknown to the adventurers, the merchants had wanted to line their own pockets without the knowledge of their employer. Unaware of the plot they sold some of the kegs of ale in illegal markets. Now, mof the kegs containing amber oozes have been shipped to other cities and the creatures are spreading. When an amber ooze divides, one of the new creatures seeps out of the keg to find its own lair. Stacked in rows with other kegs of uncontaminated ale, amber oozes can quickly take over a store room or pantry. An amber ooze is approximately 1 foot in diameter, and is a dark amber color.

Amber oozes can lay in a state of hibernation for years, coming out of it only to replicate - a process they undergo once every few months - or when they are alerted by movement of the keg. When a keg containing an amber ooze is tapped, the creature makes its way to the opening. Within the drawing of a few drinks, the amber ooze squeezes out of the tap and into the mug.

Though they appear to be almost human, these artificial wonders are of a completely foreign and utterly alien nature. Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The strange, alien ""forges"" in which new androids are created are hidden in strange ruins in Numeria, and most androids have little to no memories of these regions.

Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front to outsiders. They make no effort to hide annoyance when displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be territorial, though less so than other sphinxes.

Reclusive by nature, high girallon clans settle the most secluded depths of the jungles, generally inhabiting ruined cities and misty mountains temples. There they rule as divine priestkings over tribes of lesser apes. These congregations sometimes even include humanoid slaves or cultists, though the angazhani prefer raiding and collect tribute over commanding direct service. They rarely reveal themselves to outsiders, and instead quietly gather strength against the day their patron sends them out to claim all the world's forests.

To survive, this animate dream needs the power of living will, imagination, and emotion to sustain it. An animate dream seeks out mortal minds, appearing as a shadowy and often frightful dream figure. Its true appearance is vague and nebulous, but it reacts to the fears and emotions of those around it, taking on a nightmarish appearance that differs for each viewer. An animate dream can find satisfaction and sustenance by passing one of its ghostly limbs through a mortal's body-the act infusing the mortal with negative energy that sates the animate dream's unnatural hunger. But by forcing a creature into a state of sleep, terror, or both, the animate dream can gain a much more satisfying meal, feeding on the emotions released in such states. It uses its spell-like abilities to this end, for each creature it harms with its nightmares, drives temporarily insane with confusion or fear, or outright slays with phantasmal killer provides the monster with more nourishment. An animate dream forced to go for a long period of time without feeding does not starve to death, but does grow increasingly feral and violent in nature. Animate dreams sometimes associate with other creatures from the Ethereal Plane or that have associations with dreams and nightmares, such as night hags, phase spiders, and xills. Sometimes these alliances are mutually beneficial, but in mcases the animate dreams are treated as slaves.

Ankheg,3,magical beast,temperate or warm plains,"This burrowing, bug-like monster scuttles about on six legs, drooling noxious green ichor from its clacking mandibles.","Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid f lesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts- such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations.  In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite. Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground. A creature carried underground can still breathe with diff iculty , but is often eaten alive before its allies can rescue it. Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like-they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long . Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too mburrow at once. Although ankhegs resemble immense vermin, they are in fact much more intelligent than the typical arachnid and, given time and a talented trainer, can even be trained to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. The fact that even ""domesticated"" ankhegs are prone to squirting acid when frightened or startled makes them unsafe at best in most heavily populated regions, but for more savage races like hobgoblins, troglodytes, and particularly orcs, ankhegs make popular guardians or even pets.",600
Ankou,14,fey,any,"Cloaked by wings of darkness, this horrific, skeletal alien appears to be burning from within, a flaming glow shining through its emaciated chest. Among this gaunt being's most prominent features are shimmering black wings, sharp talons, and yellow eyes that radiate a lambent malice.","Death is a passing inconvenience to the folk of the First World. If a fey is slain in its home realm, it reforms sometime later from the mutable stuff of reality. To them, violence and mayhem are somewhere between a sport and a mode of criticism. If a fey lord chops the head off one of his knights, it might be little more than a dramatic rebuke. Therefore, the creatures known as ankous should not be considered simple killers. Their duty is not merely to kill-it is to terrify and torture, to wring every iota of suffering out of their target in a pageant of cruelty before the final act, the bloody murder itself. Ankous are the servants of powerful fey nobles who rule with cold-iron fists, and whose subjects live in terror of a visit from the dark ones. They cannot permanently kill those of the First World, but they can make victims long for oblivion. Physically, ankous are a fearful sight-that is, when they permit themselves to be seen, instead of blinding their foes with darkness. The ankous themselves never speak-the only words they can utter are those whispered telepathically into the victim's ear an instant before death, and those words are spoken in the voice of the one who sent the killer. A typical ankou measures approximately 10 feet tall, and about 8 feet across its ebon wings. Exceedingly light, the dark fey seem to be made of little more than shadows and gossamer, weighing less than 100 pounds. Ecology Servants of the Eldest, ankous exist to mete out the displeasure of their masters. The wounds caused by its wings and tail are especially agonizing, and victims have described little shards of crystalline moonlight cutting their way through muscle and bone underneath the skin. The blood-drenched skin of the victim of an ankou occasionally seems to shimmer or sparkle as if from residual moonlight in the corpse. Regardless of whether or not such dreadful whimsy is true, the wounds dealt by an ankou's tail and wings prove particularly vicious, leaving some victims to slowly bleed out from what appears to be nothing more than a mere scratch. The fey's most horrific power, though, is its ability to conjure lesser shadows of itself. The assassin can create duplicates to aid in its attack. A single ankou can block all the exits from a chamber, ripping a victim to shreds with a flurry of slashes from the same claw. These conjured fey are born of shadow and wrath, and are of one mind with the ankou that created them. These lesser copies vanish when the true ankou is killed or is otherwise unable to maintain its focus. Only powerful Eldest can block an ankou's generation of duplicates. Habitat & Society Ankous have no true culture of their own. When not hunting a foe, an ankou slumbers in a cocoon of darkness amid the most shadowy reaches of the First World. They are rarely called to service by their fey masters, as the mere threat of an ankou is often enough to terrify even the most fearless enemy. When loosed upon an especially hated foe, one of these assassins might be told to kill the victim mtimes over-murdering its target, waiting for its connection to the First World to reform it, and then killing it again. Amid the courts of the Eldest, ankous typically lurk as present but needless threats-like weapons hung in a royal hall. While the Eldest themselves prove more than capable of dispatching those who displease them, the flocks of ebonwinged fey nonetheless prove disturbing. What most nonfey typically have difficulty understanding is the lack of malice inherent in assassinations meted out by ankous. On the First World, such acts shock and annoy, but they don't equate to the ultimate punishment that death presents to mortals of the Material Plane. Thus, these grim tormenters of the First World take on new aspects of terror when encountered by non-natives of that realm. In the unlikely event that an ankou's master is permanently killed, the murderous fey wanders as it will. Moody and quick to take offense-whether from the pestering of other inquisitive fey or from trespassers into lands it deems its own-a free ankou proves even more murderous than one employed as an assassin, though far less concerned with repeated murders. Typically they prefer to be left in silent solitude, brooding amid ancient ruins, crumbling castles of forgotten fey lords, or other morbid demesnes. They take particular umbrage at those who bring light or, even worse, song into their dour realms, often resorting to brief tortures before slaying such interlopers. Unfortunately for ankous, daredevil fey pranksters who discover their lairs often make a grim game of invading and taunting these murderous beings, eventually forcing the assassins to relocate to even more unreachable depths of the First World. Numerous ankous once served the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, whose disappearance has long been a matter of debate, wonder, and lurking fear among his immortal brethren and other strange lords of the First World. Devoted to his service and in the fulfillment of some unknowable past order, the ankous of his court have sought their master, slaying mthey believe have had some hand in his disappearance or knowledge of his whereabouts. In the past decades, these murderous fey have come to investigate Golarion, believing that world bears some mark of their lost lord's passage. Whether or not this is true, and whether Golarion now serves as a hiding place for the lost Eldest or merely a step on a greater path, none the ankous have encountered can say-though that hasn't prevent the deadly fey from ending those who arouse their suspicions.",38400

Each mandible has a barb on its inside midway between the creature's mouth and the end point of the mandible.","The ant lion is a vicious insect-like creature that lurks in the bottom of pits and holes feeding on those unfortunates that fall in. An ant lion is about 9 feet long and weighs nearly 700 pounds. Ant lions dig deep, funnel-shaped pits in which to trap their prey. An ant lion pit is about 60 feet across and about 20 feet deep. A creature that steps on the pit must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or slip and fall down into the center of the funnel. It is there the ant lion waits, buried just under the surface of the ground. When prey falls to the center of the funnel, the ant lion surfaces and attacks, using its mandibles to grab and tear its prey.

Apostasy Wraith,6,undead,any,"A broken mask gives this smoky, ghostly figure a bitter, unwavering gaze.","When the souls of the followers of the Living God Razmir reach Pharasma's Court, most are bound for the Inner Court, where their ultimate fate as believers of a false god is decided. These mortal souls are so traumatized by the knowledge of the falseness of their faith that they know only the desire to avenge themselves upon those who so duped them in life. These souls disavow the legitimacy of all gods, and return to the Material Plane to sow their vengeance. An apostasy wraith exists in a state of constant conflict, torn between its burning shame at falling for such duplicity in life and its scorn and hatred toward believers for whom faith proved to be genuine. Their primary motivation is to wreak vengeance upon the false priesthood of Razmir, but that faith's mental conditioning is so effective as to make it difficult for an apostasy wraith to even approach its quarry. If able to overcome its aversion, its wrath is terrible.

Apostate Devil,17,outsider,Hell,"Armored in the ceremonial garb of some grim knight, this figure stands unnaturally still, though the intricate metalwork patterns of its sculpted mantle writhe and shift as if alive. Claws the length of longswords extend from its armored fingers in razor-sharp fans, and no head or helm rests upon its ironclad shoulders. Instead, there hovers only a plain mask, an unnatural facade devoid of all empathy, emotion, or mercy.","Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their slowly ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical brethren. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities' most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the divine and the profane alike. In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise old men, priests who have ""realized their folly,"" and even ""angels"" of truth. Habitat & Society Deimaviggas prefer to spend their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach mears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.",102400

Arach,7,monstrous humanoid,underground,This six-armed humanoid has a lithe build and stands just under sevenfeet tall. It has a narrow aquiline face and bony plates protruding from its thorax and limbs.,"Arachs are a strange union of sentient arachnids and humanoids. With the exception of their heads, they are completely hairless, and their skin ranges from glossy brown to grey and pitch black with white plates on the males and red plates on the females. Mbelieve they were once worshippers of the spider god who long ago were granted this horrid transformation. Arachs live in small colonies  in caves and caverns deep underground. They generally shun other subterranean races preferring to keep compwith their own kind. Occasionally an arach nest makes an alliance with a band of driders though such a union is usually short-lived . A nest is led by the most powerful spellcaster among the members, usually a sorcerer or wizard of at least 7th level. Arach nests include an equal number of male and female members. Both forage and hunt for the nest, and in times of battle, both fight to defend the lair. During mating season, females are less active as they await the birth of their young. Young are always born live and a typical female spawns 1d4 young at one time. Young arachs reach maturity after 6 years. An arach stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Arach spellcasters open with a whirlwind of blows from their swordwielding arms. Arach fighters either opt for multiple blows from their short swords, or wield two large weapons or pole arms with no penalty for off handed attacks due to their use of three arms to balance and attack. An arach spellbinder opens combat with a lightning bolt or touch of idiocy . It follows this with a magic missile assault and then continues the battle mixing sword attacks and spell attacks. All arachs summon spiders in the first round of combat if possible to absorb larger numbers of enemies or quickly overwhelm smaller numbers of foes.

Aranea,4,magical beast,tropical forests,This bloated spider has a hunchbacked body and a gleam of intelligence in its multiple eyes.,"An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a humpbacked spider a little bigger than a human, and weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses the aranea's brain. All araneas have a single alternate form as well-this alternate form is that of a Small or Medium humanoid. Although an aranea can assume a spider-hybrid variant of this form, it cannot use its change shape ability to assume multiple humanoid forms-this additional shape is locked into one unique appearance. Araneas typically gather in small colonies of two to six individuals, making webbed nests high in trees. These colonies work together to research magic, and may change membership mtimes over as individuals leave to pursue their own studies and are replaced by newer members. A single aranea may take on humanoid form and live for years in a humanoid community, never revealing its true nature. Though araneas generally prefer to be left alone, they often prove quite knowledgeable about the ways of magic, and if approached peacefully may be willing to share their expertise for the right price . Skilled spellcasters, araneas try to avoid physical combat and use their webs and spells when they can. Rather than kill their enemies, araneas often subdue opponents and hold them for ransom.",1200
Arbiter,2,outsider,any,"A sphere of bronze and copper set with a single eye, this winged creature has two clawed hands, one of which clutches a knife.","Stealthy, observant, and frequently persuasive, arbiter inevitables are the scouts and diplomats of the inevitable race. Found throughout the multiverse in courts and on battlefields, arbiters keep a close eye on the forces of chaos and do their best to keep the lawful from straying, while simultaneously winning over the hearts and minds of those who might yet be saved. Though their assorted abilities make them extremely useful, arbiters see themselves less as servants than as advisers and counselors, preferring to ride around on their summoners' shoulders and help guide their ""partners"" on the path of law. They detest being summoned by chaotic individuals, and when teamed with such a creature, they aren't above using Diplomacy to try to inf luence the summoner's friends or refusing to undertake actions that seem contrary to their programming. An arbiter who comes across evidence of a significant insurgence of chaos upon a given plane does everything in its power to rally its allies against the dangerous instability, and in situations that are clearly beyond its ability to handle, it may refuse to continue onward until the group agrees to help it reach the nearest greater inevitable and make a full report, or else may travel to Utopia itself and present its urgent information in person. Arbiters typically bear the shapes of tiny clockwork spheres with shiny metal wings. Generally peaceful unless combating true creatures of chaos, arbiters prefer to cast protection from chaos on their allies and use command to make opponents drop their weapons and run. Their most powerful weapon, the ability to release their internal energy as a deadly burst, is reserved for dire need and battles of the utmost service to law, as the resulting period of darkness while they're powered down is the only thing that seems to truly scare the tiny automatons. An arbiter inevitable can serve a spellcaster as a familiar. Such a spellcaster must be lawful neutral, must be at least caster level 7th, and must have the Improved Familiar feat.

Caught within its protoplasmic form are half-digested creatures of various types and sizes.","Arcanoplasms are found in areas where the residual energies of arcane magic linger. Such areas include ruined wizard towers, keeps, dungeons, and so forth. Here they feed and remain until disturbed. Most encounters with these monsters are take place in such locations as the arcanoplasm rarely travels far from its lair. And since it lairs in ruins and other such adventurer-attracting places, it rarely has to wait long between meals. Arcanoplasms always target arcane spellcasting creatures first. Their innate ability to detect such creatures allows them to do so with precision accuracy. Because of its ability to replicate spells cast near it, the arcanoplasm always tries to stay within 30 feet of an arcane caster. Mimicked spells are cast at the foe deemed most threatening. Note that because an arcanoplasm's arcane spell mimicry is a supernatural ability and not actual spellcasting, it cannot absorb arcane energy from spells it casts itself.

Arcanotheign,15,outsider,any,"This woman-shaped cloud of swirling black-and-white energy flickers like lightning, with raw magical power playing about her fingertips.","The Arcanotheign is a mysterious creature serving the mad god Nethys. Because her creator sends her to Golarion on missions to heal, destroy, or spy, she is familiar with creatures of the mortal world, yet still very much an outsider, and she is fascinated by the intricacies of mortal interactions and history. In her natural, incorporeal form, she is a storm of magic, immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. Ever curious, she often asks personal, direct questions of those she is sent to interact with, even as she repairs their wounds or tears their souls from their bodies. Sometimes she is told to assume a physical form, and lives among humanoids as a mysterious oracle for days or weeks, observing those near her and giving cryptic answers to those who dare approach her. She stands just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the ground instead of walking. Ecology The Arcanotheign understands she is foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the same place, she may ""adopt"" those living near her, especially orphaned ones. Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children, though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect it or return it home than to ignore or harm it. Some of these children develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline. Habitat & Society As a supernatural creature created in a moment of lucidity by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own devices when her master does not need her, and wanders Golarion and the planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get information from her. Her affection for animals is related to this; they are simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages.",51200

Aspidochelone,17,magical beast,oceans,"The ground shudders and the seabirds take to wing with piercing cries of alarm. What once appeared to be a small, rocky island reveals itself to be a creature of titanic proportions as an enormous tail lifts ominously from the waters. With a thunderous crash, it slams down, sending the island plunging beneath the waves.","A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the waters, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs. Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, mcastaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for munfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it. An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island. Ecology Aspidochelones universally live in the deep oceans, as only such large bodies of waters can sustain their enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely seen. Thought by mto be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the waters, drifting with the oceansic currents, the whales are frequently mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures' skin for rock or clay. Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger. When they waken, the whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans, seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again. An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world. When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction. Habitat & Society Aspidochelones do not possess society to speak of, as they spend most of their time floating aimlessly about the oceans. When two aspidochelones of the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways, never to see one another again. Among island cultures, a number of myths have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island. Mof these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call men to their deaths.",76800
Aspis Agents,4,humanoid,any,"Richly attired in noble's garbs, this savvy man boasts a colorful cloak, a bulging coin purse, and a fine rapier at his side.","Magnimar's relatively loose laws and the aff luence of the Vista district bring members of the Aspis Consortium to the city in droves. Their primary base of operations in Varisia is located in this district, a bronze-faced building with heavy doors emblazoned with sigils of three intertwined asps. The Aspis Consortium has had a presence in Magnimar for nearly a century, though agents have had to proceed more cautiously of late, following the recent founding of a Pathfinder lodge in the city. Aspis agents in Magnimar favor no particular class, and agents from all walks of life can be found throughout the city. Some are rogues or fighters, while others practice the arcane arts as sorcerers or wizards. Quite a few, however, come from the ranks of bards, utilizing their various skills, social graces, and musical talents to covertly extort buyers, to beat Pathfinders to major finds, or simply to steal such treasures out from under Pathfinders' very noses. As with Aspis headquarters in other parts of the Inner Sea, the leadership of Magnimar's Consortium is broken up into a strict hierarchy of power. The lowest and most common members are paid mercenaries who partake in the various odd jobs assigned by true Aspis agents, whether such tasks involve pillaging Thassilonian ruins or taking care of peskies competitors who would seek to hinder the Consortium's endeavors. Bronze agents are made up of Magnimar's dockworkers, freelancers, and lowly adventurers seeking money and improved status, while those agents wielding silver emblems organize the activities of their underlings throughout the regions surrounding the city. Only a couple gold agents operate in Magnimar, though their inf luence and power extends to nearly all the corners of Varisia, and their word is law as far as lesser agents are concerned. While the NPC depicted here represents a city-based agent who excels at espionage, deceit, and other urbane tactics, those working for the Aspis Consortium in Magnimar take myriad forms. The comphas enlisted warlords and wizards alike, and even some adventuring groups find their way onto the Consortium's payroll-all it takes is the gumption and means to find lost treasures and bring them back to the auction house, as well as a certain lack of ethics and a strong sense of cupidity for those who wish to rise in rank.",1200
Asrai,5,fey,cold or temperate waters,"This being looks like a one-foot tall female elf with delicate features, emerald eyes, long golden hair, and pale blue skin.","Asrai dwell in crystal clear lakes, ponds, and rivers. They can be found in large body of waters far from civilized lands. Most asrai spend their time frolicking and playing in the lakes they call home, dancing among the fish and playfully splashing the various woodland creatures that venture near the waters for a drink. Asrai are protective of their waters homes, however, and attack en masse foolish human so oafish as to not ask their permission to enter the waters. Asrai spend most of their time in the waters, preferring not to touch land if possible. Though they can survive on land for a short amount of time, they prefer not to risk such ventures, so encounter with an asrai is almost always in the waters. Asrai make their homes in giant seashells or natural underwaters caves. These homes are usually concealed under a canopy of waters plants, algae, and seaweed so potential enemies cannot easily find them. Asrai are closely related to pixies and thought to be a relative, though they do not possess wings. Male asrai are thought to exist, though none have ever been encountered. An asrai only engages in combat if its body of waters is threatened, or if intelligent creature other than a fey enters the waters without permission. Once in combat, an asrai prefers to attack with its magic, using its chillsing touch only as a last resort. If it faces overwhelming odds, an asrai seeks escape, often using its fog cloud or obscuring mist ability to cover its exit. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",1600
Assassin Vine,3,plant,temperate forests,"This gnarled vine, as thick as a man's arm and bearing handshaped leaves, convulses across the ground in an unnatural slither.","The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots. These remarkable plants can see minute movements in the earth and air and detect changes in light and heat through their broad leaves, giving them exceptional awareness of the area around them. Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target's size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant's roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries. An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey  in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant's ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby. Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine's seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape. Tales often tell of assassin vines appearing in flower beds or infiltrating greenhouses, murderous surprises planted by rivals and enemies or arbitrary doom dropped by unsuspecting wing.",800

Astral devas are usually created by deities from the souls of good mortals, though some souls spontaneously transform into astral devas without the intervention of a deity.

Asurendra,20,outsider,any,"This four-armed humanoid horror is garbed in golden armor and surrounded by a nimbus of floating, glowing weaponry.","With the notable exception of the unique asura ranas, asurendras are the mightiest of their kind. Although few asurendras possess anything resembling an extended realm, in Hell or elsewhere, these asuras are the ""wise ones"" of asura kind. Most dwell within shrinelike fortresses in which they can practice their ruinous mysticism and command lesser asuras who seek their teachings. To most asuras, an asurendra's order is something akin to a deific edict. Each asurendra is a humanoid creature of immense proportions. Their exact appearance varies just as the appearances of humanoids vary, but all asurendras have six arms and multiple eyes and heads. An asurendra's body is an example of physical perfection, athletically and gracefully built, but its face has monstrous or inhuman features, such as tusks or bizarrely placed features. Most asurendras are 19 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds. Few asurendras were born to their might-they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works. In battle, an asurendra does its best to destroy all enemies, taking a moment to ensure death when foe falls. Asurendras enjoy eating the bodies of fallen foes, and some can even use the flesh and bone of those they consume to create new asuras to serve them. BLASPHEMOUS SAGES Each asurendra follows its own bliss toward a specific method of vengeance against the divine. Like philosophers dispensing wisdom, they teach their ways to others so that more asuras might ascend into perfection. Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their ""enlightened"" hatred. Death: All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living. Sacrilege: Blasphemy is joy to asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design. Shaping: Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper's vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper's hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability. Create Asura : As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a tripurasura  that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as mtripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura-beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.",307200
Atamahuta,11,outsider,temperate mountains,"This large humanoid creature has two heads, one brutish-looking, the other with three eyes and gems and tattoos decorating its forehead.","Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical guise of ettins. Combining oni's trademark guile with ettins' unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inf lict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style. Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds. Ecology While mmight think an atamahuta possesses two heads and is therefore made up of two distinct oni, each being is composed of only one oni spirit. When an atamahuta takes form, it divides its powers into two parts, granting one half of its being its ingenuity and magical prowess and the other its anger and savage strength. An ettin's body is the most suitable for this division of powers, which manifests itself physically as one head having a seeming dominance over the other. The atamahuta's right head most directly controls its actions in physical combat, and is also the only one that talks; the left head, meanwhile, constantly spills nonsense words and mutterings under its breath, and is the source of the oni's arcane power. Oni scholars have speculated that an individual atamahuta's underlying, unvoiced wishes and desires are encoded in the gibberish that burbles from its left head, and that by listening closely enough, one can garner valuable information about the oni spirit, but few have survived an atamahuta encounter long enough to test this theory. Regardless of whatever babbling the left head produces, most witnesses agree that atamahuta strive for power and fear-induced respect more than anything else, and will go to grotesque lengths to garner them, through means both violent and utterly despicable. Atamahuta possess the ability to change shape just as other oni, but the visage of an uncontrollably violent ettin is often even more horrifying to civilized creatures than that of an oni, whom most regard as equally evil but at least somewhat reasonable. Thus, most atamahuta find it beneficial to procure a silver-tongued ally who can act as a gateway to the more powerful and wise oni itself. Once they have established control over a certain realm, atamahuta will usually either kill or enslave their allies, seeing the beguilers as potential threats to their rule. Atamahuta have little patience for individual that wastes their time, and oversee their domain with an unforgiving and steadfast fist. Oni who inhabit the form of an ettin usually possess violent and unruly dispositions to begin with, but most know better than to act brashly when they first arrive in their physical forms and keep their rage at bay-at least until they establish their dominion over the lesser beings around them. Habitat & Society Atamahuta resemble ettins in both temperament and physical form, but their similarities end here. Most atamahuta look down upon the monstrous giants as barbaric, imperfect versions of an ideal form, and impose their superior strength and intellect upon the creatures in order to enslave them. While a single atamahuta can easily coerce and garner the aid of several ettins, the oni tend to establish elaborate slave rings in order to most effectively ""recruit"" high numbers of individuals, including ettins as well as other intelligent humanoids. Several atamahuta oversee the operation, while their shackled minions act as both enforcers of the slavers' rules and prisoners themselves, hoping to garner some miniscule form of freedom through cooperation. Their sheer cunning allows atamahuta to trick their prisoners into thinking this, when in reality the only escape an atamahuta's slave can hope to achieve is through transfer to another owner or death. When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants' guilds and other such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them. With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit an oni or an ettin into their ranks, and even then, mguilds have imposed strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place. Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other oni, as they see them as potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker oni such as yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful oni recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate the beings for their strength, tricking the ettin-shaped oni into thinking they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful oni has used the atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly discarded.",12800

Attic Whisperer,4,undead,urban or ruins,"This thing resembles a gray, emaciated child, with cobwebs and dust for clothes and a fox skull for a head.","An attic whisperer spawns as the result of a lonely or neglected child's death. Rather than animating the body of the dead youth, the creature rises from an amalgam of old toys, clothing, dust, and other objects associated with the departed-icons of the child's neglect. The widely varying materials that fuse together to form these creatures lead to attic whisperers with vastly different appearances. Attic whisperers linger in the places where they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtors' prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded. When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skull-this does not impact the creature's abilities in way, but it usually seeks out a small animal's skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests. An attic whisperers haunts shadowy, forgotten places like old buildings and dilapidated institutions, places that were once homes to both young children and subtle evils. Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their lives-often a scant floor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children. Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some value.",1200
Augnagar,14,outsider,any,"This enormous, spider-like creature has three clawed tails and eight legs connected by leathery webs of flesh.","The immense augnagar is relatively slow-witted. As an outsider, it does not need to eat to survive, yet it remains ravenous and feeds on anything it can overpower. The augnagar prefers the taste of well-rotted flesh- particularly rotted demon flesh-and the horrific curse its bite imparts flavors its meals perfectly. Yet the augnagar's favorite feast is of a much more cannibalistic type. These creatures find the flesh of their own kind to be the greatest delicacy. When an augnagar feeds upon enough of its own kind, it grows enormously bloated such that it can no longer fly, at which point it uses its clawed tails to tear its body apart in a frenzy of self-destruction. From this storm of torn fat and shredded viscera emerges a fully grown thulgant qlippoth-a creature similar in shape to an augnagar, yet much more intelligent and even more dangerous. An augnagar has a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds.",38400
Augur,2,outsider,any,A single eye peers from behind the armor plates and keen-edged blades that compose the cage-like exterior of this tiny flying orb.,"Gory sentinels with a lust for flesh and the myriad bodily fluids contained within, augurs number among the most common-as well as most despicable-kytons on the Plane of Shadow. Having given up their humanoid bodies in favor of the more stealthy and wretched guise of a singular large eye armored in bloodied metal plates, augurs act as spies and sycophants for more powerful kytons. Their miniscule size, sturdy exterior, and unnerving gazes make them ideally equipped for dangerous reconnaissance missions to the Material Plane, where the augurs are able to scout out potential raiding locations or spot vulnerable, lone travelers before their more powerful kyton brethren cross the planes to attack. While their usefulness in tasks of stealth and guile makes augurs deadly companions, their insatiable lust for blood often proves their ultimate downfall. Augurs, like most kytons, find themselves in a heightened state of arousal when witness to the destruction of flesh, but the extent to which these muscular orbs find pleasure in blood is far more treacherous than their more disciplined peers. Maugurs cannot help but indulge themselves when exposed to gore-rolling within and dipping their blades into freshly spilled pools-an unfortunate trait which has led mcareless augurs to their capture or doom. An augur's gruesome appearance is not always self-inflicted. They are sometimes constructed by other kytons who seek to impose an everlasting punishment upon a particularly unwilling mortal sacrifice; the defiant individual's body is cast aside for scraps as its mind and soul are transferred into the monocular shell, producing an augur when the ritual is complete. Augurs are the least pragmatic type of all kytons, and thus the least respected among their peers. The condemnation of an individual's spirit to the cage-like body of a kyton augur is the precedent for a truly agonizing and lonely existence. A lawful evil spellcaster can gain an augur as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A typical augur kyton is 1 foot in diameter and weighs 30 pounds.",600

An avoral's head has a feathery cowl instead of hair, typically brown, white, gray, or golden, and its facial features are bird-like, with a large nose and piercing eyes. Its bones are hollow but strong, making it ideal for flying. Like eagles, avorals have phenomenal vision, and can see fine details even at great distances. Though on their home plane they are content to soar among the clouds and challenge each other to diving contests among the mountains peaks, in war avorals are the scouts, spies, and messengers of the agathions. With their incredible speed, phenomenal eyesight, and magical powers, they can sneak into an area, spy on whatever lives there, silently converse with the local fauna for additional information, and fly or teleport out again with a comprehensive report.

Axiomite,8,outsider,any,"As this lithe humanoid moves, its flesh shimmers and wavers, temporarily breaking apart into motes of shimmering light.","Stewards of ancient, colossal cities on lawful planes, axiomites represent the fundamental search for order. According to their own history, the first axiomites sprang from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the cosmos long before the first gods began to stir-they are personifications of a primordial reality made flesh in an attempt to understand itself. New axiomites are formed from souls much like celestials or fiends, with spirits drawn across the planes to one of the axiomites' humming crystal monoliths, emerging later as purified creatures of law and theory. A particular axiomite may look like humanoid-shaped creature, though the particular form does not affect its abilities in way. Beneath this form, all axiomites are the same-clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations, making them literally creatures of pure mathematical law. Axiomite society is broken into three divisions, each with its own duty and purpose. One devotes itself to the construction and maintenance of inevitables, another to the expansion and construction of their capital city, and the third to continuing the exploration and calculation of the laws and constants that underlie all of reality. Their leader is a gestalt mind formed by the greatest individuals of their race, forming when needed and then dispersing into its component axiomites to put the god-mind's plans into action.",4800
Azer,2,outsider,land,"Heat ripples the air near this squat, brass-skinned humanoid. Its head and shoulders blaze with a mane of fire.","A proud and hardworking race from the Plane of Fire, azers toil in their bronze and brass fortresses, always ready for their long, simmering war against the efreet. Azers live in a society where every member knows his place. Born into a particular duty, usually the trade of his father or mother, an azer continues this task his entire life. A caste system further keeps azer society in line. Nobles, ruling without question, wear decorated brass kilts as their symbol of caste, while merchants and business proprietors wear stout bronze. Copper kilts designate the working class, made up of servants, artisans, and laborers. Able to channel heat through metal weapons and tools, azers almost never use nonmetallic weapons, and usually engage in close melee rather than using ranged attacks. Azers frequently take prisoners, bringing them back to their fortresses and forcing them to labor for a year and a day. The legendary City of Brass boasts an azer population over half a million strong. Most of these unfortunate azers live a life of servitude to their efreet masters. Azers subjected to this slavery still perform their duties without question, preferring to wait out their contracts or hoping their masters die or get overthrown. A dedication to order burns strong in this race, to the extent that some enslaved azers act as taskmasters over their own kin. Beyond the City of Brass, azers are free to live their own lives, often in other planar metropolises crafting goods, selling wares, and running taverns.

Babau,6,outsider,any,This emaciated figure looks like a horned human skeleton smothered within a bone-tight hide of slimy leather.,"The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist- certainly not traits unusual in the demons, yet the babau's penchant for stealth and surprise sets it apart from its generally less-subtle kin. With no need to eat , a babau can wait in ambush for years or decades-their inhuman patience in anticipating a well-conceived murder also setting them apart from the other denizens of the Abyss. Babaus obsess over the act of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence. A babau typically carries a longspear or other weapon with which it can strike at foes beyond its normal reach, but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight with its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that constantly seeps from their flesh prevents them from wearing armor unless it is specially treated or resistant to acid.

Bakekujira,17,undead,oceans,"This hulking, rotted mass of pale blubber and bone looks like it was once a whale. Ghostly flames glow in each of its eye sockets.","The seas of Golarion are home to mlegends both living and undead, but the bakekujiras is perhaps one of the largest among these latter horrors. Some have trouble believing the old stories, but woe to anyone that discovers the truth. These embodiments of corrupted majesty prowl the seas, along with their flocks and schools of pestilent parasites. A bakekujira weighs about 50 tons, though sometimes less, depending on how long it has been decomposing. Bakekujiras are as large as they were in their former lives, measuring from 50 to 60 feet long. Ecology Though the exact circumstances vary, the story of each bakekujira is similar: It was nothing more than an ordinary whale when whalers attacked. The whale managed to escape, but sustained a grievous wound from a whaler's harpoon. It died after days of anger and pain, only to arise as an undead monstrosity bent on taking revenge for its demise. As a bakekujira goes about its new, corrupted existence, it continues to rot until all the flesh is stripped from its bones, leaving behind only an immense skeletal whale. The decomposition process draws all sorts of sea scavengers to the rotting whale, from gulls to fish. However, the flesh of a bakekujira is not only rotten-it is also toxic and deeply infused with negative energy. Any creature that eats of this flesh sickens and dies, only to rise shortly thereafter and continues its existence as an undead thrall inexplicably bound to the bakekujira. Normally these creatures take up residence in and around the putrefied body of the bakekujira, swarming throughout the creature and only emerging to push back who would seek to do harm to their rotting host. The bakekujira is relentless in its mission to upset and capsize vessels reminding it of its descent into unlife, though because of the vastness of the sea, its quarry can be scarce. When a bakekujira does come across a ship, its rage is such that the beast cares little whether the vessel is an actual whaler or just a fishing sloop. The whale pits its full power against the ship, and is capable of capsizing all but the luckiest of ships with the most skilled captains. Bakekujiras are also able to affect the minds of the ships' crews. Their usual song is gentle, evoking thoughts of peaceful days in the sea. However, bakekujiras are able to channel their fury through their music, transferring to their victims the terror and helplessness the bakekujiras themselves experienced in their last moments of life. Using it jaws, tail, and enormous girth, a bakekujira attacks relentlessly until its angry spirit is laid to rest. Habitat & Society While there are stories about pods of bakekujiras collaborating to lay waste to fleets and port towns, it is unlikely that the massive undead beasts would even notice each other. They are creatures of destruction and see other creatures, even their own kind, as mere obstacles in their pursuit to wreak as much havoc as possible. This doesn't mean that multiple bakekujiras never attack the same target; rather, they simply attack independently, motivated by their own individual anger. On rare occasions, large creatures such as giant vultures and dire sharks feed alongside the bakekujira's undead parasites. These creatures frequently succumb to these parasites and join the throng, swimming or flying alongside the bakekujira and taking a more active role than the whale's aura suggests. A GM can enhance encounters with bakekujiras by providing other undead creatures as auxiliary foes. Below is a list of appropriate animals typically encountered among a bakekujira's larger undead parasites, either with the skeleton or zombie template applied.

Balban Demon,8,outsider,any,"This creature stands at least 12 feet tall with a squat, pot-bellied body, massive arms, and thick, rounded legs. Its head resembles that of a trunkless and tuskless elephant. Four great backward curving horns sprout from its head behind its eyes. Its skin is slate gray with darker areas on its underbelly and back.","Almost as stupid as the lowly dretches, balbans are hulking monstrosities standing over 10 feet tall. Demonic generals use these creatures in abundance in their armies, relying on the balban's love for battle, their great strength, and their knack for destroying objects and structures. Balban squads are brutish, hulking, and hard to control. While mdemon lords do employ their services, they are deemed highly expendable and are thus encountered on the front lines of great battle. Balbans spend much of their life battling, not necessarily for survival, but simply because they relish the chaos and bloodshed combat brings. Balbans attack creature they encounter on sight, except those they know are more powerful than themselves.

Balor,20,outsider,any,"This winged fiend's horned head and fanged visage present the perfection of the demonic form, fire spurting from its flesh.","When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what most envision is a towering figure of fire and flesh, a horned nightmare armed with flaming whip and sword flying through the night in search of its latest victim. The demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in strength or brutality. On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals or captains . A balor typically commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join a fight, few balors choose to resist. In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee-with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter tactic and still inf lict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks to flee via teleportation, but if that and flight prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host. A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds. Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor-unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the birthing of a new balor. Balor Lords Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides , and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions , their power is vast indeed. A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster , and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger , but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods. In addition to benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield. Lifedrinker  Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell . This ability can activate up to once per round. Master of Magic  The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities . Soul Swallow  As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Fortitude save  or die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately transforms into a demon under the balor lord's command .",204800
Baluchitherium,8,animal,warm forests,"This towering armored herbivore resembles a hornless rhinoceros, but with longer legs and a longer neck.","The immense baluchitherium stands nearly 18 feet high at the shoulder, measures 30 feet from end to end, and weighs 40,000 pounds. Despite its size, it lives a peaceful life pulling leaves from the tops of trees unless startled into action. When panicked, a baluchitherium tramples obstacle in its path. If confronted, it smashes its tormentors with its elephantine feet.

Banderlog,2,monstrous humanoid,warm forests,"This creature appears as a short, baboon-like creature with grayishbrown fur.","The banderlog is a somewhat intelligent baboon-like primate that makes its home in warm forests and jungles. Though it appears as a larger version of the common baboon, it does not keep compwith or associate with normal baboons. Banderlogs' intelligence allows them to form small tribal communities for protection and companionship. The leader of such a community is usually the largest and strongest banderlog of the tribe. It is not uncommon to find more than one tribe in the same area. Banderlogs generally coexist quite well with other banderlog tribes, though if food becomes scarce, they attempt to drive off all other tribes in the area. Banderlogs sustain themselves on a diet of fruits and nuts, with coconuts being their favorite food. Though omnivorous, they rarely eat meat of sort. The typical banderlog stands just over 4-feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Banderlogs are non-aggressive unless they are threatened. They prefer to attack opponents from a distance using small rocks or coconuts to hit their foes. Should they be engaged in melee, they attack using a vicious bite. Banderlog Characters Banderlogs have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Most banderlogs are barbarians or rangers. Most banderlog spellcasters are adepts.

Bandersnatch,17,magical beast,forests,"This six-limbed beast stalks forward with a fluid grace. Barbed quills run along its back, and its eyes glow with a blue light.","Bandersnatches are consummate hunters, and only the deadliest predators or the most cunning intelligent prey offer them sport. Once a bandersnatch has marked a creature for death, it runs it to ground without fear, rest, or remorse. Bandersnatches rely on speed, shock, and terror to bring down prey. They pace their quarry from a distance, hidden among the trees, then break from cover, savage their target, and dart away again. They drag smaller creatures away to dispatch at leisure, while engaging larger ones in skirmishes until they gradually wear their prey down. An outmatched bandersnatch withdraws at full speed, from their allies. Once its wounds heal, the bandersnatch returns to the scene of its defeat, picks up the trail of its assailants, and eliminates them one by one. In appearance, a bandersnatch resembles a tawny, six-legged great cat, but with wickedly barbed quills running the length of its body and down to the tip of its long, flexible tail. Its quills serve to deter attackers, but also act as a formidable weapon. With a single flick of its muscular tail, a bandersnatch can fling as mas a half-dozen quills at distant foes with surprising accuracy. A bandersnatch captivates prey that meets the gaze of its saucerlike, luminous eyes. A bandersnatch measures 40 feet in length plus another 10 feet of tail and weighs 12,000 pounds. Despite their bulk, bandersnatches move with speed, grace, and even considerable stealth when required. Bandersnatches were once native to the primal world of the fey, where they preyed on the greatest hunters of that ancient realm. As with other legendary creatures from this realm, such as the jabberwock, bandersnatches belong to a group of creatures known collectively as the ""Tane."" Whether the fey were careless in guarding their portals or released the first bandersnatches into Material Plane deliberately cannot be said with certainty. Rare in the extreme on the Material Plane, bandersnatches lair within forgotten forests where ancient beasts walk the world. Bandersnatches mate only rarely. A female becomes fertile perhaps once or twice per century, leaving the male soon after mating and giving birth to only one or two kittens per litter. The mother brings meat to her ravenous young, which mature into lesser bandersnatches  within a year. Bandersnatches live for a thousand years or longer. VARIANT BANDERSNATCHES Though no bandersnatch is ordinary, some are rarer than others. The most famous is the frumious bandersnatch, brimming with rage so fierce it burns. Variant bandersnatches may combine two or more of the abilities below. Confounding Bandersnatch : Confounding bandersnatches drip infectious madness from their quills and claws. Poison  Claws and quills-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect confused for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Frumious Bandersnatch : A frumious bandersnatch seethes with barely repressed rage and anger. If it misses with its bite attack or falls below half of its hit points, it succumbs to such uncontrollable fury that it bursts into flame. While engulfed in these flames, a frumious bandersnatch is affected as by a haste spell  and causes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage with each of its melee attacks and its quill defense ability. The fury lasts for 5 rounds, after which the bandersnatch cannot enter a fury again for another 5 rounds. A frumious bandersnatch has fire resistance 30. Lesser Bandersnatch : Smaller or younger bandersnatches are still fearsome predators in their own right. A lesser bandersnatch is Huge, with 4 fewer Hit Dice than a typical bandersnatch. Reduce its physical ability scores by 4 each and its Wisdom and Charisma by 2 each. A lesser bandersnatch lacks quick recovery and deals 1d8+4 points of damage with its quill defense and pain abilities. Lesser bandersnatches never have additional variant powers. Magicbane Bandersnatch : These bandersnatches radiate an antimagic aura in a 20-foot radius. Should the aura be brought down, it returns automatically as a free action on the bandersnatch's next turn. Magicbane bandersnatches lack gaze and quick recovery. Primal Bandersnatch : Primal bandersnatches have kept their ties to the ancient world of the fey. They have the extraplanar subtype, SR equal to 11 plus their CR, DR 10/ cold iron, and the advanced creature simple template.",102400

Baobhan Sith,6,fey,forests,"This creature appears as a female elf with pearl white skin, golden hair, and eyes of emerald. Her figure is sleek and curved and she moves with a cat-like grace.","Baobhan sith  are evil female fey that feed on the blood of living creatures. By entrancing creatures with their dance, they lure men to their deaths. Baobhan sith are always female; no males of this race are known to exist. These creatures are generally found in remote locations such as unclaimed forests or overgrown and ruined keeps, castles, or the like; always a secluded location, but close enough to a populated area that the baobhan sith can feed when hungry. Their lairs are typically clean; the monsters have disposed of the rotting corpses of past victims. They are solitary creatures and never work in groups. Baobhan siths each have their own hunting ground and to intrude on another's is certain death. Baobhan siths prefer to use their abilities against male humanoids, particularly elves or humans. They generally avoid dwarves and halflings, though if food is scarce they have no qualms about draining the blood of just about living creature. They do not drink the blood of animals; no matter how hungry they are, as they see this as primitive and savage. A baobhan sith stands 5 to 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 120 pounds. Her hair ranges in color from black or brown to golden yellow. Eye color varies but is usually brown or green. A baobhan sith wears flowing, loose-fitting robes or tunics of white often tied at the waist with a scarf of red or black. A baobhan sith prefers to attack a lone target and generally avoids combat with groups, fleeing if confronted by such a party. Stragglers are often the subject of the baobhan sith's attention if the straggler is far enough behind its comrades. When first encountered, a baobhan sith opens combat with her captivating dance. Creatures that fail to succumb are entangled. Once she has captivated at least one foe, she moves in and sinks her teeth into its chest or throat and drains blood. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, the baobhan sith uses her entangle ability  and tries to slip away into the surrounding forests. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400

It is said his castle is a maze of twisting rooms and corridors, with his personal throne room located at the heart of his maze keep. Those that have ventured there remember little about the place other than the never-ending corridors and maze of rooms. Baphomet stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. Baphomet attacks using his bite, butting with his head, and slashing with his Huge halberd, Musileim. He is relentless in combat and rarely shows mercy to his opponents. Should he become bored with combat, he summons a slew of demons or minotaurs to dispatch of his opponents as he stands and watches the slaughter. Baphomet's natural weapons, as well as weapons he wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. His natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Servants of Baphomet Followers of Baphomet are usually minotaurs and fiendish minotaurs and consist of clerics, necromancers, and sorcerers or adepts. Devout followers of Baphomet are called Horned Ones and must sign a pact of evil with Baphomet. Horned ones are granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, and War.

Barbed Devil,11,outsider,any,"From the tip of its lashing tail to the serrated features of its fangfilled visage, this fiery-eyed sentinel bristles with barbs.","Sentinels of the vaults of Hell, jailers of the darkest souls, and living weapons of the infernal forges, barbed devils-known as hamatulas to diabolists-enforce the strictures of the damned and safeguard the nefarious works of greater devils. A hamatula enjoys the feel of warm blood on its spines, and prefers to leap into melee when presented with an opportunity for battle. Hamatulas are collectors and organizers, and are favorite allies of greedy summoners as they often bring with them tempting treasures from Hell's vaults or know the paths to deadly riches. Left to their own devices, the lairs of these devils often bear the pierced trophies of their past victims, hung like perverse bug collections on bloodied walls. Most barbed devils stand upward of 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, though their leanly muscled bodies appear much larger due to the constantly growing and adjusting spines that protrude from their razor-sharp bodies.",9600
Barbegazi,1,humanoid,cold hills or mountains,"This humanoid stands just over 3 feet tall and has white hair, glossy white skin and deep blue eyes. Its beard is long and flowing and appears to be made of icicles. Its feet are large and flat.","Barbegazis are often referred to as snow or ice gnomes, a name they do not appreciate. They inhabit frigid hills and mountains where they spend their time engaging in activities they enjoy: hunting, fishing, and wrestling. Barbegazi homes are constructed of large blocks of ice and stone and are often built into the sides of hills and mountains or are in fact part of the mountains itself. Their homes are frequently targeted by white dragons . A barbegazi prefers to avoid combat, using misdirection and deception  whenever possible to mislead and detour potential opponents. If a barbegazi knows an enemy is coming, it will most certainly have several traps and snares in place by the time the enemy arrives. If a barbegazi engages an opponent, it usually opens combat with its icicle blast before moving to attack with its short sword. A barbegazi is not stupid and will not risk its life in battle . If forced to flee, a barbegazi burrows into the snow and attempts to escape. Barbegazis stand about 3 and a half feet tall and weigh 45 pounds on average. Barbegazi Society A barbegazi clan is led by the eldest male. Females play a lesser role than males in barbegazi society, though mare as capable  than mof the males in the clan. Young barbegazi are trained from a young age in the art of combat and survival. Aside from white dragons, barbegazis have tolerable relations with most cold-dwelling races and often initiate trade with frost giant clans. Typical goods traded by a barbegazi clan are furs and meat. They do not associate or particularly care for frost men . Barbegazi Characters Barbegazi leaders tend to be rogues or clerics.

Baregara,12,outsider,warm forests,"This lumbering apelike monster has blood-red fur, twisted horns, and a hideous fanged orifice set in the center of its chest.","Although natives of the Abyss that often serve as minions for powerful demons or demon lords, baregaras are not in fact demons themselves. Some scholars classify them as ""proto-demons""-monsters like bebiliths or xacabras that could perhaps someday complete their supernatural evolution into full demonic glory, but that have not quite yet reached that end. Of course, to the baregara's victims, these debates are incidental. In the Abyss, baregaras form small troops just like the apes of the Material Plane. These troops are led by the strongest fighter or an individual anointed by a powerful demon the baregara troop serves. Rivalries between troops are part of a complex hierarchy that is all but incomprehensible to non-baregaras, but planar scholars have observed that all baregaras take trophies from notable kills, and that these grisly mementos play some role in establishing the convoluted social standing of the troop leaders and their followers. Even when knuckle-walking on their enormous hands, baregaras stand over 12 feet high when measured to the top of their horns, and their dense bodies can weigh up to 1,500 pounds.",19200

Barrow Rat,0.25,magical beast,underground,"A chattering swarm of large, sickly looking brown rats emerge from everywhere. The creatures appear both half starved and agitated to aggression.","Barrow rats are scavengers by nature and prefer to feed on dead animals or rotting corpses, even going as far as to gnaw through a wooden coffin to eat the flesh of a newly dead and buried creature. Food that is not immediately devoured is ripped into smaller pieces that can be carried and is whisked back to the barrow rat's nest and stored for later consumption or fed to the newborn barrow rats. Barrow rats are 15-inch long brownish-gray rats with long gray or brown, hairless tails. Their underbellies are lighter in color than their fur often appearing white in some rare species, but usually appearing light brown or slate. Some barrow rats have a dark brown or black stripe on their dorsal side that runs the length of their body. Barrow rats are not as numerous or populous as their normal relatives and are generally only encountered near barrow mounds or graveyards. Most encounters are at night as the rats sleep in underground burrows during daylight hours. A typical barrow rat nest holds 10-40 of the creatures with an additional 10-40 noncombatant young. One or two males dominate the nest. Typically there are two or three females that dominate the colony, but remain subordinate to the dominate male. Young are born live and a female typically gives birth to 3d8 young. The typical gestation period for a barrow rat is 1 month and young reach maturity in 3 months. Young are born blind and hairless and are completely dependent on their mother for several days thereafter. Young open their eyes around 20 days and the mother weans her young after about one month. Young barrow rats gain the stone skin ability at 30 days after birth. Barrow rats rarely engage in combat with creatures much larger than themselves, preferring to flee when confronted. Smaller creatures are attacked from ambush and swarmed by the rats. If threatened or cornered, a barrow rat activates its stone skin ability for defense and either attacks with its bite or simply flees. Multiple barrow rats swarm an opponent. If their nest or young are threatened, barrow rats fight to the death. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",100

Basileus,15,outsider,any,"This comely young man is clad in fine silken robes and gold thread, with hair the color of sunbeams. He smiles slyly, and his eyes smolder with Hellish flames and the suggestion of power and terror beyond mortal reason.","An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and blasphemous, the entity called the Son of Suns, Prince of Paradises, Jadros Voax, Baphon, Vexsoul, or simply Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have faced the messenger of the Archfiend survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell. Typically appearing as a youth of stunning beauty and of the same race as those who look upon him-even when appearing before those of multiple races-little in the herald's comely appearance, finery, or proud bearing sets him apart from the vainglorious princes of countless mortal nations. In his radiant eyes, though, dance hellfire flames and a hint of the power he bears himself and often offers. To encounter Basileus is to know the interest or ire of the lord of Hell himself. Like his master, the herald knows no love for mortalkind, striving only to fulfill the worlds-spanning master schemes of the Prince of Darkness and draw souls into the grip of Hell by the legion. As such, he most often serves as an envoy between Asmodeus and other deities and extraplanar figures of note, rarely deigning to set foot upon the raucous and uncouth Material Plane. When his master's will dictates he travel to the mortal realm, though, his words bear all the weight of Hell, and typically offer temptations few souls can hope to refuse. Occasionally his master bids him answer the summons of the few mortals who hold the Prince of Darkness's favor, but even these forays typically prove subtle steps toward some greater infernal goal. In his humanoid form, Basileus appears as a 6-foottall mortal of surprising but unnatural beauty, with a languid voice like warm wine over silk. Although typically of male gender, this is not always the case, though he always appears before his lord in masculine form. Much of his form is an illusion, though, and a highly subjective illusion at that. Those who can see past Basileus's shrouds of innate deception find a human-like figure resembling the idealized form he presents, though still appearing somehow hollow. The most daring and ancient fiends have suggested that Basileus bears a resemblance to Baalzebul before Asmodeus punished the archdevil by stripping him of his angelic appearance-a rumor that leads the lord of the seventh to loathe his master's herald even more than he despises most creatures. A Thousand Terrors Through the millennia, dozens of immortal beings have served as heralds of the Prince of Darkness-even Baalzebul holding this position for a time before his cursed advancement to archdevil. Yet without fail, each herald has eventually overstepped his bounds and garnered Asmodeus's disfavor, facing a quiet, ignominious, and likely torturous end within Nesus's depths. Yet even after his past heralds' march of disappointments, Asmodeus holds Basileus as the most perfect of all his emissaries, for rather than elevating the messenger from among the ranks of his diabolical legions, the lord of Hell personally crafted his servant to meet his every expectation. An infernal automaton of sorts, Hell's herald is a being zealously devoted to the Prince of Darkness, even beyond the allegiances of devilkind, archdevils, or the Pit itself. Mamong Hell's infernal hierarchy have whispered of their lord's herald's true nature, suggesting that he is a terrible amalgam, drawn from the painwracked nightmares of the Archfiend's past emissaries; a being shaped from the deepest proto-stuff of Hell itself; or even a vaporous being distilled from a measure of Hell's collective suffering. Regardless, the ever-changing physical nature of Asmodeus's herald and his unwavering loyalty to his master are widely known throughout the planes and beyond. On the Material Plane, Basileus has become a legend in his own right. Although rarely visiting the worlds of the mortal realm, wherever he treads he takes the form of the greatest terror of the age. Such leads to highly varied reports of the herald's form and nature, even among Asmodeus's worshipers, and the confusion and apprehension seem to please both Basileus and his master greatly. Among the Prince of Darkness's enemies, Basileus is a thousand horrors known by a thousand names. Tales of his appearance across Golarion have granted him a dozen terrible names: the Bleeding Oliphaunt, Baphon Reborn, and the Seventh Spawn being among those most often heard in fearful whispers. Each of these titles and countless more have been recorded by scholars of the divine outside the church of Asmodeus, with such disparities, though inaccurate, still capturing the deceit inherent in the herald's form and a measure of the horror that is Basileus.",51200
Basilisk,5,magical beast,any,"This squat, reptilian monster has eight legs, bony spurs jutting from its back, and eyes that glow with pale green fire.","The basilisk, often called the ""King of Serpents,"" is in fact not a serpent at all, but rather an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends credence to this claim. Basilisks live in nearly terrestrial environment, from forests to deserts, and their hides tend to match and ref lect their surroundings-a deserts-dwelling basilisk might be tan or brown, while one that lives in a forests could be bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses-the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk. Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs. An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns. Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse. For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.",1200

Baykok,9,undead,any,This howling corpse swoops through the air with hideously elongated legs and a bow made of bone.,"When hunters become utterly obsessed with the chase and indulge excessively in the savagery of the kill, their souls become progressively tainted. When such remorseless hunters perish before they can capture and kill their quarry, they sometimes rise from death as baykoks- flying undead horrors that kill purely for the ecstasy that only murder can bring them. Unlike mundead who feed on and hate all living things, a baykok seeks always to prove its mastery of the hunt. Though thoroughly wicked, baykoks often ignore all but the most powerful-looking foe in a group, only picking off lesser creatures if they dare to get between the baykok and its true prey. When it finally lays low its quarry, the baykok swoops down on the victim to devour the creature's soul in an attempt to make sure the creature never returns to seek revenge.",6400
Bearded Devil,5,outsider,any,"This seething devil deftly wields a vicious, saw-toothed glaive, while below its toothy maw writhes a hideous, twitching beard.","Elite warriors in Hell's legions, bearded devils-or barbazus-fight savagely in the name of their infernal lords and command mindless hordes of the damned into battle. They collect and train with their infernally forged glaives among the vaults of Hell's third layer, Erebus, but inevitably return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the side of the dread lord Barbatos. Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater reach , they drop their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards. At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall  and weigh upward of 200 pounds.",1600

Far more intelligent than its verminous shape would suggest, it is perhaps a blessing that the bebilith is such a focused and devoted hunter of demons, for had these dangerous outsiders more of a mind to conquer and expand empires, their ability to plane shift would make them a menace indeed. Although, as an outsider, the bebilith has no biological need to eat, it does enjoy the sensation of chewing on demonic flesh.",6400
Bedlam,9,aberration,underground,"This creature has no set form. Before your eyes it seems to shift from a vaguely humanoid form with yellow eyes and no other discernible facial features to a swirling mass of grayish-black crackling matter. In its latter form, blue-gray energy arcs and dances through its form, making it resemble a thundercloud shot through with lightning. It seems to constantly alter its form, as if it has no control over it.","A bedlam has no control over its form, but its ever-shifting form does not hamper its abilities in combat. It is a semi-amorphous, nearly vaporous creature composed of pure chaos that makes its lair in areas tainted with strong concentration of chaotic energies, such as temples to chaotic gods or areas that were once lawfully-aligned but have been poisoned by the effects of chaos. Bedlams are sometimes employed by chaotic wizards or clerics to guard a particular area. Being intelligent, the bedlam is strikes a deal with said employer so that it benefits from the bargain as well. Such deals never last long as the bedlam is an unstable and erratic creature, given to flights of fancy. A bedlam enjoys chaos and seeks to spread it wherever it goes. Bedlams seek to induce chaos and destroy or weaken law with every move. Since it continuously detects law, it uses this ability to discern whether or not those it encounters are of a lawful nature or not. Nonlawful creatures are generally just subjected to one or two chaotic bursts before the creature moves on. If lawful creatures are present, the bedlam unleashes a chaotic burst and moves to melee, forming two limbs from its chaotic mass which it uses to pound its opponents.

Behemoth Golem,17,construct,temperate or warm deserts,No text supplied,"Behemoth golems are elephantine constructs once crafted by the artificers of the ancient Jistka Imperium. Rather than use elemental spirits to fuel the constructs' animation, artificers made pacts with demons, daemons, and devils from the evil Outer Planes, and bound their spirits to these titanic horrors to bring them to life. Though from a distance they resemble armored mammoths with a castle attached to their back, a behemoth golem's flesh is in fact made of tons of mined stone, and its tusks and teeth are carved from rare minerals similar in density to ivory. The main body of a behemoth golem is 40 feet tall, with the highest part of the tower reaching 60 feet. Construction While the methods for creating a behemoth golem are largely considered lost along with so much Jistkan lore, a character who finds herself in possession of one of Jistka's fabled behemoth golem manuals gains the knowledge required to construct such a mammoth being.

Making them even more dangerous is the fact that they are practically carnivores-while not above eating plant matter, they devour carrion or foolish creatures that come too close.",9600
"Behemoth, Ravener",18,magical beast,"forests, hills, jungles, or plains","The ground quakes as a colossal, elephantine beast of rocky, armored plates presses forward. Elaborate horns crown its head, and multiple rock-encrusted tusks jut from its toothy maw. With a bellowing roar, the creature shakes its massive head in challenge, then paws the ground and charges.","Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastlines waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the waters. Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the mminerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything. Ecology Behemoths have existed since the birth of the First World, where they served the gods as work beasts, intelligently shaping and transforming the land to a divine plan. However, when such work ended, some gods sought to put down their creations, hunting them to near-extinction. Others simply forgot them or left them to die as the First World faded away. But mbehemoths stubbornly refused to abandon their life's purpose and crossed into the greater world, migrating in an effort to stay close to their creators. Unfortunately, as part of the journey, or because they lost the divine sponsorship of the gods, mbehemoths devolved, losing their sentience and becoming nothing more than monstrous animals and creatures of legend. The ravener behemoth exists as one such example. Driven mad by the inattention of the gods and filled with anger over their abandonment, the raveners found a new purpose. Desperately hungry, these multi-stomached behemoths wholly devoted themselves to feasting upon the bounty of all the gods had created, gorging themselves in an effort to fill the void left by their masters and attract the gods' attention once again. Unfortunately, because of their lowered intelligence, most raveners can no longer answer when such attention finally comes, lacking the will or ability to communicate with their creators, and consumed by an all-encompassing hunger instead. The gods mostly leave such behemoths alone, ashamed and reluctant to fully extinguish their enduring spirits. More often, the gods challenge their mortal champions by directing them to deal with such creatures in their stead. Habitat & Society Most ravener behemoths live solitary lives, as their insatiable appetites cause too much strain on a single ecosystem to support more of their kind. Inevitably, when their paths do cross, two possible outcomes emerge. The beasts either do battle to establish dominance over one another, or every 50 years, certain hormones in female raveners can invoke a natural mating instinct between the behemoths instead. A pregnant ravener may produce up to 1d3 offspring per mating cycle, but it then drives off its mate to ensure enough food remains in the area to raise each cub to young adulthood. Raveners may live up to 1,000 years while food sources remain, and frequently migrate when famine strikes. Behemoths of Legend Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial, Sylvan, and Terran. Spell-Like Abilities : Always active- nondetection; At will-create waters, detect animals or plants, purify food and drink, soften earth and stone; 3/day-cure critical wounds, heroes' feast, move earth, plant growth; 1/day- find the path, restoration",102400
Behir,8,magical beast,warm hills or deserts,"This slithering, multilegged blue reptile has a fearsome head crowned with two large, curling horns.","Temperamental and avaricious, the behir spends most of its time slithering through the sandy hills and deserts cliffs that make up its territory, preying upon all creatures who dare to enter its hunting grounds. The creature's six pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against its sides most of the time, only extending in combat to grapple foes or carry the behir forward in a terrifying, low-slung gallop, or else when climbing the sheer cliff faces common to behir lairs. The average behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its head, mhave additional decorative spines at regular intervals along the central ridges of their backs. While territorial and bestial in its fury, the behir is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its selfcenteredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its high lairs frequently bring it into conf lict with other races. As such, a behir can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a behir's tendency to attack first and ask questions later  means that anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress the behir immediately with his offer. It's often been speculated that behirs are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link remains unknown. Most dragons deny such association and look down on the behir for its relative lack of intelligence-a snubbing that infuriates the already short-tempered behir. Thanks to this casual disparagement, mbehirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause who cross into their territories.",3200

Belkers create no permanent lairs, but do claim and defend large territories from other living things, particularly areas ravaged by frequent storms, volcanic eruptions, hot springs, or forests fires. Some sages believe the belkers worship these dangerous natural phenomena; others speculate the elementals somehow feed on the unusual air from these sites.

The belostomatid's front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on each side of the creature's rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike proboscis to inject its deadly acidic enzymes into its victims. Belostomatids are ambush predators. They hide amid floating snags and piles of debris in still and slow-moving waters, seamlessly blending in with their surroundings despite their size.

Beluiri,15,outsider,any,This creature appears as a bronze-skinned female standing about 6 feet tall. Its head is hairless and features four downward-curving horns jutting just above its forehead. The two lower horns are smaller than the topmost horns. A ridge of small spines runs from the creature's brow down the center of its head and tapers off just below its shoulder blades. Its hands end in razor-sharp talons and its eyes are sapphire blue.,"Beluiri is one of the mconcubines of Lord Baphomet . She is known throughout the Abyss as the Temptress, for in her mdisguises she has seduced countless princes, lords, and generals of the Abyss. In the end, she most often betrays those that fall victim to her wiles. She is hated for this by more than one noble or lord of the Abyss. She sometimes journeys to the Material Plane  to tempt and seduce mortals, for she knows that all mortals, in their hearts, always give in to their true desires-be it power, greed, lust, or one of mcountless other sins. Beluiri rarely wears clothing, but at times when she does, she enjoys gowns and robes of gold, white, and red. Beluiri prefers subterfuge rather than directly assaulting an opponent. She usually alters her appearance to appear as an attractive member of a potential victim's race; once the victim is lured in, she assumes her true form and attacks.

Berserker Cannibal,3,humanoid,any,This howling berserker has milky white eyes and an enormous axe wielded by muscular arms.,"The people of Kalva are a brutal and merciless tribe of cannibalistic barbarians. While they are most often encountered on their desolate, dreary isle, their hunger sometimes drives them to nearby shorelines. That the Kalvamen are poor shipbuilders and even worse at navigation is a blessing, for it keeps them from being a greater danger than they already are. Nevertheless, enough of them make it to the mainland to cause problems, and the fact that they often wreck their ships in the process and thus become stranded makes them even more dangerous. Often known as berserker cannibals, these degenerates delight in stalking, ambushing, and devouring foreign humanoids. Well practiced at hunting in Kalva's forbidding terrain, berserker cannibals prefer to silently creep up on a victim before launching forward with gargling shrieks. Eager to dismember prey with their greataxes in a bloody frenzy, these berserkers tend to only use their javelins against flying creatures, or those that can outrun them. Those unfortunate enough to survive the initial attack, or who make the poor choice to surrender to the berserkers, face a horrific fate. The berserkers drag living bounty back to their camps or caves, where they keep their prisoners ""fresh"" as long as possible by amputating and consuming their limbs one at a time. Each tribe has a few members capable of forging high-quality weapons and armor. Iron and steel aren't common on the isle of Kalva, and when the metals do appear in their societies, shamans are quick to use them to forge magical greataxes for the berserkers. While the berserkers spend much of their time roaming the island's interior on the hunt for sentient creatures, they also take time to plant and harvest hidden fields of crops in the island's rich volcanic soil. The crops serve as a contingency for times when the berserkers can find neither human nor beast to slaughter. The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric visions or fuel the berserkers' battle rage. Continued consumption of these lichens is the cause of the Kalva berserkers' white eyes.",800
Besmaran Priest,4,humanoid,oceans or coastlines,"Clad in black silk and a chain shirt, this bold woman has a strong stance and wields a masterfully crafted rapier; the tricorne hat atop her head depicts a skull and crossbones.","Priests of Besmara are common fixtures on pirate vessels sailing the Shackles, simultaneously serving as healers and spiritual guides for comrades who often have no time for religion until death is already grinning in their faces. While clerics of Besmara often end up captaining ships of their own, they usually spend most of their pirating careers as first mates or ship's surgeons. When not needed to confront a more immediate peril, a cleric of Besmara sees to the health of the crew, purifying spoiled food and waters, healing the inevitable injuries sailors acquire in the course of their duties, or curing crew members of the diseases so widespread in the tropics and the sordid brothels that are a staple of every seaside town. If these duties spare her time, a Besmaran priest goes out of her way to assist others in their tasks onboard and learn everything there is to know about running a ship and crew, for there is no telling what duties will be required aboard Besmara's own Seawraith should the cleric earn a coveted berth in the afterlife. In addition, every priest of Besmara is expected to make a pilgrimage to the mysterious island called Besmara's Throne at least once in her life, and shipmates greeting a cleric upon her return are often struck by the renewed fervor with which she sets about her tasks.",1200
"Bhuta, minor",6,undead,land or underground,"This creature appears to be a decayed humanoid whose body still shows signs of trauma. Its flesh, where it still exists, is pulled tight over its skeletal frame.

Since the transformation into unlife is almost instant , the bhuta appears as it did in life. Close inspection  reveals slight decay, and the body still shows signs of trauma suffered prior to death , but outwardly, the bhuta for the most part appears as a normal creature of its race. In its undead state, the bhuta sustains itself on a diet of flesh, preferring that of humans and elves. A bhuta attacks with its claws in combat. If facing its killers, it uses its death grip attack on the one who actually killed it  and usually only releases its hold when either it or its target is dead.

Bhuta,11,undead,aboveground natural area,"This ghostly apparition floats in the air on backward-facing feet. Its hands end in sharp talons, and its eyes glow with blue fire.","A bhuta is a ghostlike undead creature born of horrible death or murder in a natural setting. It is a manifestation of rage at the injustice of a death that interrupted important business or unsated desires. Doomed to haunt the wilderness within several miles of the site of its demise, a bhuta turns to the local fauna as tools for its vengeance. A bhuta can appear in a variety of animalistic forms by using its veil ability, but its natural appearance is that of a bestial humanoid phantom that floats a foot above the ground as it moves. While bhutas are incorporeal, the touch of their claws creates horrific, bleeding wounds. A bhuta's feet point backward. To disguise its nature, a bhuta can appear solid, manifesting in long robes that help disguise the fact that it floats and has strange feet. By means of its magic jar spell-like ability, a bhuta can also possess living animals to use as its minions; an animal possessed by a bhuta casts no shadow, and therefore prefers to lurk in heavily canopied or thicketed areas, waiting for the right time to strike out and attack intruders. Animals find themselves attracted to bhutas, which use their spell-like abilities to manipulate such victims toward evil and deceptive ends. Bhutas generally avoid inf luencing animal companions or domesticated animals, for changes in behavior among such creatures can easily arouse suspicion and reveal a bhuta's presence and inf luence. A bhuta might have tasks it wishes to complete from its previous existence as a living creature, or it might work against those who slew its living form. This link to its past life is vague and compulsive rather than clear, unlike that of a ghost. Bhutas who have no specific target for retribution still seek to trouble those living in or near their domains, coaxing passersby into accepting them as traveling companions and using their inf luence over animals as a testament to their benevolence. When invited to join a group, a bhuta can journey outside its normal territory. However, a bhuta's hunger for living blood usually drives it to attack its companions before it wanders far.",12800
Biclops,12,humanoid,temperate or warm mountains,At first glance this monstrosity appears to be a filthy ettin of huge size. On closer inspection the true nature of the creature is revealed as it has but one eye in the center of each ugly head.,"Despite their appearance biclops are generally peaceable creatures who live by hunting and herding giant longhorn sheep, which they keep for milk and wool. They are feared by less intelligent giants such as hills giants and trolls whom they beat to death on sight. Biclops have good relations with stone giants whom they trade finished metal weapons and goat cheese in exchange for raw ore and gold. Adult male biclops stand about 16 feet tall and weigh about 4,500 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Both male and female dress in clothes made of dark or dull colors . Biclops skin ranges from ruddy brown to cinnamon and eye color is usually blue. Hair color is almost universally dark though occasionally a fair-haired biclops is born . Warriors and protectors often wear hide armor  and always carry weapons. A biclops can live to be 350 years old. Biclops fight with twin longswords, hacking foes to pieces with mighty cleaving chops. If given advanced warning they tend to chase off intruders with well aimed rocks hurled from great heights or crushing them beneath controlled avalanches. Biclops live in tribe-like communities deep within hills and mountains constructing their homes from the stones and lumber of their environment. A typical biclops home has three rooms: a communal area where the family meets, a sleeping room, and a kitchen. Biclops families rely on each other for protection, food, and trade. External trade is often set up between biclops and other races, particularly stone giants and dwarves. Some of the less ""reputable"" tribes take prisoners or cannibalize humanoids and monstrous humanoids. In such a case, there is a 20% chance that a biclops lair contains 1d4 captive humanoids or monstrous humanoids. Biclops leaders are usually fighters or barbarians. Most groups of biclops include clerics . A biclops cleric has access to two of the following domains: Earth, Strength, Trickery, or War. Sorcerers and wizards are extremely rare among the biclops race. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",19200
Biloko,0.5,fey,warm forests,This gnome-sized humanoid's face is adorned with fiery red eyes and a sharp-toothed mouth that seems too wide for its head. The creature is garbed in leaves and possesses no hair-patches of grass and moss grow from its skin instead.,"Blood-red man-eaters and cunning junglesstalkers, biloko hunt those who think themselves hunters, preying upon foolish travelers and incautious junglesnatives with maniacal zeal. Lanky and quick humanoids, biloko possess exaggerated, fearfully expressive facial features, including mouths capable of stretching impossibly wide. Adept at blending in amid junglesunderbrush despite their brilliant coloration, these ferocious junglesfey delight in constructing deadly traps, tricking victims into deadly ambushes, and leading enthralled foes into dangerous situations. The average biloko stands between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 50 pounds, though a biloko who has recently fed might bear the weight of a far greater creature. Ecology Wild-eyed and unpredictable, biloko are feared by mnatives of the junglesand the tropical lands around their verdant hunting grounds. Frequent menaces in both the fireside tales of children and the bravest adults' nightmares, they embody the most common fears of the jungles, proving that beneath the junglescanopy lurk forces that seek to do the unwary harm and can make even experienced warriors disappear without a trace. Biloko exclusively consume humanoid meat, and though they tend to prowl near forests-side villages, prey can be sparse at times. A biloko can live without sustenance for a lengthy period, but the hunger it eventually suffers proves nearly maddening. Sometimes fasting for weeks at a time, the intense hunger pains a biloko feels may drive it to cannibalism, though such occurrences are somewhat rare. A biloko's mouth stretches across its face in a grotesque, unnatural fashion, and it can consume a whole humansized creature in one terrible, hours-long bite, dislocating its jaw like a snake in order to do so. With the aid of its acidic saliva, its powerful maw is capable of grinding flesh and bone into a concentrated, compact form, allowing it to digest and survive off of a single meal for the extended period of time it may be forced to fast while awaiting new prey. If uninterrupted, an eager, starving biloko can swallow an adult human in about 3 hours. Biloko are related to the junglesspriggans known as Eloko, though they are far less organized and more at home in the junglesdepths. While wilder and more bloodthirsty than their spriggan kin, biloko possess several similar physical traits, though their gaunt builds and bright red skins make the two unmistakably distinct. Some biloko look on their fey kin as strangely colored relatives, while other biloko attack them just as they would other stranger. Thus, little special connection exists between the two races. Eloko are further detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of the jungles. Habitat & Society Biloko are cruel, mischievous humanoids, known and feared by all who dare live near a forests plagued with the vile beings. Non-locals are urged never to travel alone; those foolish enough to ignore these warnings are seldom seen again. Whether hunting for food or journeying through the wilderness, locals know well to move in groups. While biloko are intelligent beings, their reclusive habits and lust for flesh drive them from sort of civilized society. They keep mostly to deep, dark areas of the forests, and are rarely seen on the woods' outskirts. Their numbers are small enough that it is rare for two unacquainted biloko to run into each other on a given day, but the species is sufficiently widespread to pose a threat to all travelers. Biloko are not social creatures by nature, but recognize the benefit of traveling in a group. When stealth is not of primary concern, several biloko might band together in order to hunt. While not organized by a tribal system, biloko often identify other biloko long residing in a region as friendly, although they remain cautious when encountering newcomers. They rarely see others of their kind as enemies, but more typically as rivals who begrudgingly allow one another to hunt on the same turf. Biloko rarely deal with other sentient beings-save during a meal. They choose lives of isolation from other races, usually dwelling within dark forests where their fiendish acts are less likely to be noticed by strangers. Large, hollow trees provide shelter for the small humanoids, who drape cloths of moss and ivy across the gaping portals behind which they slumber. A biloko often waits stealthily in his hideout, perched in one position for most of the day as he hungrily anticipates an unwary group of travelers or a lone wanderer. Once such a party or individual has passed, the monster creeps out of his hole, giving his prey a wide berth as he stalks it. At a time he deems appropriate-usually when a traveler is alone or has strayed from the group-the biloko whistles, creating an enchanting melody that draws his target near. The encounter ultimately ends in either the victim's hideous consumption or the biloko's flight. Far from being anchored to his hiding spot, a biloko often leaves his nook to wander the forests in search of other hiding spots on the edges of trails or well-trodden paths. Boring through a stump or the trunk of a tree with his razor-sharp claws, he can create a new abode in the span of several hours. A single biloko can have as mas a dozen hollow tree-holes, which provide valuable landmarks in the often complex jungles-maze he inhabits, as well as safety from pursuing predators or attackers. During his exploratory treks through the thick brush, a biloko might acquire dozens of fruits and berries for their bright colors, carrying the goods back to his nearest hiding hole to gaze upon later. Biloko have little interest in metals and artifacts, though they occasionally stumble upon a particular object they find especially attractive or interesting. They do, however, love gems, as the brightly colored crystals appear dazzling in the creatures' enhanced vision. This sense of sight, which makes anything not green in color stand out magnificently, helps biloko spot prey even in the thickest of jungles, where the skiesscraping canopy blots out the sun for miles.",200
Bison,4,animal,cold or temperate plains,"This creature has small, upward-pointing horns, a shaggy coat of fur, and a large hump on its shoulders.","Bison are large herd animals. They can grow as long as 12 feet and as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder. Average bison weigh 2,200 pounds. The bison's statistics can be used for almost larger herd animal, such as the buffalo. Bison frighten far less easily than their domesticated cousins and are much more aggressive when protecting the herd or their young. Adult bulls are extremely confontational in mating season, and even kill one another in pursuit of particular females. After mating season, herds of bison tend to separate into smaller herds in preparation for the arrival of new calves. Bison companions are identical to aurochs animal companions.",1200
Black Magga,15,outsider,the Storval Deep,This enormous creature's serpentine neck supports a leering reptilian head-its body is a wriggling mass of tentacles.,"Black Magga is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu and an embodiment of the goddess's reign over beasts, monsters, and madness. As an unholy auger of her will, Black Magga originally sought to confound the works of the civilized world, spread fear of monsters and the wilds, and direct Lamashtu's lesser servants in acts of depravity and bloodshed. Black Magga arrived in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded the immense quarry, and her presence in the newly formed lakes brought much misery and dread to the Thassilonians who dwelt on the lakes's shores or sailed its surface. Karzoug's interest in the region waned quickly, and he never bothered to take steps against the monster, prompting mto whisper that the runelord made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster in the Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great secret he had sunk beneath the waters. In event, it was said that the goddess spoke directly to Black Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were equal to the commands of Lamashtu herself. Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal until slain, she has spent mof the more than 10,000 years since she first came to Varisia in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect on Black Magga, for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed back during the height of Thassilon, before the advent of Earthfall changed everything. The Myth of Black Magga Fisherfolk and woodsmen who have ventured near the Storval Deep have long told tales of a fell monster rising from the depths. Below are a few commonly held but mistaken beliefs about Black Magga-although they may well have been true during the times of ancient Thassilon, when she was at the height of her power. BLOOD TONGUE: Mwho have seen Black Magga and lived can never speak of their experiences. Supposedly, when they attempt to tell the tale, black blood wells from their throats and into their mouths, choking their words. Thus, far fewer claim to have seen Black Magga than actually have. GOD-PROOF: Black Magga is older than mgods. Divine magic is said to have little effect whatsoever on her abominable form. Anyone who cuts Magga's black heart from her vile chest and bathes in its putrescent blood will likewise become invulnerable to the power of the gods. STORM BRINGER: Sightings of Black Magga often herald powerful storms and hurricanes. It is said that the beast summons these storms to pull victims into her watersy domain, whereupon she captures them, consumes them, and transforms them into monstrous, vermicular horrors. Mothers of Oblivion Lesser versions of Black Magga are said to dwell in deep lakes in other parts of the world. Known as Mothers of Oblivion, these creatures have the same basic statistics as Black Magga, except that they have only 10 Hit Dice and are Huge rather than Gargantuan. Monstrous creatures of chaos and madness, the abominable Mothers of Oblivion are said to have been created by the goddess of monsters to serve as mouthpieces and leaders among her savage minions. Some esoteric texts-sacrilegious even to Lamashtu's profane church-claim that the Mothers of Oblivion are actually sisters of Lamashtu, subjugated by the goddess, robbed of their divinity, and cast down to Golarion as her twisted servitors. Whatever their heritage, for uncounted centuries the Mothers of Oblivion have been among the favored servants of Lamashtu and throughout history have risen to mete out her unholy wrath. Rare in the extreme-and despite what the fearful mortal races call them-these monstrosities seem to have no ability to reproduce, though some whisper that a select few are capable of biting off their own tongues to produce strange, wormlike spawn. Mothers of Oblivion slink in the darkest, deepest reaches of the world, shunning the light of day as well as the gaze of insectlike mortals, who would gawk and abandon their pathetic minds at the merest glimpse of such unknowable horrors. The deepest reaches of oceans and the oldest lakes serve as redoubts for these forsaken queens of madness. From these depths, they sate themselves on sea creatures, the offerings of their servants, and the occasional unwary victim dragged screaming from the surface. They are careful to keep their presence secret from those of the world above. From the depths, Mothers of Oblivion form intricate hierarchies of servants and go-betweens, reaching their black tentacles through the societies of amphibious intermediaries into the demesnes of greater monstrosities and larger cities and civilizations alike.",51200
Black Orc,0.33,humanoid,temperate hills or mountains,This creature resembles a 7-foot tall orc with bluish-black skin and red eyes.,"Fully a head taller than an ordinary orc these foul brutes have been known to make other orcs cringe in fear. Unlike normal orcs, black orcs move in daylight as well as they do the darkness of their subterranean lairs . Black orcs were taken in early ages by Orcus the Demon Lord of Undead and bred with demonic blood in a matter that would accommodate his diabolical needs. Black orcs refer to their dark master as ""Old Man Death"". These orcs fairly worship death and display the death's head prominently upon their standards and devices. They are often found in the service of necromancers and move easily in mixed groups of zombies, skeletons, and even ghouls. Larger and more intelligent than their lesser kin, black orcs look down on other orc races as inferior to themselves. When forced to cooperate with other orc tribes in large forces black orcs consistently plot to overthrow the other tribe's chieftain and take command. This treachery is likely the reason there are so few bands of the black orc nation known to exist, as the infighting tends to keep their numbers down. Black orcs stand 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 280 pounds. Females tend to be about the same height, but are a bit lighter. Both males and females have blue-black skin with red eyes and more pronounced tusks than their smaller cousins. Black orcs have a decent understanding of tactics. They are adept in the use of reach weapons such as longspears and glaives. Mof their number are proficient in the use of light crossbows. In melee they prefer to gang up on powerful opponents and dispatch them quickly before moving on to lesser foes whenever possible. As they are often led by clerics and necromancers in the service of Orcus, they are likely to take prisoners if possible with the intent of sacrificing them to the Demon Lord of Undead at some future time. Black Orc Characters Black orc leaders tend to be clerics or barbarians. Black orc clerics worship Orcus. A black orc cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Death, Destruction, Evil, and War. Black orc clerics favor spells that deal damage or create undead. +8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma: Black orcs are brutal and savage. Darkvision: Black orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. AC: +1 natural armor bonus. Blessing of Orcus:  Ferocity DR 1/- Light Sensitivity Weapon Familiarity: Black orcs are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat weapon with the word ""orc"" in its name as a martial weapon. Languages: Black orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc. Black Orcs with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Abyssal, Dwarven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.",135
Black Pudding,7,ooze,underground,"This black, amorphous blob piles up on itself, a quivering mound of midnight sludge that glistens darkly before surging forward.","Black puddings are the scavengers of the underworld, constantly on the lookout for a meal. They can sense organic or metallic objects within 60 feet and mindlessly attack such items or beings until they are dissolved or the ooze is killed. A black pudding reproduces by breaking off a piece of its body and forming a new, smaller black pudding, which grows to full size in 1 month's time. Some of the more intelligent creatures in the underworld use black puddings as natural garbage disposals, creating stone pits to house the pudding and throwing organic refuse or foes in as needed. Larger specimens of black puddings have been encountered in the deepest parts of the world, with Gargantuan individuals having up to 30 HD. Other colored puddings are rumored to exist, with white ones living in the arctic, brown ones living in swamps, and tan ones living in deserts.",2400

Black Skeleton,5,undead,underground,"This creature looks like a skeleton with glistening black bones, seemingly constructed of blackened steel. Small red pinpoints of light burn in its hollowed eye sockets.","Black skeletons were first encountered in Rappan Athuk . Much more powerful than standard skeletons, these minions of evil are often employed as guardians or protectors to keep sealed some ancient knowledge best left undiscovered. They are intelligent monsters and are not subject to the mindless commands that can be given to such undead as skeletons or zombies. They have a clear mind, and sometimes go against the commands and wishes of those they serve, if it benefits the black skeleton in question. Black skeletons are the remnants of living creatures slain in an area where the ground is soaked through with evil. The bodies of fallen heroes are contaminated and polluted by such evil and within days after their death, the slain creatures rise as black skeletons, leaving their former lives and bodies behind. Black skeletons are intelligent and do maintain some memories of their former lives. Black skeletons wear clothes or armor they had in life, and some still carry their gear or weapons . Black skeletons attack with two short swords in battle with little more than the intention of cutting their foes to pieces. They are intelligent opponents and will use tactics during battle, often sending several of their number against a foe's front, while the others move into position to flank their adversaries. Black skeletons are smart enough to know when the battle is lost and withdraw from combat, though rarely. Most simply fight to the death, driven by some unseen hatred for the living.

Black Spot,0.5,magical beast,temperate or warm oceans or coastlines,"The spines of this sizable sea urchin bristle, revealing a strange, multipart beak gnashing in their midst.","Though not actually intelligent, black spots are terrifyingly adept at locating prey and potential threats, leaping forth from tide pools in great bounds to skewer their victims. However, the true danger of a black spot urchin comes not from its gnashing, star-shaped beak or its needle-pointed spines, but rather from its weird magical nature. Instead of simply poisoning those it punctures, a black spot urchin in fact curses them, inhibiting their ability to swim. How exactly black spots came by such a strange ability and what they gain from drowning their victims days or even years after first encountering them are anyone's guess, but sailors stung by one of the beasts often refuse to go to sea again for fear of their lives. A black spot urchin is typically several feet in diameter, but is mostly made of its long spines and so weighs only a few pounds.",200
Blackraven Scout,5,humanoid,any,"This tall, silent man wears a magnificent cloak of raven's feathers and a well-maintained suit of dark leather armor.","The Blackravens are an elite band of soldiers and scouts who guard the eastern borders of the Linnorm Kingdoms against incursions from Irrisen and other threats, such as frost giants from the Stormspear mountains and bands of ogres from the foothills that border the Nolands of Varisia. Freyr Darkwine, the castellan of Hagreach, leads the Blackravens, whose main headquarters is a granite fortress called Blackraven Hall, situated next to the Rimef low rivers near the border with Irrisen. While the Blackravens count among their number a wide range of individuals from varying races and classes, those most commonly encountered are scouts that patrol the rivers and roads throughout this borderland. These scouts undergo specific training against their hated enemies, and are all rangers specialized in fighting in subarctic conditions. A typical Blackraven patrol contains four to six members. In the open terrain around the Rimef low rivers, Blackraven patrols are sometimes mounted on horseback, but in less hospitable places they sometimes use dog sleds, skis, or snowshoes. They patrol the border regularly but in no set pattern, making it difficult to predict their movements. A Blackraven dons pale leather armor when he needs to blend into snowy environs, or when on reconnaissance missions into Irrisen. Blackraven scouts make extensive use of animal messenger spells to maintain communication over large areas. Specialists at battling trolls, Blackravens typically carry flaming arrows and alchemical fire to inhibit the creatures' regeneration and destroy their remains.",1600
Blighted Fey,6,fey,temperate forests,Ropes of fungus and patches of sickly mold cover this wan satyr.,"The forests of Fangwood dominates the nation of Nirmathas. The country depends on the mighty wood for its security and economy, yet in its thick and shadowy depths lurks an oppressive curse. Where the pine trees grow tall and thick, the dryad Arlantia reigns. A pawn of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug, she is infected by the insidious tendrils of the Prince of the Blasted Heath. A magical breach forged by this curse connects the demon lord's realm, the Jeharlu, to Golarion and to the First World itself. Arlantia infects trees with demonic ichor that warps the fey creatures who reside in the heart of Fangwood, and she takes advantage of the conflict and war that wracks Nirmathas to create an army of thorn-crowned daughters and other rot-infested horrors to consume the forests from within. The blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that moves and sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are by far the most insidious of the corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace- and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat every infected tree as if it were their own bonded tree. Only magic such as miracle, limited wish, or wish can sever the connection to the Jeharlu and cure a blighted fey. Some speculate that a magical linchpin exists within Fangwood, which if destroyed would end this hideous plague. CREATING A BLIGHTED FEY ""Blighted fey"" is an acquired template that can be added to fey creature with 2 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. Blighted fey were once normal fey-a fey creature tied up and bound in the ropey vines of the blighted, tainted trees of the Fangwood acquires the blighted fey template by the next sunset. A blighted fey uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Chaotic evil. Senses: A blighted fey gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if the base creature did not already have it. If the base creature already has darkvision, the ability is extended by an additional 30 feet. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2. Hit Dice: The base creature's racial Hit Dice change to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. Defensive Abilities: A blighted fey gains DR 10/cold iron and good; immunity to disease, paralysis, poison, and polymorph; and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10. A blighted fey also gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its newly adjusted CR. A blighted fey also gains the following ability. Fungal Rejuvenation : So long as it remains within 300 yards of blighted tree within the Fangwood and remains standing on moist earth, the blighted fey gains fast healing 5. The infected tree need not be specifically bonded to the blighted fey for this ability to function. Special Attacks: A blighted fey gains the following special attacks. Unless otherwise noted, save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the blighted fey's Hit Dice + the blighted fey's Constitution modifier. Parasitic Bond : Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack, the blighted fey can transform the thorn into a burrowing, wiggling maggot that infests the target and infuses it with a short-term curse from within unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. This parasite creates an unholy link to the target, binding it to the blighted fey. This binding persists for 5 rounds, during which all hit point damage taken by the blighted fey is halved, and the target takes the other half of the damage dealt. The type of damage remains consistent with what the blighted fey receives. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one creature at a time. This bond counts as a curse and a disease. Thorn Throw : A blighted fey can shoot a fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a standard action. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a sting natural attack, with damage based on the blighted fey's size , except the attack is resolved as a ranged attack instead of a melee attack. Special Qualities: A blighted fey gains the following special qualities. Cyth-V'sug's Unity : Blighted fey within 100 feet of each other can communicate through a shared fungal hive mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each other's senses, but they can share specific situational information and tactics through telepathy. If one blighted fey within range is aware of danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be surprised. Daughters of Arlantia : Fey creatures with close ties to a specific plant react differently to the blighted fey template. Blighted fey dryads are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A dryad's tree dependent special ability is modified  so blighted fey dryads are required only to remain within 300 yards of blighted Fangwood tree. This ability applies to blighted fey dryads only. Tainted Blood : A blighted fey's blood and flesh are rife with disease. Any creature that successfully makes a bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the creature must succeed at a second save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. Ability Scores: Str +4, Con +4, +2 Cha. Feats: Blighted fey gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Skills: A blighted fey gains a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge , Perception, and Stealth checks.",2400
Blightspawn of Ghlaunder,5,aberration,swamps,"This human-sized, mosquitolike creature has a long, flexible proboscis that ends in a murderous stinger.","The blightspawn of Ghlaunder are found most often in places where the Gossamer King's cult is strong, for these creatures must gestate in the body of one of the parasite god's true believers. To the faithful of Ghlaunder, being host to an immature blightspawn is a great honor, for when the monster bursts from the body of its host, the host's consciousness lives on in some way in the blightspawn's mind, almost as if the host had reincarnated into the monster. That cultists who die giving hideous birth to a blightspawn cannot be resurrected lends a bit of weight to this notion, even if the blightspawn themselves have nothing to say on the topic. A cultist carrying an immature blightspawn functions normally in all ways until the creature emerges -except that until then, the cultist can pass on new blightspawn to his or her children. A blightspawn's gestation can last for decades, and in cases in which a child is separated from infected parents, the child might live her entire life without knowing the truth of what awaits her upon death. When a blightspawn emerges from its host, it is immediately fully grown, although its gore-wet wings cannot be used for flight for 1d4 rounds after emerging.",1600

Blink Dog,2,magical beast,temperate plains or forests,"This sleek canine has a coarse, tawny coat, pointed ears, and pale eyes. A faint blue nimbus seems to dance upon its fur.","Though they resemble sleek, long-eared canines, blink dogs are as smart as humans. As social creatures, blink dogs travel in large packs, roaming forests and plains, running off evil creatures, and hunting for phase spiders- one of their natural enemies. Despite their intelligence and friendly natures, blink dogs tend to avoid humanoids, keeping their packs either hidden or frequently on the move. This shyness doesn't keep the blink dogs from helping out when needed, however, and they have been known to come to the rescue of a prairie village in their territory. Packs are typically led by an older, experienced male or female, called an alpha. Blink dogs are fiercely loyal, defending their own pack or creatures they befriend to the death, and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Honor is paramount to blink dogs, and different packs often have unique traditions  in addition to those shared by most blink dogs. Blink dogs have a great interest in the stars and movements of celestial bodies. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for constellations, and through this zodiac they note the seasons, births under auspicious stars, and omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. Blink dog names often contain a reference to a specific constellation under which the dog was born. Blink dogs stand nearly 3 feet at the shoulder and weigh upward of 180 pounds. They can live up to 75 years. They use their abilities to quickly surround prey, and make use of flanking to deal with especially dangerous opponents-particularly creatures like phase spiders. Blink Dog Sages A pack's alpha selects the wisest and most intelligent member of the pack to serve as its sage. This blink dog often has sorcerer levels  and is charged with maintaining the long-running oral histories of the pack, which extend back for centuries and link the packs together. A blink dog sage also decides when a pup is old enough to join his first hunt, performs birth and burial rites, and counsels the alpha on the meaning of omens or upon tactical matters involving interactions with neighboring races and creatures. In some packs, the sage is the alpha's mate, while in others the sage is always a gray-muzzled elder hound beyond breeding age.",600
Blodeuwedd,6,fey,temperate plains,"Clothed in verdant lichen and flowers of broom, meadowsweet, and oak, this shapely maiden has skin of velvety moss and living grass for hair. An eldritch serenity graces her countenance as she approaches, her outstretched, root-like hands brushing the tips of the tallest grass-the wind itself whispers around her feet as patches of clover, heather, and milkweed mark her every step.","The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forests, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years. Ecology Instead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads, blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear elven or human. Every 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300 yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the withering death of the would-be father. Such legends give blodeuwedds a reputation for being dangerous seductresses in some regions. Blodeuwedds typically establish their own prairie holdings within 7 miles of each other for mutual support and ease of communication. Habitat & Society Blodeuwedds make their homes out of sod, carving them from the landscape and then encouraging prairie grass to grow over the exterior to hide them. These elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillsocks that overlook ley lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles meant to curry their favor. As a result, mblodeuwedds set themselves up as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through their realms. Blodeuwedds also rely on plant growth and their ability to speak with plants to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their territory. Often they use hallucinatory terrain to hide the best routes through these areas. Interlopers typically find themselves impeded by entangle or areas of spike growth when they enter a blodeuwedd's territory. Any who persist then become targeted by deep slumber or modify memory to lead them in false directions. More rarely, a blodeuwedd might aid one on an important quest, but she usually requires some form of guarantee before agreeing to do so. All blodeuwedds possess tremendous knowledge of and influence over the lands and creatures that border their fields. They often involve themselves in the politics of elves, gnomes, and humans who live nearby-even if only to warn against destructive trespasses or wasteful farming practices. They enjoy playing wind flutes, dancing under the stars, and chasing one another's fairy lights like fireflies among the tall grass. Blodeuwedd Queens Particularly old and active blodeuwedds- typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens. • 9 Hit Dice • +2 natural armor • +4 Strength, +6 Constitution, +6 Charisma • Additional Spell-Like Abilities : Always active-endure elements, nondetection; At will- create waters, detect animals or plants; 3/day-command plants, move earth, summon nature's ally IV; 1/ day-fire seeds, plant shape II.

Blood Bush,4,plant,temperate forests,"This creature appears as a 3-foot tall flowering bush with a thick trunk and small whip-like branches. Each branch is topped with a blood-red flower and deep, rich green leaves.","The blood bush is a fell plant creature cursed by a wizard in times past. It is named for its blood-red flowers and its thorny blood-red seeds. A blood bush is sometimes referred to as a ""grave marker plant"" because a creature that encounters it, and fails to see the danger this sinister plant presents, rarely lives to tell about it. A blood bush can only be grown from a seed that has germinated inside the warm body of a Small or larger animal. Roots from the germinating seed kill the host and use the nutrients provided to grow rapidly into a deadly plant. A number of nobles use this horrid plant as a deterrent against thieves and robbers, sometimes creating entire hedges of these plants. A blood bush appears as a flowering bush about 3 feet tall. Its thick trunk quickly splits off into msmaller, whip-like branches, each topped with a blood-red flower surrounded by deep green leaves. Blood bush seeds can be sold for about 20 gp each on the open market; collecting them and living to earn the money they bring is not the easiest of tasks. When a blood bush detects a warm-blooded creature within 20 feet, it fires a volley of flower darts at the creature, attempting to implant it with its seeds. A creature that dies from the blood bush's seed implantation rapidly decomposes, and a new blood bush springs up in the area within four days. Living creatures within 5 feet of a blood bush are slashed and cut with its four whip-like tendrils. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Lance Hawvermale.",1200

Blood orcs always fight to the death, take few prisoners, and offer no quarter to their foes. Blood orcs have a special hatred for black orcs whom they see as traitors to the orcish god Grotaag. A typical male blood orc stands over 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds or more. Females tend to be slightly lighter and smaller. Blood orcs skin is dark reddish-black and their hair is black, dark brown, or crimson . Eye color is always black. Blood orcs favor armor and clothes of black or dark red. Skilled in combat, blood orcs are ruthless opponents, attacking with weapons and savage bite. They swarm foes and are known for assaulting the center of enemy forces, overbearing defenders with their brutal attacks. Their most common tactic is to form a shield wall with heavy wooden shields. The front rows of attackers break enemy lines with battleaxes while the rear ranks attack with longspears and glaives. Once melee is mixed and blood is in the air, the blood orcs drop both in favor of greataxes. When faced with magic-using opponents they spread themselves out to avoid being consumed by area of effect spells. Blood Orc Society Blood orcs are a primitive , barbaric race of people. Hunters and nomads by nature, they rarely settle in one place for long being always on the move following source of food. Blood orc tribes and villages tend to congregate near one another for protection, food, and various other needs. Most tribes or villages also situate themselves near an abundant source of waters. Other orc tribes avoid the blood orc nations, seeing them as savages and primitives. Trade between the blood orcs and other races is rare though blood orcs do tend to favor the compof gnolls, flinds, and hobgoblins . Each tribe or village is let by an elder warrior, a barbarian of great strength and power. Each tribe also includes at least a single shaman or witch doctor who tends to the wounded, predicts the future, and so on. Blood Orc Characters Blood orc leaders tend to be barbarians. Blood orcs pay homage to Grotaag.

Blood Pudding,5,ooze,temperate marshes or underground,A three-foot-tall spheroid blob of blood-red protoplasm seeps a foul smelling and sticky slime.,"This monster rolls through dark corridors or marshes looking for sustenance and can consume the vital fluids of creature it contacts. This sustenance most often takes the form of dungeon delvers that stumble upon the pudding. In marshes and swamps, the blood pudding feeds on animals and other natural fauna or other living creature that happens to wander by. A blood pudding strikes by forming a thick pseudopod and lashing out at an opponent. If it hits, it attempts to grab that foe and infuse itself with the opponent's body. Unless forcibly removed from the victim, a blood pudding does not relinquish its host until that creature is dead. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Blood Queen,23,outsider,any,"This hideous monstrosity looks like an enormous curled maggot, varicolored like deeply bruised flesh. Three flailing tentacles adorn each side of the thing's huge, pulsating mouth, and five more arch from its hindquarters.","Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today, convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular sacrificial victims and offerings of blood. The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se-rather, what look like angry pustules all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to manipulate objects and electrify victims. The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral. While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too large to fit through of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder at the prospect. Kuru Surrogates The Blood Queen's favored deacons are known as kuru surrogates, and such monstrosities are created when the horror digests a creature and entombs the victim in one of its paralytic sacs for long enough. The creature that emerges is essentially brain-dead, having been completely stripped of its wits and nervous system. A kuru surrogate remains in its vegetative state until it starves, is killed, or is affected by a heal spell or a similar effect of equal or greater power. Kuru surrogates are revered among the Blood Queen's devout, who transport the immobile things around the Cannibal Isles, perpetually caring for the ""blessed"" individuals. The Blood Queen acts through these surrogates and uses them to augment and command its kuru followers, linking with its minions in order to capture who oppose it or its wicked cult of cannibals.",819200
Blood Reaver Devil,8,outsider,any,"This tall reddish-bronze colored humanoid has leathery flesh and gleaming, gold eyes. Its hands end in blood-stained claws, and a long snake-like and forked tail trails behind it. The smell of fresh blood hangs in the air. It wields a wicked dual-headed flail.","Blood reavers, also known as garugins, are dangerous and vile creatures that stalk the Hells searching for mortal plane jumpers. They believe no living mortal has the right to step into Hell; the only mortals that should be in Hell are the ones whose souls are corrupted in the afterlife or evil mortals that deserve to be there through actions and sins committed while still alive. All other mortals are trespassers and should be dealt with accordingly. Blood reavers have a neutral relationship with most other devils; they can take them or leave them. They do seem to have a good rapport with bone devils, perhaps because the wicked bone devil is just as evil and corrupt as they are or perhaps because the bone devil shows no mercy when dispatching an enemy. A blood reaver stands 8 feet tall and is never without its special barbed dire flail. The heads are wickedly crafted with oversized and strongly curved barbs so they do as much tissue damage as possible when they hit. Blood reavers despise mortals and attack them on sight. They prefer to hide or stand nearby while invisible and let their siphoning aura drain a person of its blood, though the telltale sign that something is wrong is when the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth begin to bleed for no apparent reason. In combat, they attack with their barbed flails, relentlessly hammering away at their enemies and freely unloading with walls of fire to separate allies from one another. Being immune to fire, the blood reaver simply walks through the wall and attacks the creature standing on the other side. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800

Though classified as a weird, its plane of origin is unknown. Does there exist somewhere within the great configuration of inner and outer planes a plane composed entirely of blood? Some say yes. Others doubt it. Whatever the truth, sage cannot argue the existence of the creature known as a blood weird. Blood weirds are virtually unknown and so are rarely encountered outside their native plane. When summoned to the Material Plane, great care must be taken, for these creatures cannot exist without a large source of blood. Before summoning this creature, casters often fill a large basin or font with the blood of slain foes or captives. Blood weirds wait patiently in their pool for potential prey.

Its clothes hang in rags and are soaked in blood as well. Its hands end in sharpened claws and its eyes display no signs of life.,"When a living creature bleeds to death on unholy ground, its corpse sometimes returns to life as a blood wight. Evil priests of Orcus, Jubilex, Lucifer and various other demon princes and devil lords often hold dark rituals where they bleed a living creature to death in order to create a blood wight. Blood wights generally detest living creatures, but if created by a clerical or necromantic ritual, the created blood wight will not harm its creator . Blood wights are solitary creatures though occasionally more than one of these creatures is encountered . A blood wight stands 8 to 10 feet tall and weighs 400 to 550 pounds. It appears much as it did in life but its body constantly weeps and oozes blood, even leaving footprints as it moves across the ground. Blood wights that could speak in life retain the knowledge of all languages they knew, but for the most part blood wights do not communicate either with others of their kind or with living creatures . A blood wight enters combat slashing with its claws. Given a chance, it grabs the closest opponent and engulfs it, holding it inside its body until it drowns. Drowned foes are ejected from the blood wight's body into a heap on the ground . A blood wight's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Bloodhaze Mosquito Swarm,6,vermin,warm forests or swamps,"A high-pitched whine issues forth from the haze of this surging crimson cloud. Within, thousands of tiny forms whir in agitation, each a tiny insect with a needle-like proboscis.","Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to junglesinterior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control. A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other junglesinhabitants to the swarm's presence. Ecology Bloodhaze mosquitoes always sate themselves on the blood of other animals, using their darkvision and ability to detect pheromones to track prey. They typically lie in wait near waters sources where they can both breed and feed on animals that come to drink. Warm-blooded creatures draw their attention more quickly than amphibians or reptiles, though even lizards, snakes, and frogs become food sources during leaner times. Not only does blood provide sustenance to bloodhaze mosquitoes, but the females actually require it to reach egg-laying maturity. Females must also have waters in which to lay their eggs, though even a sewage-filled mud puddle will suffice. A single female mosquito can lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch into larvae after 2 days. Mof these eggs suffer the predation of fish and other waters scavengers during this time of vulnerability. The surviving eggs hatch, releasing larvae that molt and shed their skins while feeding on organic matter and microorganisms in the waters. Then they enter a pupal stage, conserving energy as they undergo a final transformation before finally emerging as fully grown adults. The entire hatching and growth process takes less than a single week. After reaching maturity, bloodhaze mosquitoes swiftly take to the air, naturally drawn to one another through their pheromones and banding together in swarms strong enough to challenge animal for territorial supremacy. The life of a typical bloodhaze mosquito spans only 3 months. They spend that time ravenously feeding in their swarms, consuming enough blood that their females can continue laying eggs. The mosquitoes possess no maternal or protective instincts, however, quickly abandoning their progeny before dying out to be replaced by them. Habitat & Society Bloodhaze mosquitoes live in tropical wetlands, only venturing farther away when hunting becomes scarce or high winds carry them into other regions. Unintelligent predators, the mosquitoes give off pheromones to maintain their swarm's cohesion. Specific scent markers for distress, mating, and food rule most of their behavior. Powerful, false odors or thick and pungent smoke can sometimes mask or disrupt this communication, as can immersion in waters, leading to traditions among mnative peoples of coating themselves in sulphurous mud or burning reeking torches during the height of the mosquitoes' feeding seasons. Although bloodhaze mosquitoes don't feed on other insects, they do prove highly territorial. While swarming, a group of the mosquitoes will attack and kill other insects they encounter. Such ferocity can wipe out whole hives or nests of insectile junglesinhabitants, potentially having farther-reaching ramifications for other creatures speedy or canny enough to escape the swarms. In more dramatic instances, swarms might fell massive junglesinsects or the populations of whole areas, leaving trails of crunching insectile corpses to mark their path. Mwangi Menaces Deadly beasts, trackless wildernesses, and violent storms typify most explorers' visions of travel through the Mwangi Expanse. Yet however real and deadly such perils may be, they are hardly the only threats travelers through these lands face. Diseases, vermin, parasites, rot, and uncountable other hazards unite in an endless assault against those who intrude upon these wild lands. Maladies like the sleeping sickness carried by bloodhaze mosquito swarms and other insects present just one such danger. While the following details present that disease, GMs who seek to make their tropical travels feel distinct from adventures elsewhere on Golarion should check out Chapter 1 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of the junglesfor details on junglesmaladies and other threats. Sleeping Sickness Endemic throughout the Sodden Lands and the Mwangi Expanse, the parasitic aff liction known as ""sleeping sickness"" is spread when flying insects inject tiny parasites into their unsuspecting victim's bloodstream, thus inducing fever, headache, joint pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia. While exceedingly dangerous, even when administered by a practiced healer, the best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic . If the patient survives, there's a cumulative 30% chance per dose that the disease is immediately cured.

Bloodsuckle,6,plant,temperate forests,"This is a nightmarish plant consisting of a bulbous root and several vine-like tendrils, each ending in hollow, needle-like points. Woody limbs as thick as a human's leg sprout from the trunk. Its leaves are a vile greenish color, and constantly drip a sticky, foul-smelling sap.","Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent and immobile plants that gain nourishment from the blood of living creatures. Unlike other carnivorous plants, the bloodsuckle maintains a group of living hosts that it gorges itself on. Bloodsuckles are found in forests, swamps, and rolling hills in climates where the temperate is mild. They are never found in cold climates, but a variety of this plant is thought to exist in warmer regions. When a bloodsuckle detects movement within 30 feet, it sends out its long, vine-like tendrils towards the disturbance. If the tendril strikes a living target, it injects sap into the victim which brings it under the plant's control. A bloodsuckle can automatically detect the presence of one of its hosts within 30 feet, and does not attack it. Rather, it lets the host draw close so it can embrace it with its tendrils and consume its blood. Creatures that are not hosts of the bloodsuckle that come within 10 feet are attacked by its woody limbs. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",2400

Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of waters indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control.

Changed into a twisted, misanthropic husk, a bodak wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals or otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories of its former existence, the bodak is driven by profound emptiness, sorrowful longing, and vengeful hatred of all life. A bodak's appearance is profoundly disturbing. Its flesh looks dried, taut, and desiccated, though it possesses a strange, otherworldly sheen. Its body is disproportionate and distinctly androgynous. Hairless and with only vague hints of facial structure, the bodak's eyes are deep set in their sockets and constantly weep foul-smelling smoky vapors. A planes-wise traveler who recognizes its shape knows to flee, for most travelers can outrun the relatively slow bodak. Bodaks vehemently despise all living creatures and immediately seek to destroy they encounter. A bodak retains the ability to speak one language it knew in life , but it rarely engages in conversation, instead spitting out an incomprehensible stream of vile accusations, curses, and threats. On occasion, a bodak might wield weapons, but most rely primarily upon the effects of their deadly gaze. Bodaks are rarely encountered outside of the Abyss. As they are slow-witted, powerful evil creatures such as liches and nabasu demons sometimes use bodaks as thralls, assassins, or guardians.

Bog Strider,2,monstrous humanoid,temperate or warm swamps,"A narrow, beetle-like creature glides across the waters's dark surface on four brown, spindly legs. It stands just over five feet tall, holding its head and thorax upright while clutching an intricately carved hunting spear in two clawed forelimbs. Powerful mandibles click in rhythm with the reed-thin antennae waving upon its head as if testing the air for the scent of prey.","Bog striders call themselves Ses'h in Aquan, but the first explorers to encounter them named the reclusive bug-men after their ability to stride on waters like solid ground. Individual bog striders resemble upright beetles with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. They depend on their watersborne speed to quickly chase down prey and flee from predators. Otherwise, they care little for civilizations other than their own, rarely venturing from the swampsy rivers and lakes they call home. The long, spindly legs of bog striders give the impression of a greater size then their relatively fragile frames actually account for. Although their limbs are in most cases more than double, even triple, the length of other humanoids, their inflexible joints grant them little more mobility, range of motion, and capability to reach than others. Regardless of gender, nearly all bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology Bog striders reproduce during specific seasonal and astrological cycles that occur only two to three times during their entire lifespan-detecting their moment of peak fertility through changes in the weather and tidal effects upon large bodies of waters. Thereafter, pregnant females lay a clutch of four to 10 eggs, keeping them submerged and guarding against predators until they hatch 6 months later. The younglings then cling to their mother for the next 3 months as they learn the rudiments of survival and socialization within the tribe. Unfortunately, predators  often view bog strider eggs and younglings as easy prey. Hatcheries suffer attacks by crocodiles and giant frogs, while birds of prey, boggards, and human hunters pick off younglings who stray from their mothers on the open waters. As a result of these reproductive challenges, bog striders struggle to keep pace with other swamps-dwelling cultures, suffering through periods of decline and nearextinction. These difficulties make them increasingly insular and territorial, meeting interlopers with spears more often than diplomacy. A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat. They routinely hunt for fish, crustaceans, or snakes, and occasionally hunt for birds, giant wasps, or dragonflies. They particularly excel at spearfishing and snaring airborne prey with thrown nets. The wide stance of a bog strider's four legs displaces its weight over body of waters by maintaining the surface tension with a cushion of air trapped beneath several small ridges on each foot. While not dissimilar to the motion of minute waters-striding insects, for bog striders the motion is aided by some manner of innate magic or other supernatural relationship with the waters. Regardless of the source of this ability, it allows them to literally walk on waters, though they can also fully submerge and hide below the surface if they desire. Bog striders who survive into adulthood can live up to 60 years. Each youngling develops a varied pattern of mottled gray and brown coloration across its carapace, uniquely distinguishing it from others. These spots tend to fade as bog striders age, causing their elders to all look much alike. Habitat & Societ y Bog striders can survive in all but the coldest of climes, living their entire lives on the rivers, lakes, and bogs where they make their homes. Their society focuses primarily on survival due to the depredations of natural predators and wars with lizardfolk and boggards. Each member of a bog strider tribe, both male and female, learns to defend the tribe at the earliest possible age. In addition, everyone must develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of their species. Females serve as the builders of bog strider society. They weave large mats of reeds, rushes, and netting that they coat in watersproof tree sap to trap pockets of air below the waters's surface where they can safely build and hide their villages. When not looking after their young, the females continuously expand or replace flooded sections of these communities. Meanwhile, male bog striders act as hunters and gatherers, bringing back enough food to last through harsh winters and times of drought. They also scout the watersways for threats to their community, leaving those who pass through their territory unmolested but fighting off those who attempt to stay or exploit the same resources they depend upon. Frequently small bands also venture far from their native lands, seeking to find new, uninhabited watersways where their imperiled communities might be left in peace. Seer-queens rule over multiple bog strider communities to form secluded tribal unions, acting as religious leaders and reading the rivers currents or tides to divine the will of Gozreh. Mbecome clerics or druids worshiping the nature god in its feminine form, though they interpret Gozreh more as a great body of waters than a likeness of themselves.

"Bogeyman, minor",6,undead,any,This creature resembles a man-sized translucent humanoid with delicate features not unlike those of a child. It wears flowing robes tied at the waist with a sash made of the same incorporeal stuff it is. The creature's face shows no emotion.,"Bogeymen are the stuff of legends: creatures created in the minds of parents who relayed stories about incorporeal ghosts coming to carry their children off if they didn't go to bed when they were supposed to, didn't do their chores when asked, and so on. The apparitional bogeyman's ties to the land of the living are a result of these stories. By their very nature, bogeymen are not evil. They derive more pleasure from tormenting and harassing an opponent rather than outright killing it. Generally if a bogeyman reduces a living creature to a comatose state  it leaves it where it falls. Bogeymen feed off the fear and madness induced in living creatures rather than their blood, life force, or flesh. A bogeyman stands about 6 feet tall and appears as an incorporeal humanoid with a child-like countenance and delicate features. It robes and sash seem to constantly billow and blow as if by some unseen breeze. A bogeyman rarely confronts a party of adventurers, preferring to attack a lone individual when it is most vulnerable. Bogeymen always attack at night; none have ever been encountered during daylight hours. A bogeyman that fancies a creature may stalk that being for days, torturing it with its bump in the night ability before finally driving the victim completely mad.

Bogeyman,10,fey,any,"Dressed in a long dark coat and a tall hat, this lanky, fanged humanoid exudes an almost palpable aura of horror.","Many believe that the most cruel and mischievous fey become bogeymen as a punishment or a reward for their actions. Others see bogeymen as supernatural manifestations of society's willingness to do itself harm. Bogeymen use their powers to haunt houses or secluded natural places where they can hunt prey unobserved. They relish using their ghost sound ability to hint at their presence long before they fully reveal themselves. It is not uncommon for a bogeyman to hide under a bed, or in a closet left slightly ajar, for days or even weeks, all the while feeding on its victims' growing realization that they are not alone. The most evil bogeymen are those who abandon the tactic of feeding on one person's fears at a time and take up roles of mass murderers or serial killers, or other pursuits designed to drive fear into the hearts of an entire city of victims. True to their name, all bogeymen are male. Sometimes, children whom they steal away to secret lairs emerge years later, transformed into new bogeymen, and return home to continue their supernatural father's work.",9600
Boggard,2,humanoid,temperate marshes,Bulbous eyes glare atop this creature's decidedly toad-like head. A multitude of warts and bumps decorate its greenish skin.,"Boggards resemble anthropomorphic frogs or toads, complete with webbed hands and feet, large eyes, and overly wide mouths. These creatures make their homes near large rivers or deep in marshes. There they make small villages composed of mud mounds on the banks. Boggards start out life as tadpoles in breeding ponds, eventually growing to a length of 3 feet before sprouting arms and legs and becoming capable of terrestrial living. Acceptance into the clan then depends on the young boggard's successful hunt to kill a sentient humanoid. Those who fail are exiled from the clan. As boggards age, they continue to grow and lose their coloration. Exceptionally old boggards bear completely white skin covering massive corpulent bodies. Some of these boggards rank among the caste of priest-kings and enjoy a life of grotesque pleasures ruling their clans. Though often hunched over, boggards stand 5 feet tall and weigh close to 200 pounds. These creatures live for 50 years, though the harsh swamps and infighting usually cut these years short.",600
Boggart,5,aberration,marshes,"This creature resembles a small, rough-looking humanoid with unkempt dark hair, an untrimmed shaggy beard and thick mustache. Its skin is pale and its eyes are green. Its body is covered in coarse, dark fur.","The boggart is a relative of the will-o-wisp. Sages believe it to be a sort of ""larval"" or immature form of said creature. It haunts mof the same places as its adult form and can be just as deadly when encountered. The typical boggart stands 2 feet tall. A boggart begins melee using its confusion ability. It then uses its electrical attack against its foes while changing forms as it wishes. Foes not in melee range are subjected to its electrical discharge attack .

Bogwid,5,aberration,swamps or underground,"This nightmare shambles along the ground on eight muscular tentacles that leave behind a clear viscous residue stinking of putrefaction. Its amphibian skin is moist, green-black, and covered in warts and protuberances. On its back, dozens of fist-sized pustules shift and pulsate with nauseating vitality, like sentient oily bubbles threatening to burst.","Aberrant beasts of ancient origin, bogwids are loathsome, skulking predators that inhabit the gloomy swamps and damp subterranean places of the world. Looking like a bloated, eight-limbed, greenish-black mix of frog and tentacled beast, this asexual creature is most notorious for the larvae it carries on its back. Ecology Some scholars suggest the large, muscular body of the bogwid serves as little more than transport for its ravenous young-30 to 40 fist-sized, pustule-like protuberances that cling to its back, inf lating and def lating, shifting and quivering with disturbing vitality. The bogwid attacks with two of its undulating tentacles, the bottoms of which are lined with ragged, bony ridges that can tear hungrily into exposed flesh. However, the more disturbing danger is those pulsating orbs of flesh on its back: larvae that are capable of launching themselves as far as 10 feet and attaching to creatures with their fanged sucker mouths. Once one of these disgusting things sinks its jagged teeth into flesh, it begins sucking blood and does not release its grip until it or the target is dead. When a bogwid makes a kill, several of its young jump upon the warm carcass and feed greedily. If the victim is a Medium or larger creature, these rapacious larvae fight for the opportunity to burrow into the corpse. Over the course of 2 weeks, the burrowed creatures gestate, and the cadaver bloats until an adolescent bogwid  gruesomely bursts forth. The larger the kill, the more of the bogwid's young can burrow in and hatch out as adolescents; a Large victim can accommodate two larvae, a Huge victim four larvae, a Gargantuan victim eight larvae, and a Colossal victim 16 larvae. A creature smaller than Medium doesn't possess sufficient nutrition for bogwid larvae to gestate properly. As a result, adult bogwids tend to completely consume smaller kills instead of leaving them for the larvae. Bogwids that inhabit seaside haunts are not averse to eating carrion. Indeed, a sizable sea creature whose carcass washes ashore  is usually set upon by a nearby bogwid, whose ravenous larvae tunnel their way into the rotting flesh, and several days later erupt like a crawling, monstrous plague. In this way, large clutches of these foul beasts can come to infest coastlines areas. The bogwid is generally nocturnal, though it is not unusual for one to hunt during the day if it has gone a long time without feeding. A bogwid hunts patiently, concealing itself well in its natural habitat by heaping sand, seaweed, vegetation, and other detritus onto its body. Though a bogwid possesses limited intelligence, its animal cunning allows it to employ natural hazards to its advantage, setting up ambushes that cleverly integrate drop-offs, natural pits, and quicksand. As these creatures are also able to climb, it is not uncommon for bogwids to roost on rocky overhangs or in large trees, dropping down on unsuspecting victims from above. Alchemists pay a significant price for the glands in bogwid tentacles that produce the foul, viscous liquid the creatures excrete. However, these glands are difficult to extract fully intact  and must be properly stored in waters after removal. Appropriately dissected and transported, the glands fetch 25 gp apiece on the right market. Alchemists employ this putrid substance in various formulae to augment their effectiveness. Habitat & Society Though great numbers of bogwids take up residence in temperate, swampsy, coastlines regions and the damp caves that are sometimes found in such places, plenty of the creatures inhabit inland marshes as well. They have been known to adapt to warmer climes, but tropical bogwids are much rarer. The fetid creatures tend not to flourish near major settlements, even if those settlements are in close proximity to the bogwids' natural habitat. The reason is that the presence of a beast like this near a town strikes such revulsion and fear into a population that they quickly post sizable rewards for the destruction of the beast. Rangers who traverse marshes and wet caves eagerly seek out such lucrative bounties. Indeed, the fact that these monsters have not been hunted to extinction is a testimony to their revolting fecundity. As these creatures are asexual, bogwids also tend to be solitary, driving off gestated offspring soon after they reach maturity. Recently matured bogwids seek out their own territory. On the few occasions bogwid clutches form, they most often include a single adult accompanied by two to eight adolescents. These abhorrent creatures have a life expectancy of about 10 years. An older bogwid can be identified by its flesh, which becomes gray-green and increasingly dry as the creature ages. The larvae an older bogwid carries about eventually lead to its own downfall. In the end, the strongest of its young fight off weaker kin and burrow into the dying parent, exploding forth from the corpse in the usual manner 2 weeks later. A bogwid does not tolerate other major predators in its territory, hounding them relentlessly until such competitors are killed or find alternate homes for themselves. The bogwid is especially aggressive against crocodiles, which tend to be its chief rivals for prey in swampsy regions. In fact, a telltale sign of a bogwid having laid a claim to territory is the discovery of a crocodile corpse lying on its back, the stomach bloated with gestating larvae or torn out as though something exploded from within, suggesting an adolescent bogwid is not far away.",1600
Bogwiggle,1,aberration,temperate swamps,"This gray-green beast appears to be an oversized tadpole that never fully matured. Two large, bulbous eyes bulge from either side of its head, and a gaping mouth reveals jagged fangs. Scars cover its warty skin, running from its mouth all the way back to its finned tail.","Bogwiggles, also known as toad-hounds, are the degenerate spawn of boggards. They appear to be dog-sized tadpoles that have stopped halfway through the transformation to full-f ledged frogs. A single set of long legs sprouts from a bogwiggle's bulbous body, and a thick, rudderlike tail protrudes from its back. Barely more intelligent than dogs, bogwiggles spend the majority of their short, violent lives serving as hunting and guard animals for their capricious, toadlike masters. Bogwiggles can live up to 20 years, but because of swamps predators and the cruelty of their masters, most die long before reaching the age of 10. Bogwiggles always have the same skin tone as the boggards with which they live-typically gray, green, or black. Just as with boggards, bogwiggles lose their coloring as they age, and particularly old bogwiggles are often a pale gray, almost white color. The average bogwiggle measures just less than 3-1/2 feet long, not counting the tail. Most weigh roughly 65 pounds, but bogwiggles of much larger size have been reported. Ecology Like their boggard kin, bogwiggles begin life as nothing more than tadpoles, and born into the same stagnant pools. These degenerate and malformed boggard kin are victims of a form of targeted infanticide that transforms them into their current forms. As the tadpoles begin to mature, the priest-king keeps a watchful eye over the birth ponds, looking for sign that one of the tadpoles is stronger and more dominant than the others and could pose a threat to his rule. When the tadpoles begin the transformation into mature boggards, the priest-king feeds the dominant tadpole a toxic mixture of fermented swamps vegetation and crushed red beetles that stunts its metamorphosis, causing it to mutate into a bogwiggle. This process of intentional contamination renders the bogwiggle sterile. After a few months, it becomes clear to the caretakers of the birth pools that the stunted tadpole will never mature into a regular boggard. At this point, the bogwiggle is removed from the pool and treated as nothing more than a common animal. Most often, the priest-king or his minions take these abhorrent creatures in and train them as vicious guard and hunting animals. Gathered together with others of their kind, bogwiggles create packs that defer to the priest-king or their trainer as the alpha of the group. Bogwiggles are most often trained to guard the priest-king, his valuables or home, and the village as a whole. After bogwiggles reach full maturity at the age of 10 months, they finish their training. For the remainder of their short and violent lives, they hunt with boggards around the village and guard their master's belongings. Bogwiggles are omnivores, but greatly prefer flesh over algae and waters plants. Bogwiggles have a particular taste for insects and the flesh of humanoids. While hunting, a bogwiggle pack functions similarly to a pack of dogs or wolves. Using stealth and their increased mobility in their swampsy homeland, bogwiggles surprise their foes and attack with full force. Usually a number of bogwiggles single out an individual creature, trap it with their tongues, and use their strong jaws to finish it off. After the kill, bogwiggles prefer to allow the flesh to fester in swamps waters for a few days before consuming it. Habitat & Society Bogwiggles are found anywhere that their fully matured kin live, typically in temperate swamps, but occasionally in warmer climates such as those of tropical rivers and rainforests. Bogwiggles live within boggard communities, and are often found patrolling the perimeter around the primitive mud-huts that make up boggard villages. Usually, but not always, bogwiggles move freely through the village, living as pets and protecting certain homes and the birthing pools. One bogwiggle pack always stands guard inside the boggard priest-king's mound, watching the priest-king's consorts and valuables. Bogwiggle society, if it can be called such, is symbiotic with the boggards' own society. The boggards tolerate the existence of these ""runts,"" and keep them as loyal companions as long as they serve their purpose. If the boggards find the bogwiggles to be detrimental to the community, they kill the blighted creatures and feed the corpses to the other boggard tadpoles maturing in the birth pools. Considered animals and unfortunate mutations, bogwiggles rarely fill roles with responsibilities beyond hunting and protection, and even then they are supervised by mature, normal boggards. Variant Bogwiggles As with boggards and the amphibians they are related to, bogwiggles are highly sensitive to their environments, and have varying appearances and abilities based on the region they are found in. Additionally, bogwiggles can have differing abilities based on exactly when in the transformation from tadpole to boggard they were stunted. Some develop painful, piercing croaks that can stun a human into submission, some have two sets of legs, and others have only tails. Still others have poisonous flesh, or can even spread filth fever through their bites. Croaking Bogwiggle : These variant bogwiggles can produce loud and terrible croaks capable of stunning their enemies, much like their fully-developed kin. Because of how these bogwiggles developed, they lack the sticky tongue special ability. Any non-boggard creature within 30 feet of the bogwiggle must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. This effect can be used once every hour. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the same bogwiggle's croak for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Filthy Bogwiggle : Raised from tadpoles in putrid pools stewed with waste and stocked with rancid meat, these bogwiggles spend their lives surrounded by disease. As such, filthy bogwiggles possess an immunity to disease and their bite has the potential to inf lict their targets with filth fever . Poisonous Bogwiggle : Some bogwiggles that are raised in especially toxic pools of waters  develop their own poison glands that secrete a slimy poison that coats their skin and is infused in their flesh. Any creature that touches a poisonous bogwiggle or hits it with a natural attack risks poisoning itself. Bogwiggle slime does not affect boggards or boggard kin. In addition, poisonous bogwiggles are immune to poison of all kinds. Bogwiggle Slime: Skin-contact; save DC 11; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.",400

The body is encased in a thick, rubbery sheath of flesh and muscle that makes the bonesucker highly resistant to injury. The bonesucker moves about through the use of 5 thick tentacles at its base. Bonesuckers consume only the bones of an opponent by grabbing it and piercing its flesh with its hollow tentacles. The tentacles inject digestive enzymes into the bones, which break down and are sucked up as a pasty meal for the bonesucker-the attack of a bonesucker is horrifyingly painful.

Boruta,9,plant,any,"Piercing yellow eyes gaze from the mossy skull of this ivy-covered skeleton. Where bones should be, gnarled roots grow, and tangles of vines hang from its moldering chest like spilt viscera.","A distant cousin of shambling mounds, borutas are powerful wielders of natural magic that make their homes in marshes or wetlands, where their mysterious control over the natural environment is most useful. Though none are sure of the specific relationship between borutas and shambling mounds, the connection is clear when comparing the two, their powers and affinity for the marsheslands being the most obvious similarities. Borutas-or ""swamps lords,"" as they're sometimes called- resemble mossy, skeletal humans at first glance, with bonelike wooden frames, viny covering, and vivid yellow eyes. Considerably more intelligent than their shambling mound cousins, they claim wide territories-typically swamps, forests, jungles, or other lands thick with plant-life-and brook no insult to their realm. Highly defensive of the life within their lands, especially plants and thinking plant creatures, borutas view themselves as the avengers of those that can't defend themselves, and mercilessly repay destructive invaders with verdurous force. On the rare occasions when they deal peaceably with non-plant creatures, borutas cover their frightening forms with thick veils of grass or peat moss. Borutas generally stand about 7 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds. Ecology Surfacing from the dark waters of bogs and marshes, borutas are birthed from swamps and forestsed caves in isolated pods. Cocooned in a thick shell of reeds and swampsy grasses, a boruta grows inside its own chamber until it reaches maturity, about 2 years after the emergence of the pod. Upon reaching this stage of maturity, a swamps lord breaks out of its protective shell fully grown. Though formidable upon emergence, infant borutas are incredibly vulnerable while developing in their cocoons. If the shell-like pod is ruptured before development is complete, the boruta within ceases to grow, usually causing it to simply wither away. Few can say where borutas come from, though some claim that natural lands threatened with destruction or with strong ties to the First World produce them. A boruta's viny flesh typically takes a greenish hue, though these colors change with the natural progression of the seasons or to otherwise blend in with the foliage of its homeland. As a boruta ages, its leaves continues to darken, and the most ancient swamps lords possess foliage almost as black as the murky waters from which they emerge. How long a boruta might survive, no one knows, as the reclusive creatures sometimes vanish into their fecund homes and aren't seen for decades. Some propose the creatures are immortal-or at least have life spans on par with the oldest trees-so long as the territory they watch over remains healthy. Habitat & Society Borutas hold plant and animal life in the same esteem as humans typically hold members of their own race or other sentient creatures. As sentient plants, borutas share kinship with the oldest trees and slightest blades of grass in their territories, viewing all as members of their extended family and watching over all. Their manner of thinking and philosophies differ wildly from these of humanoids, being far more fundamentally tied into the cycle of seasons and the mysterious rhythms of the earth. Borutas understand that nature is rarely calm or peaceful, and that the mere act of moving can often be disruptive or outright destructive to other organisms, yet do what they can to keep forces outside of nature from disturbing or destroying the environments of their homes. Left to their own devices, they tend to plants and vulnerable animals, commune with the oldest growth and natural creatures of their territories, and encourage new growth. Should their homes be violated, however, whether by the axes of enterprising humanoids or the depredations of rampaging monsters, borutas do all they can to prevent future harm. Sometimes this might mean slaying a dangerous interloper, but in more extreme cases their vengeance might launch an extended campaign of natural violence against an entire community. Borutas try not to harm the innocent, but if they view certain neighboring creatures as fundamentally destructive, or are forced to choose between the lives of invaders and those of their plants, they will always side with nature. Such decisions often put borutas at odds with expanding humanoid communities, leading to tales of violent swamps monsters or evil spirits of the forests, though rarely do such stories consider the plants' points of view. Borutas are intelligent enough to reason with, but are stolid in their defense of their lands and will no more accept partial loss or brook lessened defilement of their homes than a community might assent to the murder of a mere fraction of its populace. Borutas rarely encounter others of their kind, being born alone and never leaving their territories of their own accord. They typically find themselves at odds with humanoids, and even the most nature-sensitive elves often find them disagreeable or alien enough to bear avoidance. Druids who know of a boruta in a region typically go out of their way to placate it and serve as peacemakers between the swamps lord and the communities of other humanoids; they often preach avoidance to all who would pass through the proud plant creature's lands. Despite their similar interests in watching over nature, treants rarely share territories with borutas, preferring highly forestsed lands while the swamps lords tend to favor darker lands and the meaner plants of the forests. When members of the two races do share lands, they might brief ly cooperate in defense of their forests, though treants typically disfavor boruta tactics, which they view as shortsighted and provocative. Fey, too, have mixed opinions of borutas, with goodly fey avoiding them, while the more neutral hold them in high regard. Yet borutas share a special alliance with shambling mounds, treating the wild plants as primitive cousins, often assembling and guiding tribelike communities of the mounds and cooperating with them to drive off those who threaten their lands.",6400
Botfly Swarm,4,vermin,warm jungles or swamps,"Like a cloud of black dust, a swirling swarm of insects hovers in the air. From within comes the low, droning buzz of thousands of tiny flies.","Common to sweltering jungles, warm swampslands, and lazy riversbanks, these pestilent fly swarms seek humanoid hosts for their eggs. While not as physically dangerous as their giant cousins, implanted botf ly larvae typically carry diseases that spread to the host. Infestations Parasites such as botf ly larvae cause infestations, a type of aff liction similar to diseases. Infestations can only be cured through specific means; otherwise, no matter how msaving throws are made, the infestation continues to aff lict the target.

Bottled Armada,6,construct,any,"A fleet of miniature ships, each secure in a glass bottle, flies through the air. The ships move as one, coordinating their attacks.","A ship in a bottle signifies patience and devotion. Parts are assembled through an obstinate hole to create the illusion of something impossible. The average model maker devotes months of delicate handling and blinding eyestrain to its creation. Most ships in bottles are built by sea captains and modeled after their vessels. As the devotion of a captain to his ship compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the Material Plane. waters sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of waters, see boats as perversions enabling landlubbers' insistence on venturing where they do not belong. These waters spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the waters spirit at the helm claims victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring. A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds. Ecology Model ships in bottles stand prominently on shelves in the quarters of captains and admirals, usually made to perfectly replicate their creators' ships. Once brought to life by a waters spirit, a ship in a bottle maneuvers through the air on waves of mist. The strings of its miniature ballistae winch with enough tension to fire, and the waters spirit turns a tribute into something that is both a weapon and a parody at once. Not all ships in bottles are captained willingly. Captains or admirals who desire more dramatic tributes to the ships they have commanded sometimes have mundane ships in bottles seemingly brought to life via magic. Through either great devotion or greater gold, they gain access to the magic necessary to bind waters spirits to their model ships. The magic binding a waters spirit to a ship in a bottle also enchants the elemental spirit into believing it is the captain and crew of a typical vessel. Magically bound waters spirits follow the orders of either the caster who bound them or the maker of the ship in a bottle, treating him or her as their admiral. Habitat & Society A ship in a bottle's life is on the high seas, and its waters spirit captain sets sail toward the nearest body of waters. Its mission is to seek and destroy land creatures on the seas, and tales of ships in bottles' voyages rarely speak of glory. When a ship in a bottle manages to survive long enough to log journeys, what can be extrapolated from its miniscule logbook makes for fascinating insight into the elemental mind. The ways in which the waters spirit captain justifies the world as seen from its viewpoint reads like a mix of mythology and a child's bathtime story. The spirit inhabiting this construct determines the nature of the crew and replicates tiny sailors on deck. These are solely to unnerve onlookers, as the spirit operates the ship in a bottle's sails and weaponry hydraulically. A waters spirit magically bound to a ship in a bottle agains its will often crews the vessel with manifested sailors based on the bottle's owner, or his descriptions of the original ship's crew. A ship in a bottle sails alone only when it has no other choice, and usually welcomes the opportunity to join, form, or lead a fleet with other waters spirits, flying tiny flags designed seemingly at random. Usually unbound waters spirits captain all the ships in a bottled armada, although sometimes an unbound waters spirit takes advantage of naive bound waters spirits. A chance meeting between individual ships in bottles is not the only manner in which fleets form. waters spirits sometimes conspire to commandeer multiple ships in bottles together, and nautical museums have reported dozens of ships in bottles flying off shelves and out to sea.

Brain Ooze,7,ooze,ruins or underground,Two slimy tentacles protrude from the sides of this brain-shaped mass of quivering ooze.,"A brain ooze  resembles almost precisely the raw brain of a human, save for the eldritch energy surrounding it and the twin tentacles extending from its sides. The creature's thought patterns are unusually powerful, and cause painful mental feedback in the minds of other conscious beings. Other intelligent beings are nothing more than cattle and playthings to brain oozes-victims to be tormented, thought patterns to be consumed. Brain oozes prefer to manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conf lict within groups, or lure one or two victims away for the kill. Brain oozes derive particular satisfaction from forcing an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping away all knowledge of the crimes from the victim's memory. They torment such hapless puppets again and again, forcing them to commit ever greater atrocities. Once weary of their sport they return the modified memories with dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of the victim's final despair. Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting the thoughts of living creatures. Animals and less intelligent creatures provide little nourishment, but they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies. After several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly identical brains, each retaining only a portion of the knowledge and experiences of the parent. The similarities between intellect devourers and brain oozes have not gone unnoticed, but the two species appear to have little in common beyond appearance. Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of an ancient race's failed attempt to achieve immortality by preserving their minds via alien technology or magic.",3200
Bralani Azata,6,outsider,any,"Silver-white hair the color of a lightning strike whips about this poised elf-like archer, his eyes swirling with vibrant colors.","Bralanis are among the fiercest and wildest of the azatas, living from moment to moment and always on the lookout for chances to test their skill in battle. In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and mtales describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest storms. Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators-or whenever else such opportunities present themselves-bralani are quick to suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal prowess.",2400

Brass Man,7,construct,elemental plane of fire,"This creature resembles a humanoid constructed of brass. Its features are exquisite and delicate, and ancient runes and symbols adorn its body.","Brass men are humanoid-shaped constructs built by the powerful efreet of the City of Brass. They are created for the sole purpose of guarding some efreeti secret within the walls of the City. Some are created as battle allies and aid the efreet in battle against their enemies. They are rarely encountered elsewhere, though on occasion one is sent to the Material Plane by its efreet creator to retrieve an object or creature. Brass men are very tough physical opponents and difficult to stop. Typically a brass man begins combat by spitting molten brass on the closest opponent before moving into melee where it attacks with its huge greatsword or its powerful fists.

Brijidine,17,outsider,any,This beautiful woman has flesh made of lava. She soars through the skies on a trail of fire.,"Brijidines are passionate, powerful azatas attuned to the powers of earth and fire. They love basking in volcanoes, writing poetry, tending to sick creatures, and pursuing spicy recipes. The quickest way to befriend a brijidine is to present her with a fireproof copy of an exotic poem or a bag of rare peppers. Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty limerick. The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while mazatas look to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes. A brijidine stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",102400
Brimorak,5,outsider,any,"Standing just over three feet tall, this bestial humanoid wears filthy, tattered robes and has blue-gray skin decorated with strange, coiling stripes. Dark fur grows on its head and arms, and its feet end in burning hooves. Its eyes glow as red as the flaming sword it wields in one hand, and its breath fills the surrounding air with noxious gray smoke.","Although brimorak demons are generally limited to regions of the Abyss where fire and smoke hold sway, in those regions they are vast in number. Demon lords like Flauros use brimoraks as the primary infantry troops in Abyssal armies-although their command of fire makes them less effective against most fiends, they are particularly devastating against mother foes. Brimoraks are small in stature, rarely standing over 3 feet in height, yet surprisingly strong for their size. Those who underestimate these demons often don't live to learn of their errors, for brimoraks are quick to press the advantage against larger enemies after softening them up with fire magic. A brimorak's dense musculature and bones result in unexpected weight as well-one of these creatures usually weighs nearly 200 pounds. Ecology Brimoraks form from the souls of arsonists and those who used fire in life to torture and kill innocent victims- especially witches, heretics, and other such ""criminals""-via burning at the stake or on a pyre. Although a brimorak is not damaged by fire, it still feels the pain of fire as long as it lives-the boiling of its own blood is a constant reminder of its sins from a previous life. This state of constant pain is alleviated somewhat after a brimorak uses one of its fire-based spell-like abilities or its breath weapon-while this has no game effect on the demon, the temporary relief does encourage it to use its magic and breath weapon as often as possible in combat. Mbrimoraks become masochistic creatures as a result of the constant pain. In combat they often display little to no regard for their personal safety, provoking attacks of opportunity or ignoring obvious foes for the chance to hurt a helpless foe. Yet this disregard for safety doesn't descend into truly self-destructive behavior-a brimorak with fewer than half its hit points becomes suddenly more careful about its actions. Unlike most demons, who can teleport at will, brimoraks can only use this powerful spell-like ability once per day, and they generally rely upon it to get themselves out of peril rather than to ambush foes. Habitat & Society On the Abyss, brimoraks usually serve more powerful demons as taskmasters, thugs, or soldiers. These brimorak demons know little more than battle, and when not fighting together against a foe they tend to fight each other in an endless conf lict for superiority. On the Material Plane, however, brimoraks take on a much more authoritative role. While most are called via spells like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding in order to serve mortal spellcasters as minions, now and then a brimorak escapes control and can remain on Golarion. Freed from demonic overlords and binding spellcasters, a brimorak loose on the Material Plane understands that it is viewed as a monster and reacts intelligently-it does not immediately revert to an orgy of arson and destruction, but instead retreats into hiding. Free brimoraks prefer to lurk in rundown slums in large cities, in catacombs or sewers, or in remote wilderness regions. Typically, a lone brimorak seeks out a tribe of savage humanoids like goblins, orcs, gnolls, or barbarians and establishes itself as the dominant force for the tribe by killing its leader and several of the tribe's more powerful members-whatever it takes to get the tribe's survivors to bow down before the demon. As a result, the majority of brimoraks encountered on the Material Plane are encountered as lone creatures serving as the leaders of tribes of fecund and aggressive humanoids. Often, and particularly in the case of tribes of superstitious humanoids, the brimorak is regarded as both a chieftain and a god, with tribal adepts actually worshiping the demon out of a mixture of fear and ignorance. Of course, the brimorak is only too pleased to perpetuate such beliefs by requiring frequent sacrifices, using its defensive abilities and spell-like abilities to perform ""miracles,"" and periodically punishing its followers for real or imagined transgressions. Eventually, the brimorak has the tribe so cowed and under his control that he can finally turn to the joys of mayhem by ordering the tribe to take up ill-advised crusades against neighboring tribes or settlements. The brimorak continues to order these attacks on nearby victims until his tribe is destroyed or high-powered opponents arrive to stop it. Brimoraks who are finally confronted by foes capable of defeating them generally don't stay around to defend their followers, but instead simply teleport to some other region, whereupon they begin the process anew by seeking a new tribe of doomed savages to rule.",1600
Brine Zombie,1,undead,waters,This creature appears as a rotting humanoid dressed in tattered and ragged clothing. Its semi-bloated body glistens from the slimy mixture of waters and seaweed that hangs from its form. The creature's rotting flesh is blue-green in color. No semblance of life burns in its eyes.,"Brine zombies are the remnants of a ship's crew that has perished at sea. They are mindless creatures, not very pleasant to look at, and relentless in their attacks on the living. The spark of evil that brought them back from the oceans depths drives them to seek the living so they may join them in their watersy graves. Brine zombies appear much as they did in life. Brine zombies attack an opponent with their cutlasses or fists in melee. If a brine zombie successfully grabs an opponent, it dives overboard and attempts to drown the victim by pinning him underwaters. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Brontotherium,8,animal,temperate forests or plains,This massive beast vaguely resembles a rhinoceros with a forked nose horn. Its powerful body is covered with short bristly hair.,"Brontotheriums  are found on lost continents and large islands far from civilization. They dwell in wooded primeval forests bordering broad plains where there is plenty of vegetation for these herbivores to feast upon. They generally forage at night, in the early morning hours, or early evening hours so as to avoid the midday heat. Territorial, herds tend to keep to themselves and sometimes clash with other herds of their kind, except on common ground . When two herds meet , the males quickly charge, butting heads and goring with their horns in an attempt to force the other herd to leave the area. Mating season for brontotheriums occurs anytime throughout the year. A male selects a female and fighting often ensues between them before the mating ritual begins. Gestation lasts for 400 days after which time the female gives birth to one live young. Within one year, the young becomes independent and no longer depends on its mother for food and protection. Maturity is reached within 10 years  and brontotheriums have an average lifespan of 40 years. A brontotherium weighs two tons, is about 14 feet long, and stands eight feet tall at the shoulder. Its fur is dark brown or grayish-brown. Brontotheriums defend their herds from hunters and predators by charging and goring foes with their massive horn. When a herd is in danger, they charge, tearing up everything in their path and trampling lesser creatures which stand in their way. Sometimes before charging a brontotherium lets out a snort, growl, or roar to warn potential adversaries of its intent. If locked in combat defending the herd or young, a brontotherium always fights to the death. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
Bronze Giant,11,humanoid,temperate mountains or coastlines,You see a huge muscular being that is often mistaken for a statue of the gods. I t is well proportioned and has flesh that gleams like polished bronze and hair the color of copper wire.,"These giants are said to by some to have been sired by the Vulcan gods. Others claim that they are awakened constructs with the flesh and blood of a living being encased in a skin of pure bronze. Both could be true, for these giants truly do have hardened skin the color of bronze. Due to their unique skin, bronze giants disdain wearing sort of crafted armor. Bronze giants are loners, and tend to avoid large gatherings of their rare kind, seeking mates in volcanic regions, where they remain together long enough to ensure the survival of their progeny, teach them how to fight and then move on. All bronze giants claim to be the descendants of mighty Talos and are known to hire themselves out as mercenaries and defenders of cities within eyesight of great volcanoes. More than one hero has sought out a bronze giant for training. They may also serve as heroes and brute force, their appearance on a battlefield often sending would be invaders fleeing. Bronze giants stand about 25 feet tall and weigh about 14,000 pounds. They have hair of black, copper, red, or dark brown. Their eyes are gray, brown, or black. They speak Common and Giant. Bronze giants live to be 500 years old. Bronze giants prefer to dress in loose-fitting garb, such as robes and tunics. Sandals, rather than boots are usually worn on their feet, and mbronze giants wear rings, bracelets, and other jewelry fashioned of silver, bronze, or gold. Bronze giants start combat from a distance, hurling large rocks and using spears before closing to fight with fists or sword. When confronted by mfoes they let out a self-deprecating laugh that strikes fear into their enemies. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.",12800

Brownie,1,fey,temperate or warm forests,This tiny creature resembles an elf with greenish skin. Its hair is light and it is dressed in bright clothing.,"A brownie is a timid, quiet fey creature that prefers to live only among its own kind. Most brownies dwell in pastoral areas untouched by civilization, such as deep forests and wild lands far from other creatures. Brownies are rarely over 18 inches tall. Their hair is always some earth tone such as brown, gray, or tawny. Most brownies prefer green or otherwise brightly colored clothing. They may be distant relatives of pixies and halflings, but this has never been proven. Brownies avoid combat unless forced. If unable to employ spells, brownies attack with tiny longswords.

Brume,10,aberration,any,"This semi transparent being has the appearance of a humanoid wrapped in a soggy funeral shroud. Long claws extend from the arms of the shroud, when its hood is thrown back a nose-less, ear-less face filled with needle like fangs and sunken black eye-sockets that glow with two wicked golden points of light. The creature has no apparent legs, seeming to hover inches from the ground, its ""feet"" nothing more than foul swirling vapors.","These strange creatures of extraplanar origin dwell within the mists of the Styx, where they are known to strangle the life from the living who finds themselves lost there. Brumes begin tracking enemies which enter their territory, seeking to steal personal effects from their target in an attempt to gain information about its strengths and weaknesses. Brumes are almost invisible in fog, making them difficult to spot and even harder to kill. They feed off the energy of lost souls, devouring the lost dead of Styx as readily as they do the living, absorbing whatever energy remains in its victims and leaving behind a dried husk in their wake. Occasionally brumes find their way into the material planes and reside near planar conduits and crossing points that lead into the Styx. Brumes may be bribed to act as guides through passage into Styx, but usually demand some form of living sacrifice in return. Brume are believed to understand several languages though they are not known to speak. Brumes rise from the mists, attacking with claws in an attempt to strangle their enemies silently and unseen. When faced with overwhelming numbers they seek to escape into the fog, where they bide their time, tracking foes over great distance, until such time that their foes leave the misty areas that they call home. Mwho have been attacked by a brume and lived have no recollection of having fought them and seem withdrawn from others, having no memory of the attack itself and missing large pieces of their own identity. A brume's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Brush Thylacine,2,animal,temperate forests,"This odd creature is about the size of a dog, but it has the slender build of a cat, heavy whiskers, and dark stripes down its back. Its long tail flips about, smacking the ground as it scans the woods. It yips and bays in a complex pattern, offering warning to anything that may cross its path.","Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities. Ecology At a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees. While thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability. By most standards, a thylacine's senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting. Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms. Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands. Ma farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long , and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds. Habitat & Society Thylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike mmarsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years. Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development. During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or other potential threats. Regional Variants Several breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here. Blood Cougar: Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template . Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added , and gather in packs of 2-10. Sarusan Wolf: The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain Power Attack as a bonus feat.

Brykolakas,6,undead,waters,"This creature appears as a rotting humanoid with bluish-gray skin and blackish, unkempt hair. Its eyes are sunken and gray and its hands end in razor-sharp talons with blackened nails.","Brykolakas are undead creatures that inhabit sunken cities or underwaters caves. Their true origin remains a mystery to even the most learned of sages though stories among the learned speak of dark necromantic arts involving ancient magicks and packs of ghouls. Brykolakases spend much of their time swimming the waves and terrorizing seafarers, boarding ships at night and carrying away unsuspecting passengers and crewmembers. Entire ships have docked in coastlines towns, cargo intact, without a single clue as to the whereabouts or fate of the crew. When such an event occurs, a brykolakas is often blamed, its name being spoken in hushed whispers by the superstitious lest they anger such a creature and bring its wrath to bear on the town. Some of these creatures lair near coastlines towns or villages and occasionally raid such settlements at night, whisking away livestock, children, and the like. Events such as this are rare, but do happen from time to time. A typical brykolakas stands between 6 to 7 feet tall and weighs 200 to 250 pounds. Its eyes, though gray and dull, often flash with a spark of hatred . The creature most often dresses in flowing and rotting robes and gowns of grays, greens, or blues. A brykolakas likes to attack its foes when they don't suspect it. A single brykolakas has been known to follow a slow-moving ship of living creatures for miles waiting for the right moment to strike. It enters melee slashing and tearing at its foes using its diseased claws. If fighting a land-based creature , the brykolakas likes to grapple the foe and quickly dive under the waves, victim in tow, in an attempt to drown its opponent. If encountered with a retinue of lacedons, a brykolakas hangs back while its minions soften up the opponents. The brykolakas then moves in and finishes them off with its claws. A brykolakas is not a foolish creature. If faced with overpowering odds, it flees at the first opportunity, though sometimes the creature feigns such a retreat to lure its victims in where it springs to the attack again.

Buckawn,2,fey,temperate forests,This creature is a halfling-sized humanoid with swarthy skin and dark hair. Its eyes are greenish-brown and its clothes are brown.,"Buckawns are somehow related to brownies, but they are nowhere near as kind-hearted and playful. Buckawns are extremely reclusive and rarely have dealings with outside races. Trade of kind between a buckawn tribe and another race is virtually unheard of.

Trespassers, evil-doers, and those that disturb the natural beauty of a buckawn domain are dealt with quickly-and permanently if necessary. A buckawn stands about 2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds. Buckawns favor daggers and darts in combat.

Bugbear,2,humanoid,temperate mountains,"This dark-furred creature raises a spiked morningstar, its tiny, milk-white eyes glittering with the thrill of the coming kill.","The bugbear is the largest of the goblinoid races, a lumbering brute that stands at least a head taller than most humans. They are loners, preferring to live and kill on their own rather than form tribes of their own kind, yet it isn't uncommon to find small bands of bugbears working together, or dwelling in goblin or hobgoblin tribes where they function as elite guards or executioners. Bugbears do not form large warrens like goblins or nations like hobgoblins; they prefer smaller-scale mayhem that lets them keep their favorite acts  on a more personal level. Humans are a bugbear's favored prey, and most count the flesh of humanity as a dietary staple. Grisly trophies of ears or fingers are common bugbear decorations. Bugbears, when they turn to religion, favor gods of murder and violence, with various demon lords being favorites. A typical bugbear stands 7 feet in height and weighs 400 pounds. The Nature of Goblinoid Evil Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, despite having superficial similarities, each represent a different face of evil. Hobgoblins are ordered and methodical in their evil, forming vast armies, warbands, and despotic nations. Goblins are the primal evil, seeking only cruelty and petty victimization as they can find it, be that among their own kind or against their neighbors. Yet the evil personified by the bugbear may be the most terrifying, for they actively seek to inf lict pain and suffering in the most destructive ways possible. When a hobgoblin kills, it's because of tradition and order. When a goblin kills, it's for fun. But when a bugbear holds its blade, it kills only when it can be assured that the murder will cause maximum pain and suffering to those its weapon does not touch; to a bugbear, the true goal of murder is to strike not at the victim, but at those who held the victim dear.",600
Bulette,7,magical beast,temperate hills,This armor-plated creature's toothy maw gapes wide as a fin-like dorsal plate rises between its shoulders.,"The creation of some unknown arcanist in millennia past, the bulette has bred true to become one of the fiercest predators of the hills. Burrowing rapidly through the earth just beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to the common appellation ""landshark."" Bulettes are notoriously foul-tempered, attacking far larger creatures with no regard for personal safety. Solitary beasts except for the occasional mated pair, they spend most of their time patrolling the perimeters of territories that can stretch up to 30 square miles, hunting game and punishing interlopers with a fury that shakes the hillsides. Bulettes are perfect eating machines, consuming bones, armor, and even magical items with their powerful jaws and churning stomach acid. Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes elf flesh-a peccadillo mpoint to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Half lings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no half ling with sense ventures into bulette country casually. The bulette is a cunning fighter, surprising foes with its impressive agility. One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended. Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow-yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely.",3200

Burning Dervish,7,outsider,Elemental Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies,This creature looks like a normal human with symbols and tattoos of alien design covering almost all of its body.,"Burning dervishes are the fanatical minions of the Sultan of Efreet . It is said that the burning dervishes were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet in exchange for greater power over the Elemental Plane of Fire. Burning dervishes are virtually indistinguishable from human beings, and indeed spend a great amount of time in the Material Plane as agents of the Sultan of Efreet, seeking to spread worship of the Sultan as true God of Elemental Fire. Other tasks of the burning dervishes are as assassins and spies, often leading daring sneak attacks against foes of the Sultan or procuring powerful relics for his pleasure. The burning dervishes have a citadel atop the Great Ziggurat of the City of Brass which serves as the central temple to their zealous faith. It is from this ziggurat that the Sultan communes with his worshippers, sending them out on jihads throughout the planes to further his name and power. Burning dervishes usually turn themselves invisible before attacking in an attempt to catch their foes by surprise. In combat, the burning dervish attacks with its falchion. Depending on the power of its opponent, a burning dervish either uses enlarge person on itself or reduce person on its opponent. A burning dervish that is outclassed or overmatched either takes to the air and flees or attempts to plane shift to escape. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.",3200
Bythos,16,outsider,any,"A shimmering, colorless mass congeals to form a four-armed humanoid shape with an eye-like pattern in its torso.","The bythos are guardians of time and planar travel-indeed, to bythos, the act of aging is nothing more than a highly specialized method of travel. Although bythos themselves have no additional method of traveling through time, they scour the multiverse, hunting for creatures that do have the ability to time-travel and may have abused this ability. Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of planar travel, such as tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the use of planar travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the damage. In most cases, ""repair"" is analogous to the death of the creature responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in temporal stasis can also solve the problem. While a bythos's body may seem to be made of smoke and vapor, it is strangely solid to the touch, feeling not dissimilar to dry stone. A bythos is 13 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.",76800
Caasimolar,23,outsider,any,"A wizened old man with a silver beard and balding head approaches. His eyes are ruby red and small rounded horns jut from his head, just above his eyes. His fingernails are ruby red, as is his long, snaky, thinly, forked tail. He is dressed in robes of purple, white, and amber.","In the centuries when Lucifer ruled Hell, Caasimolar stood beside him as President. He was second in command behind only Lucifer himself. When the Great Uprising occurred Caasimolar was offered a position in Hell's new court, but he promptly replied by slaying the messenger and all the guards that had delivered the offer. Displeased with his answer, Asmodeus cast him out of Hell along with the rest of Lucifer's court when the Great Uprising was ended. Caasimolar is a cruel and malevolent creature and spends most of his time in his tower in Lucifer's basalt palace on the plane of Infernus. From his tower he enjoys watching the devils torture captured souls, particularly human souls. When not delighting himself in the torture of others, he is listening to reports from his vast network of spies he has encamped in the arch-devils' palaces in Hell. Though Caasimolar is no longer in Hell, little goes on there that he doesn't know about. His loyalty to Lucifer has never been in question and he keeps a close watch on those that offer advice, aid, information, or the like to his master. Caasimolar is never encountered alone except in his tower. When walking the halls of Malefacta  or tending to duties elsewhere in Infernus, he always has a retinue of 1 pit fiend and 2-5 bearded devils with him. When first engaged in battle, Caasimolar uses his fear effect against all within range that can hear him. When encountered with his personal retinue of devils, he prefers to let them fight, while he hangs back and peppers the enemy with slay living effects  or cones of cold. If his enemies force him into battle, he begins by releasing a slay living effect against who he deems to be the most powerful foe in the group. If this fails, he quickly unleashes a lightning bolt from his rod at the same target. If forced to fight close quarter, he relies on his rod's physical power as well as its spell-like effects, and he utilizes his spell-like abilities. If the day is lost, Caasimolar summons devils to cover his escape before teleporting away to safety. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",819200

Cairn Linnorm,18,dragon,cold hills,"Pallid and horribly gaunt, this enormous but emaciated dragonlike creature has two forearms and no wings.","Cairn linnorms prefer to dwell in necropolises, amid reaches of burial mounds, or in caverns below the scorched earth of legendary battlefields. These linnorms particularly relish the flavor of undead flesh-while they cannot consume incorporeal undead, regions they haunt are typically barren of corporeal undead not canny enough to avoid the cairn linnorm's ravenous appetite. An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so.

Caizel,16,outsider,any,This astonishingly beautiful creature stands about 6 feet tall. Her skin is copper in color and her eyes are blue-green. She has long raven-black hair and her hands end in sharpened claws. She is clad in a robe of gold.,"Caizel is an exquisitely beautiful demoness known throughout the planes for her ability to seduce just about being she desires. Mdukes of Hell and lords of the Abyss have fallen prey to her; some have met their demise at her hands as well. She was once the concubine of a demon lord  and self-styled Queen of the Succubi, but he grew displeased with her after she killed several of his other concubines and targeted her for death. She fought back and managed to slay the demon lord before making her escape. She now resides on her own and serves no one, though she does often sell her services to a demon prince or lord who wishes to employ her for some scheme or plot. Caizel detests Beluiri and would like nothing more than to destroy her. Likewise, Beluiri would like to see Caizel gone once and for all. Beluiri once worked with Caizel on a mission to seduce a powerful demon prince. When the ruse was discovered, Beluiri betrayed Caizel; leaving her to the devices of the prince and his fiendish minions. Thinking her gone, Beluiri began calling herself ""The Temptress"" and touted herself as the seductress of the lower planes. Since Caizel's return, she has attempted to reclaim that title and now seeks revenge against Beluiri. Caizel is an astonishing beautiful creature standing just under 6 feet tall. Her skin is delicate, soft, and copper in color. Her eyes are blue-green. Two tiny horns are hidden beneath her long, raven-black hair. Her hands, while clawed, are shapely and delicate. Small leather wings protrude from her back, but she usually keeps these hidden beneath her robes and gowns. Caizel prefers clothes of gold, silver, sapphire, or black. Caizel tries to avoid melee combat if possible, preferring to use her skills and abilities against a lone target that she can easily manipulate and control. If forced into combat, she immediately uses her summon demons ability to summon a pack of hezrous to her aid. After summoning her demonic allies, she throws up a protection from good or magic circle against good and uses her wall of fire ability against her aggressors. In battle, she uses her touch of ecstasy ability to disable opponents and then finishes them off with a kiss or allows her comrades to finish them off. If combat is going against her, she uses her ethereal jaunt or greater teleport to escape. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",76800
Calathgar,4,plant,cold forests,The acrid scent of vinegar wafts from this shield-sized blossom. Amid shocking blue petals slowly twitches a cluster of sharp stamens arranged like a ring of teeth within a leafy muzzle.,"Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or ""hail lilies,"" grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously- seek a chillsing revenge when their young are despoiled. The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds. Ecology Calathgars are immediately identifiable, even from a distance, by their skies-blue petals, a color repeated by few other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed, defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall blue flowers-hence mhorticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies. It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display kind of concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to communicate function as soon as their buds first grow-typically within 2 weeks of sprouting from the cold earth. Two rings of sensory organs help calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight, but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to see-though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures. At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor. For all their developments as a species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits calathgars-allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise find inhospitably warm-but it also pervades the roots and internal structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its seeds-freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with growth-typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar's life. Habitat & Society Calathgars have little in the way of society, other than grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants' psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as  humanoids can pass on information by speech. Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to care for their young and seek reprisal should harm befall them. Should an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their young, planting a new generation in the killer's frozen flesh. While calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak.",1200

Cambions, unlike their ""sisters"" the alu-demons, are always chaotic evil and care little for anyone or anything but their own well-being. They are selfish, self-centered, and egotistical. Cambions hate humans and are often employed as assassins. Cambions are always male. Much like alu-demons, cambions are often sent to the Material Plane to seduce mortals or tempt them in some way. The typical cambion stands 6 or 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds or more. Cambions are deadly in combat, attacking relentlessly until their opponents are dead, often employing various poisons in battle to end the fight quickly.

Camulatz,9,magical beast,tropical jungles,"Vibrant blue and yellow feathers adorn the body of this giant, parrot-like bird, but its curved beak and powerful talons are instead adorned with dried blood and gore.","Hidden within the high canopy overlooking the junglesfloor dwells a race of enormous, vicious, and vibrantly colored birds known as camulatz. Possessing a cruel intelligence, camulatz are vile headhunters and aggressive demon-worshipers, preying on all sentient creatures as sacrifices to their chosen demon lord: Pazuzu, King of the Wind Demons. Camulatz revel in trickery and bloodshed, luring victims into ambushes where the camulatz can indulge their bloodlust and take their victims' heads as grisly trophies. The iridescent coloration of a camulatz's feathers assists in mesmerizing unfortunate souls, luring them to the killing ground below the brightly colored bird's aerie. Camulatz also have a special affinity for sounds, naturally mimicking voices and animal noises, while perfecting the magical ability to displace such sounds, making them seem to emanate from other creatures or objects. Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above. All camulatz possess sharp talons on their feet, capable of rending the most heavily armored foes, but they rely on their cruelly curved beaks to decapitate their victims. The vivid patterns of a camulatz's feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can def lect ranged attacks. A mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure. Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display. Ecology Camulatz are carnivores who prefer the raw flesh of intelligent creatures above all else, but they also hunt large junglesmammals, reptiles, and even fish to augment their diet or when their favored prey is particularly scarce. The ferocious birds especially enjoy eating the heads of their victims, whom they decapitate with their razorsharp beaks, preferably while the victim is still alive. Camulatz devour the bodies of their victims without ceremony, but they take the severed heads back to their treetop aeries for ritual feasts, dining on the eyes, ears, tongues, and brains as savored delicacies. Thereafter, camulatz save their victims' skulls as trophies, using them as tribute to Pazuzu, ornamentation for their nests, and markers for the bounds of their territory and favored hunting grounds. While camulatz never forget which individual is responsible for harvesting a given skull, most groups prefer to store their skulls communally, as they believe that their demonic patron finds more appeal in a single titanic collection of skulls than msmall individual ones. As such, each aerie has a central altar where skulls are stacked in order of ascending prominence. This location, known as the Place of Screeching, is often used as a meeting place or the location for important rituals, and powerful females may occasionally choose to mate directly upon the altar in the hope that Pazuzu will notice and, in his demonic voyeurism, provide the resulting offspring with fiendish boons. For both genders, however, providing the skull that crowns the altar's tower is a lifelong goal for every individual. Camulatz mate only once a year, or even less, usually with different partners on each occasion. During mating cycles, female camulatz use their hypnotic display ability to lure and seduce their chosen mates, mating frantically and violently with the entranced, nearly helpless males. Afterward, females lay 1-3 eggs, which they jealously guard thereafter-even driving away the fathers-until the eggs hatch in about 3 months. Females communally raise their young for 2 years until the hatchlings reach adulthood, at which point the fully grown camulatz separate according to gender-the males band together to hunt and raid, while the females establish new aeries to maintain and defend. Camulatz have lifespans of 80 to 100 years, and though they have no written histories or oral legends beyond the braggadocio of individual members, their memories are long, and a camulatz never forgets a slight or the face of a prey animal that got away. Habitat & Society Camulatz make their homes in treetop aeries high above the junglesfloor, only venturing below their canopy homes when hunting. Male camulatz range the farthest af ield, often spending days or even weeks away from home, building temporary nests on the borders of their territory from which to launch hunting sorties. Meanwhile, female camulatz rule over the larger aeries, safeguarding their eggs and hatchlings. Both genders are equally violent and capable in combat. Camulatz believe they are the chosen followers of Pazuzu, revering the demon prince in all they do. They view the act of decapitation as a holy sacrifice to Pazuzu, and their faith requires them to appease their demon lord by sacrificing a sentient creature at least once per month. Camulatz believe that consuming a creature's head gives them some measure of the victim's power-hence the reason for preying on intelligent creatures rather than simple beasts-and that these ritual feedings attract the favor of their demon lord. Camulatz bear a special hatred for monstrous humanoids and worshipers of Lamashtu, taking up the same battle waged between Pazuzu and the Mother of Monsters. As such, the skulls of gnolls, monkey goblins, and junglesharpies are especially prized by camulatz, and frequently decorate their lairs. Some Mwangi tribes even appease camulatz by offering them such captives in exchange for safe travel through the camulatz's territory or safety from predation, though deals made with the notoriously fickle bird people are tenuous at best. Mare the tribes who thought to purchase their safety with slaves and sacrifices, only to find their members' own skulls mounted among the sacrifices in the camulatz's Place of Screeching.",6400

Canopy Creeper,8,plant,warm forests,"What at first appeared to be nothing more than a tangle of thick, twisted vines growing among the canopy of the trees suddenly coils itself into a large mass dangling high above. A large beaklike maw emerges from the center of the fecund mass, numerous thick, grasping vines whipping through the air.","A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semi-sentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forests canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted junglesvines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed. The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available. Ecology Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper. While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils. A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures-such as small monkeys-can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size. Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures. Habitat & Society A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouf lage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape. A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures.",4800

Carnivorous Blob,13,ooze,any,"Rolling and twitching like a massive wad of translucent ooze, this crimson blob reaches out amorphous pseudopods in all directions.","While sages debate whether the first carnivorous blobs were created by a mad wizard, formed in foul fleshwarping vats in some sinister city, or traveled to this world trapped in the core of a meteor, there is one thing they all agree on-none wish to get close enough to study the monstrosity. Carnivorous blobs move like a typical ooze, rolling out blobs of its fleshy material in haphazard directions, and pulling its bulk across the ground, up walls, and even through the waters. If a carnivorous blob goes for more than 24 hours without a source of food, it drops into a sort of hibernation, resembling nothing so much as a pool of gelatinous blood. The creature springs to life quickly and hungrily as soon as living prey comes within range of its senses.",25600
Carnivorous Crystal,11,ooze,underground,"The facets of this crystalline formation shift and vibrate, as though in anticipation.","Natives of the endless caverns of the Plane of Earth, carnivorous crystals normally lead quiet existences, subsisting on minerals leeched from the surrounding rock. Living creatures, however, provide a veritable feast, as devouring the minerals in their bones and blood allows a crystal to reproduce in mere hours instead of years. Though lacking in anything that could be called intelligence, carnivorous crystals sense the living, and hunger for the sustenance trapped within their bodies. On the Plane of Earth and in the deepest caverns of the Material Plane, ancient carnivorous crystals grow without bounds, reaching incredible sizes.",12800

Carrion Moth,5,aberration,temperate forests,"This creature resembles a giant-sized moth with long, beautiful wings covered in rippling patterns resembling skulls. Its head is rather centipede-like and four long tentacles surround its mouth. Its mouth has a single pair of needle-like mandibles.","The carrion moth is believed by sages to be an advanced form of a slime crawler. Just as the caterpillar grows into a moth, sages believe the mature slime crawler eventually sheds its form and transforms into the carrion moth. No cocoon or evidence has been found to support this theory, but it is widely accepted among the more learned sages of the world. The carrion moth is a large moth-like creature growing to a maximum length of 20 feet. Its wings are lined with tiny holes and veins that allow the carrion moth to emit a whining drone that affects all creatures that hear it. Carrion moths are attracted to the stench of decaying flesh and the light of anything larger than a torch or lantern. A carrion moth attacks by biting with its mandibles and slapping with its tentacles. Paralyzed creatures are carried off and devoured.

Carrionstorm,1,undead,near ghouls,"Bits of feather and flesh buzz around this swarm of rotting ravens like flies, countless lifeless eyes staring out from the chaos.","Where the dead walk, the carrion birds follow. In most cases, the unfortunate birds that feast on the remains of fallen undead creatures simply grow diseased and die. Yet the flesh of some ghouls has an altogether different effect upon such scavengers, and when they die of the poisoned repast, they do not stay dead for long. Alone, an undead crow or vulture is little more than a hideous mockery, but in rare cases where ghoulish activity is thick, entire colonies of carrion birds can succumb to undeath, retaining their flock mentality yet no longer seeking the flesh of the freshly dead to sate their hunger. Carrionstorms, as these flocks of undead birds are called, find brief respite from their morbid hunger only when their meals are warm and screaming. Carrionstorms are typically found near graveyards, haunted structures, or abandoned villages where ghouls have been active. Mnecromancers and cultists of Urgathoa have a particular fondness for carrionstorms, and since the birds have a strange respect for the symbol of the Pallid Princess, rookeries of them are often found roosting in the nooks of the goddess of undeath's macabre cathedrals. Although the individual undead birds that make up a carrionstorm are little more intelligent than they were in life, as a whole, a carrionstorm forms a rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a slight bit more intellect than the typical bird. This not only allows the undead birds to utilize basic tactics, but allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and superstitious communities.",400

Cassisian,2,outsider,good-aligned plane,"This finely crafted golden helm is decorated with intricate filigree, and flutters gracefully through the air on feathered wings.","Cassisians are the weakest sort of angel, but are absolutely dedicated to the cause of good. They serve as messengers for more powerful angels, and on the Material Plane they are often bound to good mortals to serve as familiars, acting as spiritual guides, reciting platitudes and quoting scripture from various benign faiths and philosophies . A 7th-level lawful good spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can select a cassisian as a familiar. A cassisian's true form is a helmet possessing a pair of bird's wings. The exact style of helmet varies by the deity the angel serves-most appear to be steel with angular cheek-plates, though some resemble bascinets, skullcaps, great helms, or even samurai helmets, and a few older cassisians appear to be bronze or even leather. Though cassisians can assume other forms , they find it strange and rarely stay in that form for more than a few minutes. Typically formed from the souls of trustworthy and pious soldiers, some cassisians arise spontaneously from the spiritual fragments of great angels destroyed while defending the celestial planes against fiendish incursions. In mcases, the lowly cassisian retains fragments of its previous life's memories, and friends of that old soul may visit with the cassisian to reminisce with what remains.

Cat Lord,11,outsider,warm jungles,"This dark-skinned woman's languid movements are grace personified, her sparkling eyes those of a cat.","When the gods of nature or powerful spirits desire a champion to defend the animal world, they invest a token of their power in a chosen vessel-be it animal or humanoid. Traditionally, only one animal lord for a specific animal species is active on a world at one time, although sometimes, when an extant animal lord strays from its charge or otherwise fails, the force that created it might create a replacement to send against the fallen animal lord to challenge it in a combat to the death, with the victor claiming the right to rule or a chance at redemption. An animal lord does not dwell among humanity-the wild is its domain. How an animal lord interacts with a humanoid society largely depends on how that society treats the animals of that lord's affinity. Societies that honor and respect those animals, even if they use the animals as a food source, earn the animal lord's  respect, but those who abuse or otherwise harm animals of that lord's species find a powerful and ardent enemy in the lord. The cat lord above uses a leopard as the base animal- this particular cat lord represents a newly created animal lord. The longer an animal lord exists, the higher its level should be. CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD ""Animal Lord"" is an inherited template that can be added to humanoid of 10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal , referred to hereafter as the base animal. CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal  +2. Alignment: Any neutral.

Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of the base animal's defensive abilities in both of its forms. Speed: An animal lord's base speed is that of its base creature form or its base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary. Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal. An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat, but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat options as well. Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It also gains abilities determined by its species affinity . Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all of these ability scores by +4. Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal's racial modifiers to skill checks. Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities. Change Shape : An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal form. When an animal lord in humanoid form uses the base animal's defensive abilities, movement types, attacks, and other features, the animal lord's body instantaneously changes as appropriate to allow the use of that ability, growing wings or claws or fangs as necessary. The animal lord can use this ability to take the shape of the base animal  as a move action. Dominion : In both forms, an animal lord is treated as if constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell, but this only applies to creatures of the animal lord's species affinity . In addition, an animal lord can cast charm animal on animal of its affinity as a spell-like ability at will .

Caterprism,6,outsider,Elemental Plane of Earth,This creature looks like a crystalline caterpillar.,"A caterprism is from the Elemental Plane of Earth. It resembles a caterpillar made of crystal with hexagonal body segments and twelve sharply angled legs. Each body segment is about 2 feet long and contains a single pair of legs. The head of a caterprism is caterpillar-like, with large faceted eyes and huge mandibles. Although caterprisms prefer to consume the rich minerals of their home plane, they sometimes wander through natural portals into the Material Plane. There, they create long, winding tunnels as they eat their way through the solid rock. Dwarves have been known to bring caterprisms under some degree of control, using them to help carve out new mines and dwelling places. If it feels threatened, a caterprism's first action is to shoot at its opponents with its crystalline silk-like secretions. It then closes to bite, or rears up and stabs at opponents with the first four of its razor sharp legs. A caterprism can eat through 1 foot of solid stone per minute, leaving behind a permanent tunnel 5 feet in diameter. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",2400

As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most competent  member of that tribe. Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise.

Catoblepas,12,magical beast,swamps,"This ugly creature has a boar-like head with short antlers, a thick bullish body covered in spines, and cloven hooves on its stumpy legs.","The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times, willing to knock down trees, fences, even small houses to eat whatever it finds interesting, be that meal plant or animal or human being. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been known to forage in plains and forests for short periods before returning to the buoyant support of waters and mud. Few creatures linger near a catoblepas's feeding ground because of the monster's bad temper and poisonous breath, and only rot-loving predators such as oozes or exceptionally large otyughs have interest in hunting them. A catoblepas' primary motivation is hunting and exerting its dominance over lesser creatures in its territory. Easily detected by its foul odor, the creature tolerates the presence of wild animals, humanoid tribes, and even predators that it can bully as long as these things flee or act submissive when the poisonous brute lumbers into view. The catoblepas is known to engage in physical battles with other Large swamps creatures such as crocodiles or even froghemoths. Some humanoid tribes claim to know techniques to domesticate a catoblepas for use as a guard animal, but the monster's intractable nature and not insignificant intelligence almost certainly means magic is involved, as the creature has little need for alliances and can wipe out entire villages with its breath. Some have been known to use their breath underwaters, creating a churning cloud of bubbles that kills fish in the area and starves out other creatures. A catoblepas's sense of smell is blunted by its own ungodly stench, and it can't easily recognize rival odors such as skunk musk . A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.",19200

Caulborn,7,outsider,extraplanar,"This humanoid creature is hairless, its pale skin congealed into plates. A tight, smooth hood of skin covers the space where its eyes would be, and the bottom of its face expands into two mouths-the top one small and man-like, the lower an oversized monstrosity with split jaws that stretch out like mandibles. The first two fingers on each hand are hideously elongated and multi-jointed.","A race of telepathic prophets and historians, the strange creatures known as the caulborn wander the planes in search of new ideas, memories, and concepts to add to the pulsating, bloated brain-sacks that serve as their collective memories. Habitat and Society While extremely rare, caulborn can be found all across the planes, towing their fleshy memory banks through the Astral and Ethereal realms or setting up colonies on inhabited worlds, studying the native inhabitants for millennia before moving on. This seeming lack of a native home has given rise to numerous theories about the creatures' origin, from conjecture that they come from yet-uncharted worlds on the Material Plane to speculation that they're actually angels from the far future, come back to survey and catalogue the multiverse before its eventual destruction. If the caulborn themselves know their origin, they refuse to weigh in on the matter. On the surface, caulborn society looks much like that of other humanoids, as individual members go about the daily tasks of building structures and providing for the colony. Yet in msenses, a group of caulborn is a single organism. Members' telepathic communication and thought-sharing are so complete as to make them individual avatars of a hive mind-albeit ones who can leave and join a new hive if they need to. This ability to move between hives is crucial, as it allows the transfer of tremendous amounts of data. Any colony of substantial size contains one of the vaguely sentient brain-sacks that store the memories of individual caulborn and act as telepathic hubs for their colonies, and protecting this living library is colony members' foremost priority. These brain-sacks, which are usually given names and treated with great respect, have a telepathic range of up to a mile, helping them to organize and unify their kindred. Caulborn interactions with outsiders vary wildly. Though their alien thought processes and apparent transcension of morality make them unnerving and dangerous, their vast wealth of information and knack for prophecy position them as oracles of the highest order- provided the petitioners can offer something in return. Similarly, though the caulborn feed on sentient creatures, this feeding does not need to be harmful, and most caulborn prefer symbiotic relationships to predatory ones. Ecology The caulborn are literally creatures of the mind: their bodies are self-sustaining, and they exist solely to record and catalogue new thoughts, concepts, and experiences, no matter how trivial. Yet because of some evolutionary fluke, their own thoughts and experiences are unable to fill this need, as they lack the nourishing psychic energy possessed by other creatures. To this end, the caulborn have grown into perfect parasites-master scholars with no work of their own, only the aggregated knowledge of a thousand sentient meals. A caulborn cannot even learn a new skill on its own, as its neural pathways are designed to receive information pre-digested by another mind. All caulborn have two mouths: a human-sized, mostly vestigial mouth for respiration and vocalizing, and a terrifying, fanged set of split jaws for fighting and feeding. Neither is attached to a digestive system; rather, a caulborn's fighting mouth and its over-long index and middle fingers are the areas through which thoughts are absorbed. All caulborn are blind; the shape of their heads suggests that the creatures possessed eyes earlier in their evolution, but such organs have since been rendered obsolete by the creatures' psychic abilities, and they make no effort to remove the fleshy cowls that grow down over their faces. Reproduction for the caulborn is a hermaphroditic affair, with every colony member being fertilized by every other in a sacred, silent ritual to ensure genetic diversity. Their young are born inside large placental sacks, where they grow for months before emerging as adults. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn construct a new brainsack and seed it with every fact and record the creatures have collected since the dawn of time, usually copying knowledge over from previously established brainsacks. These protoplasmic data centers are made by dismantling the bodies of several caulborn and melding them together into a single blob of fluid and curd. This process robs the brain-sacks of senses or traces of identity but vastly increases their capacity for storage and information processing. It's through these strange god-minds, fed by regurgitated psychic energy and left with nothing but the ability to store and analyze information, that the caulborn are able to extrapolate from trends and make connections that result in the uncannily accurate predictions other races see as prophecy-a foresight challenging that of the gods themselves.",3200

Cave Fisher,2,vermin,underground,"This man-sized, crab-like monstrosity clings tenaciously to the rough stone, its enormous pincers held out menacingly before it.","The cave fisher is a highly specialized predator that dwells in caves. The creature's mode of hunting is unique-it clambers up a cave wall to settle on a ledge or in a crack, typically at a height of at least 30 feet. Ledges overlooking bridges and lower ledges overlooking chasms are favored hunting grounds for the cave fisher. The creature lies in wait until prey approaches within 60 feet, at which point it extrudes a thin cord of silk at blinding speed, lashing at the target as with a whip. The filament is incredibly sticky, and once the fisher strikes food with it, it reels in its meal to feed, trusting its position on a higher ledge to prevent allies the meal may have from molesting it as it eats. Collections of bones and lengths of discarded filaments are sure signs of cave fisher habitation. A cave fisher produces its filament from glands in its body; when it reels in a victim, it generally eats the filament along with its meal. It's impossible to harvest new filaments from a dead cave fisher, but filaments harvested from living ones are incredibly light and strong, functioning as silk rope once the sticky adhesive on a length decomposes . A cave fisher's filament glands are useful in constructing sovereign glue and similar sticky magical items. A single cave fisher's glands count as 100 gp worth of raw materials, offsetting the total cost of the item's final creation. Although cave fishers have msuperficial similarities to crabs, they do not fare well in waters and aren't very good swimmers. Nevertheless, mcave fishers lair upon ledges overlooking swift-f lowing subterranean rivers, giving them a relatively steady stream of food, especially in cases where such rivers are used as trade routes. Those who ply these rivers frequently travel with a few spare slaves or some unwanted livestock, and when they approach a known cave fisher haunt, they send down the unfortunate animal or slave on a raft to distract the monster's hunger. A cave fisher is 7 feet long and weighs 400 pounds.",600
"Cave Giant, minor",6,humanoid,underground,Bestial tusks jut from the jaw of this hunched-over giant. It is clad in armor patched together from the bones of past victims.,"Stooped over in a perpetual crouch, cave giants move as if they had never mastered walking erect. Their faces mix the worst features of ogre and feral orc. The largest would measure 10 feet in height if they ever stood straight. The typical cave giant weighs 1,000 pounds. Though few survive past 60 years, cave giants can live as long as 150 years. While they prove remarkably adept with axes of all varieties, cave giants lack the patience to work metal. What metal a cave giant possesses was likely stolen from other giants or worked by enslaved subterranean smiths. Slaves such as dwarves, orcs, and troglodytes do most of the labor in cave giant settlements. Poor treatment and the need for meat keep slave populations small and ever-rotating. New slaves are brought in whenever raiding parties remember to reign in their blood lust. Any prisoners who fail to submit to their new masters find themselves served on the dinner table or tossed screaming into the giant's cave lizard pens. Giant lizards of all types serve as both guard beasts and sport for the cave giants. Giant frilled lizards are rarely pets, as most cave giants opt to keep less dangerous monitor lizards instead. Kept in check only by fear and brutal beatings, such pets turn on their handlers at the first sign of weakness. At feeding time, live captives are tossed into the pens, a festive event filled with boisterous cheers and spirited betting.",2400

Its mouth is rounded and ringed with dozens of needle-like teeth.","Though not waters creatures, cave leeches are often found lairing near underground rivers, lakes, and streams. They are aggressive creatures whose sole purpose seems to be to kill and devour living creature that stumbles into their territory. Cave leeches often lair with others of their kind. Food is not shared among them, so each leech is effectively on its own when hunting prey. Quarrels over prey sometimes erupt between cave leeches lairing together; these disputes end when one of the leeches backs down or is driven away. An adult cave leech measures about 8 feet long and its whip-like tentacles are each about 6 feet long. Cave leeches are often mistaken for ordinary giant leeches, especially when at rest because the creature folds its tentacles back against its body. They also do this when waiting to strike. When a meal comes within range, the cave leech fires a tentacle out and attempts to grab its target. Grabbed prey is pulled in to the cave leech's mouth and bitten by its horrible teeth. Living creatures trapped by its tentacles are held and bitten, the leech draining blood with its bite. A victim that is completely drained of blood becomes a dried, rotting husk and its body is cast aside.

Those that dwell in forestsed areas build their lairs among the thick underbrush while those found in more mountains regions inhabit deep caves. A pride consists of one or more families and a family consists of at least one male and a number of females and cubs. Cave lions are carnivores. Their diet ranges from small rodents to large herd animals . Females are the primary hunters and do their hunting during either the day or night. When food is scarce, cave lions feed on carrion. This often leads to confrontations with hyenas and other such creatures. Such confrontations end when the cave lion or its opponent backs down and leaves the area. These animals mate once per year . Females always mate with the dominant male in the pride, though if one is unavailable she mates with all other males. Gestation lasts about four months after which time a litter of 1d2+1 cubs are born. They leave the den and go on their own around two years of age and reach maturity about four years of age. Cave lions live to be about ten years old. Cave lions grow to a length of 14 feet and weigh in excess of 900 pounds, though the typical cave lion is about ten feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. They have a broad face and rounded ears, and unlike common lions, neither males nor females, possess a mane. They range in color from dark yellowish-brown to gold. Mhave a mottled coat with darker spots of brown or gray. Their underbellies are lighter in color, even white on some species. Eyes vary from green to gold to brown. Their mouths are lined with rows of sharp teeth and oversized canines measuring about five inches in length. Cave lions hunt in pairs or groups. They use their Stealth skill to stay out of sight of prey and wait for it to pass by. When potential prey moves within range, the lionesses sprint from their hiding place and pounce. Often, one lioness charges and bites, attempting to pin its prey while the other cave lionesses attack relentlessly with their bite attacks. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and devoured by all cave lions. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400
Cave Moray,2,magical beast,underground,"The creature is a brownish-gray, slug-like creature about 5 feet long and 1 foot thick. Its eyes are dark brown and bulbous.","Cave morays make their lairs underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or natural occurring caves, usually near corridors, hallways or other areas of high traffic. Its lair is a burrow, just large enough for its body dug into the walls. Only one cave moray inhabits each burrow. A typical cave moray cluster contains an equal number of males and females, while a colony is often contains more females than males. Even so, the male cave moray dominates the colony. Mating occurs in the warmer months of the year with a gestation period of about 6 months. Young are born live and depend completely on their mother for nourishment and food until they are about 8 months old. A cave moray is a carnivore and its diet consists of whatever it can kill. Prey is devoured immediately and never stored or saved for later. A typical adult cave moray can go a month or more without eating. A cave moray's favored tactic is to lie in wait in its cyst-like burrow in the wall and attack whenever prey passes nearby. Two or more cave morays usually strike in unison, one from each side of a passage. After an attack, a cave moray recoils into its cyst to strike again.

Cave Troll,4,humanoid,underground,"This ugly humanoid appears to be about 6 feet tall. Its leathery skin is blackish-gray and its eyes are yellow. It has long, upright ears, almost elven in nature. Its arms and legs are long and slender and end in wicked-looking claws.","Cave trolls are smaller cousins of the normal troll and are found in all types of subterranean realms. They are as deadly, or more so, than their larger brethren. Cave trolls have the same voracious appetite of the normal troll and sustain themselves on whatever they can find in their Underdark realms. They rarely venture to the surface world, preferring the security and tranquility of the darkness they inhabit. If extremely hungry or if food is scarce, however, a cave troll ventures to the surface and attacks whatever it finds near its lair. Cave trolls stand 6 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds. Cave trolls do not walk with the same hunched gait of their larger relatives. They stand upright and move with blinding speed. Cave trolls often use deception when they first encounter prey, especially intelligent prey. Their troll heritage often leads to the misconception that they are slow in combat, which they gladly allow their opponents to believe - until the cave troll strikes or moves. Only then is the ruse negated and the true nature of the troll revealed. Cave trolls attack by grabbing and rending an opponent. Cave Troll Characters Cave troll characters possess the following racial traits. +4 Strength, +12 Dexterity, +10 Constitution, -4 Intelligence , -2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma.

Cavern Lizard,4,magical beast,underground,"A 10-foot long gray lizard with large wide feet and sapphire-gold bulging eyes stares. Balanced upon thick and muscled, its feet cling to surfaces upon small suction cup-like pads. Its head is angular and somewhat flat and its mouth sports a row of long, serrated teeth.","These large magical lizards, readily identified by large bulging sapphirecolored eyes, are found only in the darkest underground places and never venture to the surface world. A cavern lizard is typically very aggressive and often travels far away from its lair in order to hunt. While not territorial, a cavern lizard is rarely encountered with others of its kind. Each cavern lizard often has a hunting ground covering up to 2 miles in the Under Realms. A cavern lizard's lair is a large expanse of interconnected caves littered with the bones and scattered remains of its victims . Hunting cavern lizards usually drag their kill back to their lair before devouring it. If young are present in the lair, the kill is divided between them. Young cavern lizards resemble their adult counterparts in all respects, save their eyes are a dull blue. During mating season  1d6 eggs may be found in the lair. Eggs are round in shape, leathery to the touch, and gray in color. Cavern lizards are aggressive ambush hunters. They prefer to scale the walls and wait for prey to pass underneath them where they drop down on their unsuspecting meal. In most battles, once a cavern lizard bites, it hangs on until its opponent is dead. If facing more than one foe, it won't employ this tactic so as not to leave itself defenseless against other aggressors. If cornered or extremely hungry, a cavern lizard fights to the death; otherwise it retreats if it is facing a particularly powerful opponent. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Cayhound,5,outsider,any,This reddish-colored mastiff stands eye to eye with most dwarves. Within its powerful frame rumbles the distant sound of thunder.,"Cayhounds, also called leap dogs, are good-aligned outsiders who exemplify strength and freedom. They are descendants of Thunder, the pet mastiff of the Accidental God, Cayden Cailean, who uplifted his faithful companion upon achieving his own apotheosis. Thunder sired the entire cayhound race  on the golden fields of Elysium. Cayhounds are filled with wild and turbulent forces barely contained within their canine shapes. They are intelligent and feel true lust for and joy in life, including righteous battle, good food, and strong drink. These fiery red hounds stand head to chest with most humans and weigh approximately 250 pounds. Wild as they are, the cayhounds are still more good-aligned than they are chaotic. Like their true master, they are great champions of freedom, and they channel his strength and courage  in opposing nefarious schemes wherever they find them. Some ally themselves with azatas, supporting good crusades against the Outer Planes.

A cecaelia's humanoid upper body varies individually but generally ref lects the features of the inhabitants of the adaptive trait, akin to an octopus's natural camouf lage, allowing cecaelias to mutate within one to two generations to blend in with humanoids sharing their territory. Cecaelia stand 6 feet tall on land, and weigh just over 200 pounds. They generally live to be 60 years old. Cecaelias don't normally wear clothes, but often carry woven seaweed backpacks. They prefer not to wear armor, though when they do, they prefer light, flexible varieties. Tattoos are a common form of decoration as well. Cecaelias are inquisitive creatures, but wary of strangers, and are quickly frustrated by wordy attempts at diplomacy-which they nearly always view as attempts at deception. As allies, they can be valuable to coastlines communities since they often dig up treasures from the seabed that they then trade for fragments of polished glass or bits of ""land fare,"" as they refer to food not taken from the sea.",1600
Centaur,3,monstrous humanoid,temperate forests or plains,This creature has the sun-bronzed upper body of a seasoned warrior and the lower body of a sleek warhorse.,"Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs are part man and part horse. Typically found on the fringes of civilization, these stoic people vary widely in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend toward darker colors and their features tend to be broad, while the overall bulk of their bodies is inf luenced by the size of the horses their lower quarters resemble. Thus, while an average centaur stands over 7 feet tall and weights upward of 2,000 pounds, there are vast regional variations-from lean plains-runners to burly mountains hunters. Centaurs typically live to be about 60 years old. Aloof with other races and at odds even with their own kind, the centaurs are an old race only slowly coming to accept the modern world. While the majority of centaurs still live in tribes roaming vast plains or the fringes of eldritch forests, mhave abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to walk among the more cosmopolitan cities of the world. Often such free-spirited centaurs are considered outcasts and are shunned by their own tribes, making the decision to leave a heavy one. In some rare cases, however, whole tribes under progressive leaders have come to trade or make alliances with other humanoid communities-typically elves, but sometimes gnomes, and rarely humans or dwarves. Mraces remain wary of centaurs, though, largely due to legends of territorial beastmen and the regular, violent encounters the centaurs have with stubborn settlers and expansionist countries.",800

Cephalophore,8,construct,any,"Holding its own severed head in its hands, this marble statue looms forbiddingly over what it protects.","Adventurers wandering among forgotten ruins, abandoned temples, or moldering graveyards may have a chance encounter with an enigmatic cephalophore standing watch over the site. At a cursory glance, these guardians appear to be looming statues of decapitated humanoids, their severed heads held aloft in a gruesome warning or cradled in their hands like a precious prize. To benign passersby, these marble constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate the cephalophore's holy site quickly find that this seemingly immovable statue is anything but. Consequently, madventurers and tomb raiders have come to see cephalophores as a type of good-luck omen, because when one finds a cephalophore, a dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not far away. Part guard and part trap, most of these hulking figures were constructed millennia ago to stand watch over culturally vital holy sites. Cephalophores are the perfect sentinels-they remain completely still, without fatigue or complaint, for centuries, until a specific set of circumstances triggers them. These triggers are far from universal, and each individual cephalophore has a different set of transgressions that it is constitutionally bound to prevent. For many, it's the perturbation of certain relics within its tomb or temple, but some cephalophores are bound to attack who pass by without performing a now-long-forgotten ritual or incantation. A typical cephalophore stands 10 to 15 feet tall and weighs up to 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at best. Ecology Cephalophores are intimately linked to specific tombs or temples, with each constructed to stand guard over a single location. While the ravages of time do little to diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, the sacred edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages. Consequently, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness, standing vigilant guard over a site that has been long forgotten by mortal society. Mcephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked junglesfoliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns. Not entirely immune to aging, cephalophores do decay very slowly, their marmoreal forms flaking and crumbling over centuries. This process is hastened in climates where exposure to local weather conditions is especially ruinous or erosive. It is for this reason that the majority of intact cephalophores are discovered in arid climates or enclosed habitats like caves or catacombs. This leads some to mistakenly believe these creatures prefer such environs. In reality, preference has nothing to do with it-they are simply better preserved in dry conditions. Cephalophores subjected to centuries of high winds or dripping waters sometimes deteriorate into featureless columns, the details of their forms washing away with the elements. Consequently, those having come in contact with a malformed cephalophore often chalk up the encounter to a spiteful earth elemental, and have no idea how close they were to an ancient treasure trove or forgotten tomb. Habitat & Society Designed to perform a single, lonely function and constructed to be mindless, cephalophores are not at all social creatures. Any vestige of identity the constructs have is left over from their makers, who designed them in accordance with the aesthetics of their own cultures. Most scholars of Golarion suspect the first cephalophores were constructed during the height of the ancient city of Ninshabur in present-day Casmaron, whose inf luence extended as far west as Ancient Osirion and present-day Taldor. These scholars also posit that the cephalophores were made in an attempt by the Ninshaburians to emulate the living monoliths of Osirion, with whom Ninshaburian phalanxes were likely to have come into contact. The Ninshaburian origins of the cephalophores are evidenced by both their appearance and their geographic locations. One obvious indicator of the cephalophores' link to Ninshabur is the facial characteristics of the animate statues. Mof the constructs feature stylistically arched eyebrows and ferocious grimaces, in keeping with the characteristics of mknown Ninshaburian statues of lammasus and sphinxes. Further, the locations of known cephalophore sites are consistent with the territory of the once-inf luential empire. Though the highest concentration of cephalophores is undoubtedly in eastern Qadira, they have also been encountered throughout Andoran, Cheliax, Galt, Isger, Varisia, and even Nex in eastern Garund. Mof these territories were never officially conquered by the marauding Ninshaburians, but it's possible some of their cultural practices and techniques spread to other societies, prompting a variety of sects to create their own cephalophores. Scholars debate whether ancient cephalophores were originally statues, chiseled from stone and then imbued with deadly purpose, or whether they were once living creatures that were immortalized through some forgotten ritual. If it's true that the Ninshaburians were inspired by the divine guardians of Osirion, then it's likely both methods were used at different times. Rock carvings found in the abandoned temple complex of Tabsagal indicate that the characteristic decollation of cephalophores was tied to a ritual wherein highly venerated holy warriors  were offered near-immortality in exchange for their service to Ninshabur. The majority of the ritual seems to have consisted of oath-taking, wherein the terms of the heroes' guardianship were made clear. However, to seal the pact, these warriors were then required to offer their own heads in homage to their ancient gods. After their beheading, the soldiers' bodies rapidly turned to stone, and they were then moved to their eternal resting places as guardians of Ninshabur's holiest sites. A cephalophore's grisly pose is a perfect representation of the self-sacrificial zealotry of Ninshaburian warriors. Those who chose to become Ninshabur's longstanding holy guards forsook all freedom and everlasting rest to ensure that their empire's sacred artifacts remained unmolested. Those who would stir the dust of Ninshabur must risk the wrath of these ever-watchful martyrs and the single-minded dedication that drives them.

Ceratioidi,3,monstrous humanoid,saltwaters,"This flabby, fish-like humanoid has the wide mouth, bulging eyes, and dangling, luminescent flesh lure of a deep-sea predator. Powerful arms end in webbed hands that each clutch barbed hunting spears, and a tumorous bulge protrudes from the back of its neck.","Rulers of the deep oceans trenches, ceratioidi are powerful, intelligent humanoids who share several unusual traits with the waters predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of influence far and wide, using their alien intelligence, natural affinity for magic, and hypnotizing lures to manipulate other creatures throughout Golarion's oceans-and beyond. Ecology Perhaps the strangest aspect of the ceratioidi is that each individual is in fact two entities-a powerful, imposing female and a rat-sized, parasitic male. Averaging 7 feet tall and weighing roughly 300 pounds, a female ceratioidi's fleshy body belies both its tremendous strength and its startling intelligence. Males, though equally intelligent, appear to outside observers to be nothing more than fish with vaguely anthropomorphic faces. Born from ribbon-like egg clusters, ceratioidi mature quickly and are ready to mate when 1 year old. During the mating ritual, the tiny male ceratioidi affixes itself to the back of a female's neck and begins secreting an enzyme that dissolves both creatures' skin and transforms them into a single unit. Within a few weeks, what was two creatures has become one-though each retains its own independent consciousness, the male joins his respiration, digestion, and other biological functions with those of the female, becoming nothing more than a bulging organ on his partner's back. While unintelligent angler fish use similar methods in order to self-fertilize at will, a ceratioidi male retains independent thought, and the two linked entities remain in constant telepathic communication, using their combined mental faculties to excel at wizardry and maintain absolute physical precision in combat. This uniquely divided mental structure also makes it easy for ceratioidi to study multiple fields or callings, such as the powerful witch/wizard combination that is their trademark, though it's also common for them to act as underwaters rangers. In addition to their dual nature, ceratioidi share a number of other intimidating characteristics with their angler fish cousins. Along with its wide mouth full of inward-curving, needle-sharp teeth, a ceratioidi also possesses the angler fish's fleshy forehead lure, called an esca. This bioluminescent blob dangles at the end of thin spine just above eye level and is the focus for the ceratioidi's innate hypnotic abilities. Through this lure, the ceratioidi can paralyze foes in combat, forcing them to stand still or approach and be culled by the ceratioidi's barbed fishing spear; it can even hypnotize creatures so thoroughly as to make them susceptible to subliminal commands. This ability to manipulate others, combined with the immobile male's natural affinity for magical study and other deeply contemplative arts, makes the ceratioidi masters of their surroundings. Though almost all ceratioidi encountered outside of their homes are fully mated pairs, unmated females can be represented by removing the dual mind ability from the creature's stat block. Males can be simulated by using the statistics for an electric eel without the electricity special ability. Habitat & Society Because they normally construct their cities on the floors of deep oceans trenches or near mineral-rich underwaters vents, ceratioidi are rarely encountered by terrestrial races, and little is known about their society save for one region-the tiny nation of Outsea in the rivers Kingdoms. Long ago, in an effort to use Avistan's rivers system to circle around their merfolk enemies in a daring military campaign, a group of ceratioidi mercenaries made it all the way up the Sellen before their magic gave out, trapping the ceratioidi and a number of other saltwaters races-both friend and foe-in a patch of magically contained brine deep in the heart of the rivers Kingdoms. Left with no choice but cooperation or death, the various waters races pooled their resources and created the isolated community of Outsea, a town existing both above and below the watersline where terrestrial creatures trade with the trapped but still powerful waters denizens. The ceratioidi, with their manipulative magic and ability to exist on land for long stretches of time, make perfect gobetweens and bureaucrats for the strange kingdom. Though the ceratioidi are rumored by mto be a product of aboleth experimentation, the ceratioidi of Outsea believe differently. They believe themselves to be the direct descendents of their god-ruler Danglosa, an immense and omnipotent angler fish that accompanied them on their journey and now resides in the flooded caverns deep below Outsea. Though never seen, its presence is felt regularly through the actions of the Called-""blessed"" individuals suddenly overcome with an all-consuming desire to swim downward and join their dualistic god, never to be seen again. The ceratioidi's distinct resemblance to the kingdom's mysterious leader is just one more reason why the ceratioidi, though in the minority, remain powerful figures in Outsea.",800
Cerberi,6,outsider,any,"Every strip of this three-headed hound's hide has been peeled away, leaving wet sinew and bulging tendons exposed.","The mythical watchdogs of Hell, cerberi bear the bodies of terrible, powerful hounds combined with the essences of fiends. Relied upon by villains and frightful beings as guardians and jailers, these three-headed canine abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, packlike communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly throngs, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws, as befits their infernal nature.

If slain, the soul is immediately devoured by Cerberus and is lost forever. Cerberus is also tasked with keeping living creatures out of the land of the dead . Living creatures that attempt to move past Cerberus into Hades  are immediately attacked. Cerberus is a 30-foot long black mastiff.

When it detects its prey, the stalker bursts through the ground in a shower of rock and earth, cocoons its victim and disappears into the ground to devour the victim's brain. The lair of a cerebral stalker is a large, hollow chamber of earth, often littered with skull fragments, bits of webbing, and chunks of brain matter. Cerebral stalkers are solitary creatures and do not work in concert with others of their kind. They attack those of their own race if another attempts to take up residence in an area already inhabited by a cerebral stalker . The lifespan and reproduction method of these creatures is completely unknown. The cerebral stalker prefers to attack from ambush, hiding just below the surface of the ground where it uses its tremorsense ability to detect creatures moving above it. When it successfully detects a creature, it violently emerges from the ground  and grabs the unsuspecting victim.

The powerful arms of a chaaor end in razor-sharp and filthy claws-black in color. Long rows of sharpened teeth fill the chaaor's mouth. When moving, the chaaor usually drops to all fours. When facing an aggressor it assumes a bipedal stance. Chaaor are deadly adversaries that relish the blood and adrenaline of battle. Their tactics are simple: target a foe, charge forward, and rake or slash with claws and bite. Often, a chaaor unleashes its mighty roar to begin a fight hoping to knock down as mfoes as possible. A downed foe is leapt on by multiple chaaors who proceed to tear the opponent to pieces. Likewise, if a chaaor grabs a foe, it holds on while the others move in and rip it to shreds with teeth and claws. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",12800
Chain Worm,12,vermin,land or underground,"This creature looks like a massive centipede with a bright, reflective silver carapace. Its legs are dull silver and its oversized mandibles are black. A dull black stinger is located at the rear of its body.","Chain worms are subterranean predators with an insatiable appetite for meat. The creature has a particular fondness for dwarf, gnome, and bugbear flesh. Chain worms often build their nests near communities of these creatures so their food supply is readily available. Though not particularly fond of cold or damp weather, a chain worm can be found just about anywhere as its chitinous body offers it ample protection against less than friendly environments. A chain worm's nest is a hole or tunnel littered with rocks, bones, refuse, and debris, and often located on a rocky outcropping or ledge making it inaccessible to most creatures. Any valuables found in its lair are simply the remains of a previous meal that the chain worm couldn't digest or didn't bother eating. Chain worms stand nearly 6 feet tall and are about 10 feet long with silver carapaces and dull silver legs. Their heads sport oversized dull black mandibles that constantly drip brownish-gray saliva. Its tail stinger is about a foot long and black . A chain worm lies in wait for a meal, attacking whenever its target comes within range. It attacks using either a nasty bite or by curling its rear body forward and stinging with its tail stinger. If a chain worm grabs a foe in its mandibles, it holds it and repeatedly stings it until it is dead. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",19200
Chalkydri,14,outsider,good-aligned plane,This angelic-looking creature resembles a muscular humanoid with coppery skin and coppery eyes. It has four large feathery wings of white and carries a longsword swathed in fire.,"Chalkydris spend most of their time on the Ethereal or Astral Plane or on one of the mElemental Planes, usually acting on behalf of some deity of good. Chalkydris are militaristic and often lead small retinues of other celestials against the infernal armies. When not serving in such roles, they are found acting as protectors or escorts to visitors on the good-aligned planes. Sometimes, a chalkydri is sent to the Material Plane by its deity to watch over a favored worshipper. When traveling the Material Plane, the chalkydri often takes a form more acceptable to humanoids. Chalkydris appear as powerful, agile humans 6 to 7 feet tall with coppery skin, red or blonde hair, and copper-colored eyes. Two sets of large feathery wings  protrude from their back at shoulder level. Their wings are glossy white with copper tips. Chalkydris wear tunics or robes of varying colors, usually crimson, copper, green, silver, or gold. Chalkydris enjoy combat and one is never without its +2 flaming longsword and at least two +2 flaming javelins. A chalkydri opens combat by hurling one of its javelins at a foe before moving into melee to battle with its longsword. While in combat, it utilizes its spell-like abilities to their fullest extent. If a chalkydri is overwhelmed in battle, it summons celestials to its aid or uses its plane shift ability to escape. If slain, the chalkydri's weapons explode in a blinding flash of fire.

Changeling,0.5,humanoid,any,"This young woman has a slender frame and a beautiful face, yet there's something vaguely unnerving about her appearance. Her skin is unnaturally pale, her hair is dark, and each of her eyes is a different color.","Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents, changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most do not know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she cannot identify. Changelings are always female, tall, and slender. A changeling's hair is typically dark and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father's race. A frequent but not universal trait of changelings is their mismatched, different-colored eyes. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds. Ecology When a hag of sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually eaten or killed by his partner before he can see the offspring, or else flees the area in shame upon discovering the true nature of his lover, and the hag herself interacts with the child just long enough to set it on the stoop of some unsuspecting family or temple. Depending on the race of her father, a changeling can resemble type of humanoid, including dwarves, gnomes, and even orcs and goblins. A changeling and her new family are never aware of the strange child's true parents, but in most cases everyone involved is keenly aware that there is something odd about the frail child with the ghostly pallor. Even the young girl herself can easily see that she possesses abilities others do not-powers that are subtle at younger ages and only truly begin to manifest themselves when she reaches adolescence. It is around puberty that the changeling begins to hear what hags refer to as ""the call,"" a hypnotic, spiritual voice that only she can hear and that beckons her to travel. To where, the changeling does not know, but the underlying prospect of finding out her true origins is often enough to drive the girl to seek out the source of this mystical voice. The voice is in fact that of the changeling's birth mother, who forms a coven with two others hags in order to summon her child back to her, now that she is old enough to fully transform into a hag. This transformative ritual is a barbaric one that only the most determined changelings willingly go through; upon arriving at the coven, it is usually too late to turn back for changelings who were merely drawn to the voice by curiosity. Those who seek power, however, identify with the hags, and happily go through the ordeal in order to unlock their dormant abilities. Regardless of her desires, though, a changeling who has undergone the transformation cannot go back; once she becomes a hag, she remains a hag, and her mind turns as wicked as her form has turned hideous. Changelings who ignore the call eventually cease to hear it. In this case, a hag mother sometimes disguises herself and ventures into civilization, seeking out her daughter. If she finds her, she lures the girl back to the coven, where she can perform the ritual of transformation. The process of performing the call or physically retrieving the changeling is taxing, though, and mhags find it easier to simply lure in another mate and birth another changeling in hopes that this one will heed the evertantalizing call. Habitat & Society Raised wherever she will be accepted, a changeling has no real say in the habitat she grows up in. Families who inadvertently raise changelings often react in one of two ways toward the strange child's development of supernatural powers: they either embrace the girl, nurturing her and her gift, or they disown her as an abomination, casting her out into a world of loneliness and resentment. Of course, this reaction to her power often has a huge inf luence over the changeling's course of action as a young adult. Changelings who are accepted by their adopted society often don't see the need to follow their mothers' voices, instead using their powers for their own ends, whereas shunned individuals almost always answer the call and become treacherous hags with embittered hearts and shattered souls. Hags usually prefer to mate with the prevalent and fecund humans of Golarion, producing changelings that resemble humans. Changelings of other races do occur, but their attitude and outlook are much more dependent on the attitudes of their adoptive parents than on their racial background. Changelings rarely band together with other changelings, as hags only seldom allow their unions to result in offspring, and changelings encountering others of their type may never recognize their shared origins. Thus, the abandoned offspring graft themselves into whatever society will accept them, adapting to new roles with remarkable ease. If a changeling chooses to heed the call that beckons her as a young woman, she quickly finds herself in an entirely different sort of society: hags, though accepting of their own brood, are quite unlike other creatures, and their form of culture is so primitive and evil that it can hardly be called culture at all. A changelingturned- hag follows the same patterns as her mother and other brethren, eventually charming an unwitting suitor and creating a changeling offspring of her own, repeating the vicious cycle. Having no innate predisposition toward evil, a changeling's values are solely a product of her environment, and given individual is just as likely to perform evil as she is to act righteously. Often, though, a changeling's slightly unusual appearance marks her as the target for harassment, potentially leading her toward a vengeful path. Any means of releasing innate magical energy is good enough for the changeling, and mbecome witches. Changeling Characters Changelings are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the following racial traits. -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Changelings are frail, but possess a sharp wit and unnatural beauty. Hag Trait: A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the type of hag her mother is. Hulking Changeling: A changeling who was born of an annis hag is much more physically formidable than other changelings. You receive a +1 trait bonus on damage you inf lict with a melee attack. Green Widow: A changeling of green hag descent is naturally able to lure in potential mates and effectively trick them into pursuing her. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks made against characters that might be sexually attracted to you. Sea Lungs: A changeling with a sea hag mother can survive underwaters for longer than usual. You gain the ability to hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to three times your Constitution score instead of two. Claws: A changeling's hands and fingernails tend to harden and become sharp as she reaches adolescence. This gives her the claw  natural attack. Natural Armor: Hags and their offspring have uncommonly tough skin. A changeling begins play with a natural armor bonus of +1. Darkvision: Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Languages: Changelings begin play speaking the primary language of their host society and Common. Changelings who have high Intelligence scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Orc.",200
Chaos Beast,7,outsider,any,"This thing is a horrid mass of barbed tentacles, glaring eyes, and gnashing teeth, twisting upon itself and reshaping into new forms.","A chaos beast's form changes without goal or purpose. Though at particular second a chaos beast may appear to have dozens of limbs, whether claws, tentacles, stingers, and so on, the lightning-quick shifts of its body mean most of these are gone before it has a chance to use them, and its attacks are always treated as claws regardless of the creature's appearance.",3200
Charau-Ka,2,humanoid,warm forests,"This limber, shrieking creature has the visage of an enraged monkey, but it walks upright like a man.","Although they call themselves the charau-ka, these dangerous junglesdwellers are often known to colonists and explorers as ape-men. Legend holds that the charau-ka stem from the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the bodies of the first humans that tried to wage war against his cult, causing the dead to rise as the first apemen. Rumors that charau-ka clerics have perfected a hideous ritual to force those slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among junglesexplorers-but proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization. Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races of creatures in the Mwangi Expanse. Not all of them serve the Gorilla King or worship Angazhan; some have become feral monsters little more organized than apes, while others may have turned to the worship of other demon lords or even the snake-god Ydersius. Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous junglescreatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their druids or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical charau-ka village extends from the junglesfloor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.",600
Charda,7,monstrous humanoid,cold waters or underground,"Armored in dense, bony plates, this four-armed creature drools wretched strings of black bile from its fanged maw.","In the darkest depths of the earth, in strange frozen rivers and subterranean lakes of frigid black waters dwell the mysterious and ferocious chardas. These xenophobic humanoids rarely venture far from their domains, settling in small tribes and building rocky huts underwaters or muddy domes along the subterranean shore. A typical charda stands just under 4 feet tall but weighs 250 pounds. Chardas reproduce by laying eggs in small clutches of two to four, which they bury among rocks offshore. Females fiercely protect their own clutches, but show no predisposition toward protecting the clutches of other chardas, even those within their tribe. Devoutly religious, chardas prefer to worship gods of war or cold. They hunt in small packs composed of both males and females. Hunting and slaying help determine an individual's power within the group. Chardas often engage in infanticide and cannibalism. While they patrol their territories in groups, they fight individually with little strategy or structure. Chardas do not assist each other with their kills, as they perceive aid as a weakness and a dishonor to both themselves and their foes.",3200
Charnel Colossus,19,undead,any,"This horror is composed of dozens, if not hundreds, of decomposing cadavers held together as an amalgamated whole.","Some dead don't rest easy because of the circumstances of their death or the horrific experiences they underwent in life. Their souls return to the world of the living demanding justice, revenge, or just wanton destruction. Some dead, however, never intended for their souls to leave. Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus. A charnel colossus is an amalgam of scores, even hundreds, of individuals who, upon death, chose to be interred under special ritual circumstances with others of like mind. This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library-if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred-often over a period spanning hundreds of years-creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror. The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable-the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim's own life experience. The colossus can also form two thin tendrils of this charnel stuff in order to lash out and draw prey into its embrace. As powerful, ever-hungering abominations, charnel colossi are thankfully few and far between. The only documented one currently known to exist is reported to be trapped beneath the ruins of Kalexcourt in northwestern Ustalav, in an ancient Kellid shamanistic burial site.",204800
Charon,23,outsider,"Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells, or Tarterus",This creature appears as a skeletal humanoid shrouded in a dark hooded robe. Small pinpoints of crimson light burn in its eye sockets and seem to function as its eyes.,"Charon spends his time ferrying dead souls to their final resting place in the Lower Planes. He uses a large, flat skiff to ferry his passengers across the dangerous waters of the rivers Styx. On occasion, he ferries living souls to a desired location within the Lower Planes, though he charges a hefty price for such passage. In order to request passage from Charon, would-be travelers must first summon him to the banks of the rivers Styx. This can be accomplished by casting blasphemy, holy word, or symbol . After casting one of the above mentioned spells, 2d4 rounds later, Charon appears on his black skiff. Travel across the rivers Styx by Charon costs 100 gp per character level per creature seeking passage. The total cost can be in magic items, coins, gems, or combination of the aforementioned items. If his price is refused, Charon turns his skiff and moves away. If attacked, Charon attacks but seeks to escape as soon as possible. Charon attacks using his spell-like abilities, gaze weapon, and staff. He attempts to throw creature who has stepped foot on his skiff without first paying his price into the rivers Styx. If combat goes against him or he seems to be overmatched, he summons other daemons to deal with the interlopers while he teleports himself and his skiff away.

Charybdis,13,aberration,oceans,"An immense spiny monster, its back plated in chitin and its belly in thick folds of blubber, rises hungrily from the center of a whirlpool.","Sailors tell mtales of the creatures of the deep, from the terrible kraken to the beautiful mermaid. Yet few are stranger or more feared than the dread charybdis, for it exists to capture ships, crack them open like nuts, and feast on the doomed sailors within. So legendary are these violent attacks that msailors have come to view the charybdis not as a species of aberrant life, but as the vengeful personification of an angry sea god. In truth, the charybdis is not the sending of an angry deity, but in fact little more than a monstrous predator capable of churning even the calmest of seas into a whirling maelstrom. The charybdis uses this vortex ability not only to capture prey like sharks or small whales, but also to entrap ships on the oceans surface above. The monster's claws are particularly well suited to puncturing the hulls of ships, and most charybdises have learned that a single large merchant vessel contains enough sailors to make a perfectly sized meal. Often, a charybdis settles in along a well-known shipping route near the shoreline or amid an archipelago of islands where ships are forced along relatively narrow lanes between rocky isles-such locations allow the charybdis to lie in wait and increases the chance of its prey being unable to circumvent its vortex. A charybdis is 60 feet long and weighs 26,000 pounds.",25600

While he burrows constantly through the Darklands to the deepest Vaults of Orv, he sometimes rises to Golarion's surface bringing annihilation in his wake, as those corrupted by his awful eye wreak devastation upon themselves and their own people.

Chemosit,4,magical beast,warm forests,"This massive, shaggy beast uses long and muscular forearms to raise itself onto its hind legs and beats its chest like a gorilla. Despite its ape-like stance, its frame is far heavier and its features more primitive, its powerful muzzle and gnashing canines bespeaking terrible, bestial savagery.","From the time their children are young, Mwangi tribesfolk tell them chillsing tales of the savage, childeating chemosit. While most believe these stories hold little truth and serve only to keep children from wandering too far from their villages, others know better. Few who have witnessed the gruesome work of the chemosit survive. Bearing terrible scars, both physical and mental, they recall the creature's utter savagery and inhuman strength. Tribes living in close proximity to chemosits believe them to be the living embodiment of wrathful gods or nature spirits, and pay them grisly sacrifices. In such places, those who suffer the beast's attacks are often blamed for the violence and exiled. In other regions, evil shamans capable of summoning or commanding these beasts gain great power and infamy. It is a common practice for warring tribes to pay such shamans to summon a chemosit to plague the villages of their enemies. Chemosits stand over 9 feet tall on average and weigh upward of 750 pounds. Ecology Chemosits  are readily identified by their thick and bristly dark-blue fur and broad, stumpy tails. Beneath their fur, coils of muscle stretch across their broad frames, and they move with ferocious confidence. Chemosits can walk upright or run on all fours, and are able climbers. A chemosit's face is a mix of simian and ursine features, with a long lower jaw and the sharp, powerful teeth of a dedicated carnivore. Perhaps its most identifiable characteristic, however, is its terrifying roar. On still nights, its grim echoes roll through the forests, leaving all who hear it sleepless with fright. Strict carnivores, chemosits go through monthly feeding cycles. During the first cycle, they barely eat, often passing the entire month without feeding. During the second cycle, they emerge as voracious predators.Chemosits hunt nocturnally, preferably on dark moonless nights. Able climbers, they often hide in trees, dropping down upon prey from great heights. They favor easy prey, such as cattle, but they consider humans a delicacy and do not hesitate to attack and devour lone travelers or small groups, their favorite morsel being the brain. Feasting upon brains invigorates chemosits, though in varying ways depending on the type of creatures they consume. Some even say that chemosits take on the knowledge and powers of creatures whose brains they ingest, a legend supported by the strange powers or behaviors exhibited by individuals that have recently gorged. Chemosits often stalk villages, entering each night by stealth and stealing away with sleeping victims, preferably children, the infirm, or others too weak to defend themselves. A small number of bold or reckless exotic animal trainers value chemosits for their hunting and tracking abilities. They pay top coin for newborns or cubs, and attempt to raise them in captivity, training them to track down and ferret out prey. A competent handler can typically train them to follow simple commands, particularly instinctive concepts like ""hunt"" and ""kill."" Most captive-bred chemosits are accomplished trackers. Once they taste fresh blood, however, they eventually turn feral; thus trainers typically attempt to get to targets before their pets. Habitat & Society Chemosits live in Mwangi's most remote and fiercest jungles, where they can find massive boab trees capable of supporting their tremendous weight. They choose regions with large trees near freshwaters supplies and, if possible, caves. For the untrained, chemosits' territory is difficult to detect. They leave behind few traces of their passing, fastidiously scratching out their tracks and burying their dung. Principally arboreal, chemosits spend the majority of their waking time climbing through the shadowy understory. Caves serve chemosits not as shelters, but as repositories for the remains of their kills. It is unknown why chemosits create such middens, though some suggest they use the scent of carrion to attract prey. Chief ly nocturnal, chemosits retire to the safety and shadows of high trees by day. Once darkness falls, the creature hunts with reckless voraciousness. Chemosits live in small patriarchal clans dominated by an alpha male. Male chemosits are solitary hunters, and establish their clan status through their kills. As they seek out larger game, particularly creatures not found in the deep forests, their hunting grounds often grow to extend beyond the borders of their clan territory. Clan members that display the largest and most impressive kills rise in status and gain access to preferred hunting grounds and mates.",1200

Two long meaty arms sprout from a hugely obese frame; its head appears to be little more than a bald sloping brow with black pits for eyes. Its maw splits open to reveal cavernous jaws, teeth glowing like huge red hot coals.","The cherum is an abomination born of intense heat and crushing despair. Often making their homes in lava sprues, they are thought to be the rejected offspring of a fire deity . As such, they are often worshipped as divine beings by primitive folk who offer virgin sacrifices to appease the ""God of the mountains."" The cherum greedily devours such gifts, demanding more and more delicate flesh to feed its insatiable appetite. A cherum's deific background subjects it to fits of rage that can be felt for miles . Though neutral by nature, cherum are often on decent terms with fire giants and other fire-based creatures that dwell near them. Though they do not trade with such creatures and rarely, if ever, aid them in time of need, they do not usually attack or demand homage from said creatures either. Cherum do not associate with dragons of sort, especially red dragons for whom they have a great hatred. A cherum stands about 70 feet tall and weighs well over 40,000 pounds. Cherum are known to climb from a pool of molten magma, stretch forth their massive arms and devour everything in their grasp. They have little fear of dragons, demons, devils, or foolish adventurers who wander too close to their lair. They seek to grab and swallow everything smaller than themselves. If a fight goes against a cherum, it attempts to flee by diving into the nearest pool of lava and wait for its aggressors to leave as it heals. Should this fail, it fights on to the death.

Chickcharney,3,magical beast,"warm forests, hills, or plains","Resembling a filthy owl with the gangly long legs of a stork, this almost comically ugly bird has piercing black eyes and emits an annoying screech.","Chelish explorers first came upon this strange magical bird during their early voyages to the Shackles. While the unusual creature was initially laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous bird has nonetheless proven to be a force to be reckoned with in its own way. A chickcharney can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch from a chickcharney's accursed beak or claws has spelled the end for countless unwary seafarers. Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most non-threatening humanoids, even accompanying them for short times and often leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate. However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or rudeness, they inf lict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them. Chickcharneys fiercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as humanoids. The shells are thought to possess alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and malchemists are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens. While some pirates of the Shackles continue to insist that encountering a chickcharney is a good omen, a much larger contingent gives the ornery and erratic bird a wide berth.

Chimera,7,magical beast,temperate hills,"This winged monster has the body of a lion, though two more heads flank its central feline one-a dragon and a horned goat.","Chimeras are monstrous creatures born of primordial evil. Hateful and hungry, they hunt on the ground or in the air. A chimera's dragon head may be of evil dragon type, with the corresponding breath weapon, and its wings usually match the scales on its head. Chimeras speak with three overlapping voices, but rarely do so, typically only when playing toady to a more powerful creature. A chimera is 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs 700 pounds. Chimeras prefer meat but can subsist on vegetable matter if necessary . Their flight means they can pick and choose their prey, and they usually hunt a large area in search of easy food. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds might give them offerings. Conversely, they are just intelligent and stubborn enough that they make poor pets, and only a significantly more powerful creature can keep them submissive. They may form equal partnerships with a respectful humanoid or similar creature, and even consent to be used as a mount. A pride of chimeras is very leonine in its hierarchy, with a dominant male leading the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A solitary chimera may be a young male or a female with cubs nearby.",3200
Choker,2,aberration,underground,"This hunched-over wretch has long, pliable arms like tentacles capped with five wide, spiny claws.","Underground predators that often dwell on the outskirts of subterranean ruins or in the deep shadows of nameless cavern outposts, chokers lurk in the darkness and lash out with their long, rubbery arms to grasp prey as it passes by. They seldom attack multiple enemies at once, stalking their quarry until they can isolate a weaker victim from its pack. Chokers walk with a disturbing, almost comical gait due to their extremely limber legs. Weighing only 35 pounds and standing no taller than a half ling, chokers have no problem skittering across walls and ceilings, often lodging themselves into shadowy corners, tunnel intersections, walls, or staircases. A choker will attempt to grasp creatures of almost size, but prefers lone prey of its size or smaller. Chokers appear to have little culture of their own, gathering only brief ly to mate before their wanderlust and hunger spurs them again to a solitary existence. Their just-better-than-animalistic intelligence grants them a fascination with the trappings of society even if they do not truly understand it. Accordingly, the grubby lair of a choker  usually contains valuable objects such as rings, brooches, cloak clasps, and loose coins gathered from devoured victims. This fascination occasionally compels a choker to abandon its subterranean home for a closer study of the sunlit world's mcivilizations. These chokers feel most at home in the darkened narrow alleyways of human cities, squeezing themselves into sewers, forgotten alcoves, barrels, and similar cramped, overlooked spaces. Chokers prefer to keep hidden during the light of day, emerging from their hidey-holes under cover of darkness to hunt for food and cruel pleasure. Favorite tactics include using their long arms to scoop prey off the street from the safety of a nearby rooftop, attacking sleeping families by squeezing through an open chimney, or tapping on a window to bring their curious food within grasping distance.",600
Choleric Ooze Swarm,2,ooze,underground,"Dozens of tiny globs of slime move on their own, acting as one being, alternately clinging to each other and separating in a riot of oozing momentum.","Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile chemicals.

Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings.

Choronzon Demon,18,outsider,any,"This creature stands at least 20 feet tall with a huge, muscular body. Its massive arms and legs end in wicked claws. Its rounded, squat head, sits atop an extremely thick, almost nonexistent neck. The creature's gaping maw is filled with sharp fangs. Two large swept back horns jut from its head just above its rounded eyes.","Choronzons are the demons of confusion, dispersion, and ultimate chaos. They are huge behemoths seemingly bred for war and battle, though most rarely take part in the Abyssal wars that rage between the planes. Choronzons prefer to use their talents on weak-minded creatures such as those that inhabit the Material planes, and as such, they are usually encountered there. These demons derive great pleasure in laying waste to villages and towns and even small kingdoms . Amongst demonkind, choronzons are both feared and hated. A great enmity exists between balors and choronzons that scholars and lorekeepers can document, but cannot determine the source of the hatred between these two demonic races. A choronzon stands about 20 feet tall and weighs about 9,000 pounds. Its scaly flesh is bluish-black and its eyes are crimson. Its horns are darker than the rest of its body and the creature's claws are pitch black. Its teeth are dull ivory in color. A choronzon begins combat by surrounding itself with its aura of confusion and then unleashing its breath weapon at its foes. Creatures surviving either attack are subjected to its word of chaos. Opponents that continue to press the battle are met with a mix of physical attacks and spell-like abilities. When it uses its Power Attack feat, a choronzon usually takes a -8 penalty on its attack rolls in order to gain a +8 bonus on its damage rolls. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",153600
Chortov,9,outsider,any,"Quivering with heat and barely restrained might, this monstrous, pig-faced titan looms taller than a city wall. Girded in fiendishly etched armor too small for its incredible corpulence, rolls of densely muscled hide spill forth in a flamered avalanche. Gnashing its many-tusked teeth and clutching a wicked military fork, the terrible giant rumbles as if preparing to roar or scream.","Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape. Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things- other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation. Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted. Ecology Not all souls damned to the depths of the Pit deserve their places therein. Trapped planar travelers, goodly souls slain as diabolical sacrifices, or captives who would otherwise face torments elsewhere upon the planes-all might become prisoners of one of Hell's inescapable layers, eternally condemned to an unfair damnation. Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror, losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm with the terrible sustenance it requires to- over the span of eons-excrete forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage. From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic, barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the chortovs. Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath, the one thing they can never strike against is their captors. Thus, while other devils stand united as zealots inspired by the will of the archdevils and Asmodeus himself, chortovs serve only because they must, suffering eternally through a second damnation. Habitat & Society Upon their grotesque creations, most chortovs find themselves stationed on the frontiers of Hell, where they possess innate control over the hellfire that flickers along the infernal realm's brazen ramparts. Their mastery over these infernal flames often sees them recruited away from Avernus, drawn to some of the most dismal forges in the Pit, such as the fortress-cities of Dis and the Burning Legions of Phelgethon, where their titanic strength and rage is harnessed to power the foundries. Chortovs rarely work in groups, each arrogant but typically dull-witted brute harboring a vicious hatred for the grotesqueries, ineptitudes, and injustice tormenting others of their kind. Should they be forced into close proximity by the orders of their lords, such devils tolerate one another, but are quick to quarrel with their monstrous cousins. While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction typically overshadows benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such, chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends. Barbazus, erinyes, and-most commonly- imps typically serve as minders of their towering brethren, as even greater devils fear the might of those rare chortovs that manage to escape Hell's control.",6400
Chrestomath,6,outsider,any,"This bloated, larval sack of green and pink flesh is wet and curdled, its brainlike wrinkles interrupted by transparent membranes showing dark fluid within.","The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races. While the most common caulborn are the humanoid versions , there exists a second kind as well: the bloated and blind intelligences called chrestomaths, sometimes referred to as living libraries, or simply ""brain-sacks."" Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder-and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive's massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they've stolen from others. Indeed, it's possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race's mysterious origins. A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk. These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as mage hand to affect their surroundings. Ecology Every caulborn colony has at least one chrestomath, but these creatures are made, not born. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn select several of their own members via criteria unique to each colony. These chosen individuals are promptly disassembled and rendered down in a solemn ritual, their living organs melded together into a single blob of curdled flesh. The resulting protoplasmic sack has no outside sensory organs or useful manipulating appendages, only a massive intelligence whose psychic abilities increase even as the world around it loses relevance, the isolation honing its intellect. Once the brain sack is complete, the caulborn seed it with every fact and record at the colony's disposal, usually copying knowledge over from other chrestomaths. Though their psychic abilities give chrestomaths the ability to float sluggishly through the air, most caulborn consider this a waste of the organic thinking machines' time, and instead assign teams of humanoid caulborn to carry the living data centers around in palanquins or set them up in vast chapels. Chrestomaths are completely dependent on their kin for survival. Just as normal caulborn consume the psychic energy of other races through stolen ideas and concepts, chrestomaths are unable to feed directly from the source creatures, instead requiring their less intelligent brethren to regurgitate the predigested knowledge for them, sometimes also injecting them with additional nutrients and magical concoctions. While caulborn within range may access a chrestomath's memory, this information can be devastating to other creatures. In addition to its normal telepathy and mind-reading, a chrestomath confronted with dangerous creatures can establish a psychic link through which it pushes huge amounts of information. The recipients of this attack find their brains overloaded by the tidal wave of knowledge, rendering them catatonic or violently insane. Habitat & Society While most chrestomaths have very little personality, traces of identity being consumed by oceans of information, some eventually grow to control the data stored inside them and reestablish some semblance of self. One of the best such examples is Anamnesis, the One That Watches. As the heart of Xavorax, the city of caulborn and vampires deep below Kaer Maga, Anamnesis may well be one of the most learned entities on the face of Golarion, its thoughts and motives far beyond human comprehension. To outsiders, the thousands of pounds of flesh might seem barely sentient, capable only of shifting its colors to reflect emotions. Yet whether it's slave or master-or perhaps both-the lord of the Quivering Palace influences all the residents of Xavorax, watching over them as the central relay of their hive mind and the repository of all their race holds dear. While parasitic by nature, caulborn are not necessarily predatory, and aren't above trading for the sustenance they need. When they do so, it's often as prophets, a role in which chrestomaths are singularly important. Left with nothing but godlike memories and an ability to analyze information, chrestomaths are often able to extrapolate from trends and make logical connections that result in uncannily accurate predictions about future events.",2400
Chrystone,4,construct,any,"This creature appears as a statue constructed of rock and crystal. It has almost no neck; its head seems attached firmly to its shoulders, though by observing it, you see that it is able to turn its head freely. Each of its hands has two fingers and two opposable thumbs.","Chrystones are creatures made of rock and crystal that normally stand just over 5 feet tall. Their coloration varies by the types of crystal and rock they absorb, giving each chrystone a unique pattern of striations and coloration that makes them easy to tell apart. Originally imbued with life by a spellcaster in a ritual involving the blood of several dragons and a demon, chrystones grow new offspring through budding. To form a new bud, a chrystone must consume several times its weight in crystals and consume at least 300 gp worth of gems. The bud continues to grow from the chrystone's back until it is large enough to separate. Each chrystone offspring retains the memories and knowledge of its entire parental line. Chrystones were originally created to be part of an army, but those plans were cut short by their creator's death. As they developed and spread, they became more free-willed and independent and wished to make certain they were never enslaved again. They retain all of the abilities that would have made them a powerful army, and their racial knowledge helps them put these abilities to the best possible use. Chrystones, while usually neutral, have a racial memory of being slaves to the whim of their creator. This memory makes them somewhat paranoid when dealing with other races, making them more likely to attack other races than talk with them. Chrystones open with color spray which emanates from their mouth like a breath weapon and then close for melee combat if targets are close enough; otherwise, they stand back and fight with their longswords. If a battle is going poorly, a chrystone attempts to retreat and ambush its opponents when it has repaired itself. Construction A chrystone's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 1,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 1,000 gp.

Chupacabra,3,magical beast,warm hills or plains,"This lizard-like creature stalks forward upon two muscular legs, a mane of spikes running down its scaly back.","These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often watching potential prey from hiding for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they prefer to keep to areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly ref lective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings. With a preference for lone travelers and farm animals , chupacabras leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly blood-drained husks of their meals, often leading locals to believe a reckless vampire lives in the area. A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from muzzle to tail tip and stands just under 4 feet tall. Slightly built and light of bone, most weigh close to a hundred pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed. Although chupacabras are typically solitary, in bountiful areas small gangs of the beasts can form. These groups work well together, becoming bold enough to attack larger groups of animals and more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. It is not unusual for older chupacabras to grow to Medium size. These larger specimens tend to be leaders of chupacabra gangs, or, more commonly, loners capable of tormenting entire villages on their own. Some chupacabras are mutants with large reptilian wings, and have been known to carry off goats and children. A flying chupacabra has a fly speed of 60 feet , which increases to 90 feet  when invigorated from drinking blood. A winged chupacabra is the same CR as the normal variety.",800
Church Grim,5,magical beast,land,"This creature resembles a large, ghostly black dog with glowing red eyes.","Church grims are good spirits that guard cemeteries from those who seek to steal from the dead, or those who wish to desecrate the sanctity of the graves there. The eyes of a church grim see all evil that crosses into its territory, and it spares no mercy for such trespassers. The precinct of a church grim is the cemetery and church it has chosen to protect, and it cannot leave that holy ground around. A church grim cannot truly be destroyed, for it is not a mortal creature of flesh and blood. If dispatched, a church grim will return the following night to resume its duties. A church or temple dedicated to a good deity is 25% likely to have attracted a guardian church grim; this chance increases to 75% if the church or temple grounds have been hallowed. A church grim does not attack or harm anyone that enters the churchyard or the cemetery if they are there to worship or pay their respects. It only attacks evil creatures and those who enter the churchyard to rob from the dead. Church grims always attack undead creatures on sight. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",1600
Churr,5,monstrous humanoid,temperate forests,"The trees and underbrush in front of you explode forth sending a hail of leaves and brush in your direction. From the tangled mess emerged several feral, ape-like creatures with elongated nails and fangs.","Churrs are savage ape-like creatures found in heavily forestsed areas. They are fairly intelligent, standing 8 feet tall and have great reach. Some churrs are known to use primitive clubs or fashion spears with which to hunt. Churrs are omnivorous, eating fresh game as well as fruits and vegetable matter. In rare instances, stone-aged tribes have been known to adopt churr as guardians, teaching them sign language and a few words, which they can repeat with a guttural accent that takes some time and practice to understand. Churr may cross breed with most humanoid and ape species making them a ""missing link"" or bridge species. Their progeny are often somewhat smaller but more intelligent, having full linguistic capacity. Evil bands of churr are known to kidnap humanoids to use as slaves for collecting fruit and de-lousing purposes. Such slaves are kept until such time as they have enraged the churr and it decides to eat it. A churr stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Churrs speak a bastardized form of Giant. Churr begin combat by unleashing their horrific howl and beating their chests. They then charge opponents attempting to get their meaty paws around them and choke the life from them. Churr Society Churrs tend to congregate in small bands or packs of less than 20 individuals. Males dominate the pack and females are tasked with menial chores, childbearing, and the raising of the young. Usually the strongest and most powerful churr becomes the leader. Fights to the death are not uncommon when the current leader dies as the replacements vie for the open slot. Churr Characters Churr have racial Hit Dice and can have class level.

Chuul,7,aberration,temperate swamps,This lobster-like creature has a thick armored shell. A pair of tiny eyes gleams above a mouth full of writhing tentacles.,"Chuuls are armored, crustacean-like predators that lurk beneath the surfaces of shallow ponds and mires, bursting from concealment to snatch up prey in their chitinous pincers and then paralyzing them with their mouth tentacles before eating them alive. Chuuls are excellent swimmers but prefer to attack land-bound creatures or those wallowing in shallow waters. Once they seize their victims, chuuls often drag grappled foes back into deep waters to drown them. Lizardfolk are by far the chuul's favorite prey, though those pale chuul breeds that live underground prefer morlocks, duergar, unwary drow, and other unfortunates who get too close to their subterranean watersways-with the exception of troglodytes, whose flavor chuuls find particularly offensive. Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, leading mto speculate fruitlessly on their origins and motivations. They speak a chittering, burbling dialect of Common, but few are inclined to speak to those outside their race, and if chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season, humanoids have yet to record it. Instead, chuul intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect ambush sites to attack other intelligent creatures and decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their kills. Though the chuuls themselves seem uninterested in using tools of kind, they have an almost compulsive need to collect keepsakes from their victims.

Guards walk the streets regularly, policing the various quarters and maintaining peace throughout the city, though the wealthier districts see noticeably more protection than areas such as the Shadow.

Clamor,4,aberration,land,"A series of garbled voices, clicks, grinding noises, and other less discernible sounds seem to emanate from empty air, with no obvious point of origin.","Clamors have a playful kind of intelligence, and they appear to desire communication. Being able to mimic sound they have ever encountered, clamors wander the Material Plane emitting a nonsensical cacophony of voices, crashes, clicks, roars, and music. Since they are usually invisible, most adventurers that encounter a clamor walk away from the creature without ever having realized that they had met one. Ma sentry on duty has heard only his own voice in response to what he thought was someone walking around out in the darkness; what he really heard was a clamor trying to talk to him. Bards are fascinated by these odd creatures, and ma bard has gained a clamor as a companion of sorts. They have intelligence, and can be trained. A bard of at least 5th level that has had prior contact with a clamor is capable of communicating with these creatures on a rudimentary basis. The intelligence of a clamor is just barely above that of a small child, so complex communication is out of reach. Clamors tend to keep at a distance, emitting random noises and ""playing back"" interesting sound made by the creatures they are observing. Once provoked to attack, clamors strike at their foes with high frequency sonic beams. If cornered or overwhelmed, a clamor uses its sonic burst ability before attempting to flee using its speed of sound ability, which almost always ensures its escape.

Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template. Ecology Clawbats are scavengers and opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in the thick of battle. Clawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass, aggravating their victims' existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues. This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When the wounds of clawbats' prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore. Aiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature. Clawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures' eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring to creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watersed by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watersing of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim's first warning of impending danger. Other flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats' natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting. Habitat & Society Clawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures' awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and msquirming limbs- no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move quickly to exterminate clawbats that appear in their lands.",400

Clockwork Brain Gear,3,construct,any,This small copper box glows with a pale blue light.,"The original brain gear began as little more than a collection of gears, chains, counterweights, and levers, but was enhanced and grown into a controlling intellect through a process very similar to flesh golem creation. A brain gear in its true form resembles nothing more than a copper or gold box or cube that shines with a pale blue light. It is immobile, cannot attack, or speak. A brain gear is designed to control the actions of all other clockworks created by the caster, relieving the creator of having to oversee simple operations of the clockworks. A brain gear has no real attacks. It uses its clockworks to protect and defend it. Brain gears can be programmed to instruct clockworks to perform up to 20 specific tasks and can be programmed to instruct clockworks to react to certain situations that it perceives. It is rumored that some brain gears occasionally develop an evil intellect and turn their charges against its creator.",800
Clockwork Drone,0.17,construct,any,"This creature appears as a human eyeball encased within a flat, metal disk.","Imbued with magic that allows it to fly, a drone has an approach typically marked by the low buzz of its tiny gears and pistons, which work furiously to maintain the magical field that allows it to fly. These clockworks are designed to act as observers. When a drone finds an advantageous position from which to maintain its watch, it uses a small, metallic claw on its underside to attach itself to a surface. Drones usually avoid combat at all costs. When they are pressed into fighting, they prefer to aid their fellow clockworks by distracting their enemies.",65
Clockwork Familiar,2,construct,any,"This tiny metallic creature is shaped like a raven, yet beneath its shining, articulated plates whir gears and spinning belts.","When it comes to familiars, most arcanists satisfy themselves with mundane creatures such as rats and lizards. Those with the power to bind greater assistants often call forth helpers from the planes, turning minor fiends or celestials to their will. Yet for artificers and those who fuse magic with machinery, the best familiar is the one the caster creates herself, breathing life into a clockwork mechanism of her own design. Clockwork familiars can take a variety of forms depending on the whim of the creator. Most popular are tiny metal dragons, birds , faceless humanoids, and spiders that run on clicking, needlelike legs, though practically shape and material can be animated in this fashion. With its ability to generate electric shocks, a clockwork familiar can be useful in combat, yet it more often finds more use in the workshop, where its methodical thought processes and innate knowledge of mechanical systems allow it to offer valuable advice. In addition, each clockwork familiar has a unique relationship with a particular type of magic item, established at creation. When items of the chosen sort are slotted into the familiars-usually via a locking compartment, though some familiars simply drink potions, their metal stomachs becoming new receptacles- the familiars gain the ability to drain the magic back out of the items and turn it toward a different preset purpose, such as healing themselves or creating a specific spell effect. A typical clockwork familiar is roughly 2 feet tall or long and weighs 10 pounds. While the stat block here represents a raven familiar, and hence has a fly speed, other forms may trade this ability for a different form of movement, such as a clockwork piranha with a swim speed of 40 feet or a mechanical badger with a burrow speed of 10 feet. Ecology Clockwork familiars can be constructed from a wide variety of materials, the most common being adamantine, steel, and bronze. Though their bodies are often expertly crafted contraptions of gears, drive shafts, and even circuitry, a clockwork familiar is not simply a robotic wind-up toy, nor is its consciousness the result of elaborate programming. Instead, each construct is more like a vehicle for the tiny spirit that lives inside its heart. On their own, these flickers of consciousness-pulled from the fundamental animating energy of the planes-would have no real ability to affect their surroundings. Only through the specially attuned constructs created by arcanists do they gain the ability to truly live, and it's perhaps gratitude for this service that initially binds clockwork familiars to their creators. Once called into being and installed in its new vessel, a clockwork familiar's animating spirit controls its mechanical manipulators through tiny bursts of magical or electrical energy. As a result, most such constructs have conductive metal parts, and thus an instinctive fear of waters and corrosion. Unable to heal naturally, clockwork familiars know that if their systems fail, they may never again be granted the chance to interact with the world. As a result, most clockwork familiars tend to be slightly paranoid and demanding when it comes to getting their masters to keep them in good repair, and it's not uncommon to find a clockwork familiar left to its own devices busily scouring rust from its shell, performing maintenance on itself, or attempting to improve the resilience of its basic functions. Habitat & Society As created creatures, clockwork familiars have little society of their own, and tend to take on mannerisms and speech patterns similar to their masters'. Most feel an instinctive affection for their masters, though as intelligent beings it's not unheard of for the little automatons to have existential crises if their masters mistreat or ignore them. Clockwork familiars are often fascinated by other construct creatures and may attempt to befriend or study them, the better to understand how their systems work. Though they rarely adopt religion on their own, familiars with religious masters may go through the motions of worship as a way of honoring their place in the great chain of creation-left to themselves, clockwork familiars tend to be more interested in the systems and logic by which the natural world and planes operate than in particular entities, including deities. While clockwork familiars have little desire for treasure themselves, they understand its value in trading, and may snatch up worthwhile items either on behalf of their master or-if they're concerned about being provided for-as emergency funds with which to purchase information or repairs, or as fuel for their magic-draining abilities. Clockwork familiars value knowledge above all things, though they tend to focus on logic, mathematics, organizational systems, and new ways of seeing and interpreting the world rather than simple facts. In a clockwork familiar's eyes, an almanac is useless clutter, but a textbook on geometry or chemistry is worth more than a pile of gold. As intelligent creatures, clockwork familiars have an ambiguous relationship with the lives of servitude they're inevitably born into. For some, the philosophical quandaries are small and easily managed, as their creators treat them well, ask their opinion, share their stores of valuable knowledge, and may even come to love them. For others, whose masters see them as slaves at best and irritatingly imperfect projects at worst, only fear for their continued existence keeps the constructs in line. Mfall somewhere in the middle, and are interested in all the world has to offer even down to the mundanity of fetching and polishing, and thus are content to experience life on their masters' terms.

Clockwork Swarm,4,construct,any,A mass of tiny insect-like mechanical creatures surges closer.,"Clockwork swarms are a collection of tiny, insect-like clockworks that work together as a single creature.

The swarm, however, is much more capable of adapting to new situations and surviving combat. Unless the individual components of the swarm are destroyed, it simply reforms and continues its attack. Area of effect attacks, such as burning oil, fireball, or lightning bolt are the most effective means of destroying the swarm. A clockwork swarm typically appears as a ramshackle collection of spare parts and garbage draped in a thick, web-like substance and arranged in a vaguely humanoid form. A swarm prefers to lie in wait and strike from ambush, collecting innocuous looking piles of debris that adventurers overlook as harmless but that the swarm is capable of quickly forming into a combat-worthy frame.

Cockatrice,3,magical beast,temperate plains,"This hideous avian creature has the body of an emaciated rooster, the wings of a bat, and a long, scaly tail.","Stupid, vicious, and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures due to their magical ability to turn flesh to stone. Legends say that the first cockatrice emerged from an egg laid by a cockerel and incubated by a toad. Whether or not the story is true, today's cockatrices breed true in terrifying and filthy dens haphazardly excavated by as mas a dozen of the squawking creatures.

While their diet consists primarily of seeds and petrified insects , cockatrices fiercely defend their territories from anything they deem a threat, and the wanderings of rogue males seeking new spots to build dens sometimes bring them into unintentional contact with humanoids, with devastating results. The cockatrice's strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is the creature's greatest defense, and a cockatrice lair is invariably littered with petrified remnants of foes. In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets- the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices' nests and consume their eggs-appear to be completely immune to the effect.

In combat, a coffer corpse attacks with a slam attack. It attempts to grab an opponent around the throat, and if successful, the creature does not let go until either it is destroyed or the opponent is dead. Small percentages  of coffer corpses carry weapons  and use those in combat instead of their slam attack.

Colour Out of Space,10,ooze,any,"An eerie radiance, a glow unlike anything else, suddenly suffuses the area, bringing with it a stif ling sense of latent malignancy.","The deepest, strangest parts of the Dark Tapestry hold truly alien concepts, and of those, few are more notorious than the colour out of space. The lack of a physical body does little to impede this deadly alien lifeform's ability to cause incredible devastation. The fact that its life cycle requires periodic visits from the deepest reaches of space to gestate and grow in the vicinity of powerful gravitational fields such as those created by planets only increases the monster's opportunities to bring ruin to countless worlds. The colour out of space is just that-a mobile radiance. Its glow is unlike seen in nature, and while those few who encounter one of these creatures and survive to tell the tale may describe the radiance or depict it in art as a sinister green-gray illumination, these depictions are flawed reproductions. To witness the colour out of space is to know there are things no humanoid mind can fully comprehend, describe, or explain. Ecology Very little is known about the life cycle of a colour that dwells in the depths of space, for it is only when they come to a planet to grow and reproduce that other lifeforms encounter them. A colour's arrival upon a world is typically via a small meteorite strike-the colour itself infuses this meteorite, and shortly after the falling star's arrival, the rock crumbles away to expose the semisolid mass of a larval colour that seeps into the surrounding landscape. Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-f loating eerie radiance. Natural sunlight doesn't particularly harm colours out of space, but they prefer to dwell in darkened areas like deep caves or abandoned wells where their own radiance has little or no competition. Over the course of several weeks, months, or even years, the colour feeds upon the surrounding plant and animal life-the act of this feeding is weirdly addictive to its victims, who over time develop a self-destructive lassitude that prevents flight from the region. When a colour has absorbed enough life to grow to full maturity , it gathers its strength and erupts from its den, coruscating into the skies as it launches the majority of itself back into space to continue its unknowable existence in the Dark Tapestry. Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again. Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but by the presence of those the colour has fed from. These unfortunate deformed individuals, known as colour-blighted creatures, never live for long, but while they do, their madness often drives them to unusually violent behavior, be they men or beasts. Colour-Blighted Simple Template  A creature with the colour-blighted simple template appears hideously deformed and glows with the same unnamable color as the creature that blighted it. A colour-blighted creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. Rebuild Rules: A colour-blighted creature's ability scores suffer drain as a result of being fed upon by a colour out of space, but once a creature gains this template, it becomes immune to further feed attacks from colours out of space until it loses the colour-blighted simple template. A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; other ability scores are not altered. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one need only restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes strangely aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must make a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist crumbling into fine white ash-such a doom means instant death and, for mcolor-blighted creatures, their only chance at escape from a life filled with pain.",9600
Coloxus,12,outsider,urban,This figure would be the picture of elegance and refinement were it not for its grotesque fly head and shivering insectile wings.,"Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ironically-given their grotesque, insectile appearance-coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption. Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand. Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a ref lection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors-creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.",19200
Common Eurypterid,1,vermin,temperate or warm oceans,"Two large pincers grasp at the air before this sleek creature, while a finned tail bristling with a long, thin stinger rises from behind.","Known to some as sea scorpions, eurypterids are waters crustaceans that blur the line between their terrestrial cousins and lobsters. Primeval and voracious, these vermin range in size from relatively harmless ochre eurypterids the size of a dog up to the truly immense spitting eurypterids. There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whaleeating eurypterids by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common-an aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of waters indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",400

Common Time Elemental,8,outsider,Plane of Time,This creature appears as a formless cloud of yellowish-red vapor or dust about 5 feet in diameter.,"Time elementals are creatures from a plane most sages are unaware even exists. A time elemental is a powerful creature formed of pure time and matter such as is unknown to even the most learned of sages. It is unknown how or why time elementals enter the Material Plane, as they cannot be summoned using the standard summoning spells. Time elementals attack by forming misty or smoky arms from their forms and lashing at opponents or by spraying a fine mist onto their opponents so as to induce aging. Against particularly powerful opponents, a time elemental uses its alter age ability or  summons additional time elementals to its aid.

Comozant Wyrd,4,outsider,oceans,No text supplied,"A comozant wyrd appears to be approximately 3 feet of heatless blue or violet plasma jutting from solid, protruding objects . It flickers like flame, and its only static features resemble those of a humanoid face. Manifested on the Material Plane, the creature emits an uncanny buzzing, hissing noise, but does not consume creatures or objects it touches. Creatures adjacent to it or to targets of its illuminating flames often find their hair literally standing on end and their bodies crawling with harmless but unnerving sparks. Ecology Comozant wyrds are most often encountered in the hearts of Golarion's greatest storms, particularly the Eye of Abendego and the smaller storms it spawns. They are incredibly rare, and almost always solitary; no sightings on land have ever been reported. Because they are so rare and their natural environment makes detached study improbable, few creatures on Golarion even know of comozant wyrds, let alone understand their nature. Citing their command of storms, some speculate that the wyrds are infant forms of an unknown breed of storm elementals, but others say they are fey spirits, born in the moment they appear and existing only for the brief time they shine. Habitat & Society Comozant wyrds have no society as such. Seafarers regard them with considerable awe for the danger and mystery that attend them, but few are brave enough to attempt conversation with living plasma on a wooden ship, especially mid-tempest. Displaying such mettle is a sure way to earn considerable respect from ordinary sailor-persuading a wyrd to abate its storm could inspire outright awe. Comozant wyrds rarely speak even to those fluent in Auran, preferring to communicate in a more primal way, using their illuminating flames. Those who have ""conversed"" with a wyrd in this way describe an alien mode of communication that is as much raw emotion and image as it is concept and word, and a mysterious mixture of knowledge and ignorance. For instance, when first encountered, a wyrd apparently does not understand how different from itself mortals are, or how dangerous storms are to mortal creatures. Overlying everything is an unsettlingly alien but somehow childlike inquisitiveness, mixed with rage or fear if the wyrd feels threatened. The form this interest takes can vary widely. One report describes spending half an hour in communion with a wyrd, exchanging detailed mental images of elemental and humanoid creatures' anatomies and behaviors while the storm raged unheeded around them. Another speaks of a wyrd chasing the entire crew of a pirate schooner around the deck of the ship with electrical attacks, punishing those who slowed, and stopping only when half the crew was dead. A third author writes of being flooded with comprehension of the nature of the cosmos in a single ecstatic instant, only for the wyrd to banish its own storm and disappear. Such vanishing is a reasonably common occurrence in non-hostile encounters with comozant wyrds. Several accounts agree that once wyrds understand the peril in which storms place mortals, they use their command of the weather to end the storm, even though this apparently forces them to either leave or vanish altogether. To some, this suggests that comozant wyrds possess at least some respect for life, and that what seems like cruelty may simply be uncomprehending curiosity, even playfulness. Naturally, those who have suffered at a wyrd's whim are unsympathetic to this view. One of the few things almost all accounts agree on is that the touch of a comozant wyrd's illuminating flames seems to confer sudden insight. Judging by images glimpsed in wyrds' minds, they appear to know, but not always understand, things that they glimpse in the thoughts, pasts, and entanglements of those with whom they converse. On one occasion, this has led to a traveler learning that one of her companions was in the pay of a hated rival. Other authors recount glimpses of scenes relevant to them that were happening at that precise moment halfway around the world, scenes of which nobody on board could possibly be aware. One way or another, very few of the available reports fail to mention the author glimpsing a secret she could not otherwise learn, an answer-or at least a hint- to a puzzle she had been attempting to solve, or a flash of inspiration that enabled her to complete some great work. These tales lead some desperate souls to seek out storms to sail into, hoping for answers they can find nowhere else. Comozant wyrds themselves do not seem to have a discernible agenda from moment to moment, or indeed to place very much weight on past experience. They will attack-or, conversely, stop fighting and ""parley""- without hesitation, based purely on whether they feel their immediate situation warrants it. This is not to say that they forget past behavior, but they seem to bear few grudges. They react badly when they detect deception, however, seemingly regarding it as only a short step down from outright violence.",1200

Contemplative Of Ashok,2,monstrous humanoid,urban,"This floating creature is mostly pulsating brain-sac, with the body beneath it somewhere between that of an insect and a human fetus.","Once, the entities that would become known as Contemplatives were relatively normal humanoids, notable only for their extreme intelligence. At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as telekinesis. Evolution-whether natural or forced by the Contemplatives themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the Contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank. Today, a Contemplative's massive brain makes up roughly 80 percent of its bodyweight. Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities, resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in appearance and demeanor, Contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conf lict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the Contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution. A typical Contemplative of Ashok weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 3 feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever it's talking to. Most become sages or arcanists, taking levels of wizard, sorcerer, bard, or other arcane spell-wielding classes; though divine casters are not unknown, most Contemplatives have little interest in the gods . When they speak inside another creature's head, their voices are monotone and seeming to come from everywhere at once, and when multiple Contemplatives are encountered, they almost always speak as ""we"" rather than the individual ""I.""",600
Contract Devil,10,outsider,any,"With rust-colored skin and a jutting crown of ridge-like horns, this muscular devil is draped in lengthy contracts.","A contract devil, also a called phistophilus, always appears handsome and confident, its chiseled features housing a perpetually smug grin. Contract devils have red skin and black hair and stand near 6-1/2 feet in height, not counting their horns. The thicket of horns around a contract devil's body increases its height to 7 feet and its weight to 350 pounds. Contract devils serve Asmodeus, archfiends, and the vast bureaucracy of Hell as clerks, scribes, and bargainers for mortal souls. They exist to keep track of the damned, to manage Hell's endless ordinances, and, when time and opportunity permit, to coax mortals into damnation. Most phistophiluses spend their eternities in the various courts of Hell's nine layers, particularly in the maze-like fortress-libraries where all infernal laws and oaths are recorded. Occasionally they serve similar roles on the Material Plane when summoned by particularly desperate, arrogant, or foolish mortals. When one of the souls damned by a contract devil is restored to life , the phistophilus immediately notices the transgression. Usually, the contract devil recruits the aid of more powerful allies to track down and punish such transgressors and to collect the escaped soul as quickly as possible. INFERNAL CONTRACTS While numerous types of infernal contracts exist, the following two are those most often offered to mortals by contract devils. Evil Wishes: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted three wishes, as per the spell. It must use these wishes within 24 hours of signing the contract-if it does not, the wishes are wasted but it remains bound to the contract nevertheless. While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase a wish. Infernal Slave: A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. The mortal chooses type of devil  of a CR equal to or less than its own character level at the time of the bargain. Upon signing the contract, the mortal's infernal slave appears and is bound to do the mortal no harm and follow its orders for as long as it lives. Although the devil must obey its master's commands, mdevils delight in corrupting the intentions of these orders in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways. BREAKING AN INFERNAL CONTRACT An agreement with a contract devil can only be broken in two ways. When a contract is signed, a second copy manifests; one copy is retained by the devil and the other is given to the mortal. Mortals are free to do whatever they please with the lengthy, obviously evil documents, while contract devils typically keep active contracts with them at all times. Should both copies of a contract be destroyed, effects caused by the contract are canceled or reversed and the mortal's soul goes to its normal place of rest after death and can be resurrected as normal. Merely absconding with both copies of the contract is not enough to break the contract-as long as both copies exist, the signer's soul remains forever damned. Alternatively, a second mortal might be allowed to adopt the terms of a contract-with its soul replacing that of the original contract signer after death. The mortal who seeks to pay the debt of another must contact the contract devil who holds the relevant contract. The contract devil has a choice of whether or not to allow one mortal to pay another's debt, but values religious and good-aligned souls over others. Shrewd manipulators, contract devils often only agree to allow one mortal to pay another's debt in return for some service or proof of worth. If a contract devil agrees to accept another soul in payment, the original contract signer retains all of the benefits of the contract, but is released from damnation and may be resurrected as normal. The new signer, however, receives no benefits, cannot be returned to life upon dying, and spends an eternity in Hell after death.",9600

Coral Capuchin,1,magical beast,warm coastlines or oceans,"This strange creature can only be described as a light pink, hairless monkey with the head of a fish and large, finlike wings.","Coral capuchins, when encountered outside of the waters, look like a wizard's practical joke-they have the body of a small monkey, slick pink skin, a fishlike head, and membranous appendages that are a cross between a bat's wings and a fish's fins. They possess a monkey's innate intelligence and curiosity, displaying little fear of humanoids, but are also compulsive pickpockets that love the glimmer of gold and jewels, and posses the manual dexterity to relieve unsuspecting sailors and dockworkers of their hard-earned pay. An adult coral capuchin is a foot and a half in length, with a foot-long tail, a 4-foot wingspan, and a weight of 25 pounds. Ecology Sages believe coral capuchins evolved from highly adaptive creatures living in the world's oceans. It is believed these creatures first developed as wholly waters creatures much like fish, and lived among brightly colored coral reefs where they used a form of camouf lage to hide and escape predation, much like a cuttlefish or octopus. The creatures developed multiple methods of locomotion through evolution, and these biological changes allowed these creatures to crawl from the sea and walk on land. Eventually their fins transformed into wings, granting the creature greater mobility, and the ability not only to breathe the air above the waves, but also to soar through it. Coral capuchins are capable of surviving out of the waters in their air-breathing form for part of the day, although they quickly deteriorate and die if they do not keep their bodies moist. They spend most of their lives below the waves, subsisting on small fish and all manner of vegetation, but often venture onto land to find a particularly tasty morsel, or to satisfy their overactive natural curiosity. They also love to fly and can often be seen circling the crow's nests of ships entering and leaving harbor. On land, they hunt small rodents, pick nuts and berries, and find the eggs of birds a particular delicacy. Coral capuchins also display an intense interest in the food and belongings of all manner of humanoid species. They are especially drawn to small, shiny objects, and can be counted on to abscond with anything interesting that is not nailed down. Coral capuchins' hands allow them to manipulate objects, but they cannot wield weapons. A coral capuchin is born as a wholly waters creature. Young coral capuchins lack the ability to fly or leave the waters until they reach adulthood after approximately their first year of life. They are an incredibly fecund race, and females can produce a clutch of up to 100 eggs three times a year, though local waters predators usually devour most of these. Because of their dependence on returning to the waters, some coral capuchins venturing too far inland risk stranding themselves. Explorers find the creatures sickly and weak, sprawled out on the junglesfloor covered in biting ants or picked apart by predators as they lie there dying. Coral capuchins that die on land dry, out to a husk that often turns to dust leaving only its brittle bones behind. Habitat & Society Living in greater numbers along the southeastern coast of Garund, these creatures have slowly spread out, making their way north and east over the last few centuries. A large colony of the creatures resides off the coast south of Sargava and within the Lower Korir rivers Delta. The canopies of the junglesof Hungry Trees and the jungles of the Kaava Lands ring with the calls of coral capuchins. An infestation of the clever creatures has recently plagued the port city of Senghor on the Fever Sea, and a city authority has begun offering a bounty on the creatures in an attempt to reduce their numbers. A few colonies of the creatures exist farther north, with some making their homes in the warmer waters of the Inner Sea, while other curious tribes of these mischievous creatures inhabit the warm waters of the Obari oceans on Garund's western coast. Coral capuchins live in tropical coastlines areas, generally in small familial groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older female. The first part of their name refers not only to their pinkish skin color, but also to their preferred nesting place-the coral reefs off of Garund's coast, where they make their homes in the countless caves and crevices found therein. They populate these vivid reefs to lay their eggs and hide among the protective growth, adapting their skin pigmentation to blend in. Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often domesticated by sailors and fisherman willing to put up with the creatures' incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They are often trained to fish for their masters, and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the oceans floor. Because of their love for shiny objects, they make excellent pearl divers, although it can sometimes be a struggle to get them to part with their treasures. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long oceans voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, msailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other such seafaring folk, who more willingly accept their thieving nature. Coral Capuchins as Familiars Despite their mercurial temperaments and propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the creatures' exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. This bite allows spellcasters greater ability to explore below the waves, as long as they pay close attention to their time outside of the waters. Despite this benef it, coral capuchins are more popular among spellcasters who don't mind running afoul of the law, as the small creatures' thieving behavior is diff icult to fully control and often gets their masters into trouble. In addition, coral capuchins' need to stay moistened means they are better suited to serve as familiars for those living near waters or willing to make compensations for this unusual physiology. Spellcasters of 3rd level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.",400

Corpse Candle,5,undead,waters,"A pale man with hollow eyes looks up impassively from beneath the rippling surface of the dark waters, a dim glow gives his form a ghostly translucence.","Corpse candles are formed when creatures are sacrificed by ritualistic drowning to a sea or waters deity. The fear of dying coupled with the hatred of the ones performing the ritual infuses the victims' spirit with energy that often lingers in the area and empowers the corpse with unlife, raising it as a corpse candle. Corpse candles hate the living, and have a particular dislike for clerics. Corpse candles are bound to the area of their death in the sense that they cannot leave that particular body of waters . A corpse candle appears as a translucent image of its living self. Its body shows little, if any, signs of death, though as its ""ages"", the corpse candle's translucence seems to grow faint and fade . Some sages have researched this phenomenon and believe that corpse candles can actually die of old age. Perhaps some remnant of their former lives binds them to the mortal world or perhaps sages are just reaching for answers to some unknown equation. Corpse candles detest the living and seek to lure wayfarers to their doom using trickery and misdirection. Corpse candles use their ability of deception to lure unsuspecting victims to their doom. When a corpse candle successfully fascinates a creature, it waits until the creature draws near and then attacks relentlessly with its incorporeal claws. Corpse candles are particularly fond of luring sailors, swimmers, and other seafarers to their watersy graves by first fascinating them, draining sapping them of their strength, and finally allowing them to drown as the lights sap their vitality. Drowned victims are left as food for waters carnivores in the area. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Corpse Orgy,13,aberration,underground,"Screaming and wriggling, this foul being appears to be a pile of entwined moldering corpses.","A corpse orgy is truly a disgusting creature easily mistaken for a pile of rotten corpses. In truth, the creature is a conglomeration of creatures it has killed and absorbed into its body. As parts of the corpse orgy rot away, it replaces them with freshly slain prey. A corpse orgy makes its home in deep subterranean caverns and dungeons. Here it can usually find sanctuary amongst the bone pits and corpse piles of other underground denizens where it bides its time, casually adding fresh ""meat"" to its obscene framework. In times when food is scarce , the creature may journey to the surface world to hunt for food. A corpse orgy is not picky when it comes to its diet.

Corpse Rook,5,magical beast,temperate or warm plains,"This creature resembles a three-headed raven with oily black feathers and bright silver talons and beak. A pungent, almost sulfuric odor emanates from the creature. Its wings are tipped with silver feathers.","Corpse rooks are giant three-headed birds of prey that devour just about anything they can catch, preferring a diet of horses, giant lizards, dire rats, giant frogs, cattle, sheep, and humanoids. They build their nests at the top of broadleaved trees or high atop rocky outcroppings in less forestsed terrain. A corpse rook's nest is constructed from mud, grass, hair, leaves, and the bones of their victims. These creatures do not associate with other avian creatures and are often hunted by red dragons, green dragons, rocs, and wyverns . Corpse rooks are solitary hunters with a hunting territory often covering 5 miles in each direction away from its nest. Hunting is always done during the day when the corpse rook has the advantage. During mating season  both the male and female corpse rook hunt for food, sometimes together, but most often in separate directions away from the nest. A nest typically contains 1d4 silver and gold-flecked eggs as well as treasure from slain prey. Corpse rooks attack their foes from the air, slashing with their claws and biting with their sharpened beaks. They rarely land on the ground during battle, preferring to swoop in and out of melee to keep their opponents off balance. Multiple corpse rooks work together to bring down prey; one might land on the ground to draw the attention of the prey, while the other corpse rook swoops in behind to flank.

Bands of gray and silver ring its abdomen and legs, and its body is covered in short, bristly hairs of white and silver. A large skull-like marking appears on the creature's thorax. Its eight eyes are stark white.","Corpsespinners are highly aggressive extraplanar spiders originating on the Astral Plane. Only rarely do they enter the Material Plane in search of prey, choosing to hunt on the Astral Plane searching and devouring astral sharks and other native creatures. On the Material Plane, they often hunt other giant spiders or humanoids. On the Astral Plane, corpsespinners spend their time constructing elaborate webs. The webs use mdifferent things as anchor points such as rare natural occurring materials on the Astral Plane, corpses of deceased astral travelers, and just about anything else the corpsespinner can incorporate into its webbing. When not constructing its webs, the corpsespinner is usually hunting. And this sometimes leads it to the Material Plane. If encountered on the Material Plane, there is a good chance the corpsespinner has a group of corpsespun with it, the victim's of its most recent kills. Corpsespinners are primarily solitary creatures in regards to associating with others of their kind. Their Ecology and reproduction cycles are unknown at this point, though intrepid interplanar adventurers have talked of huge webbed lairs on the Astral Plane containing young corpsespinners. Corpsespinners hunt their prey on the Astral Plane, only occasionally entering the Material Plane to look for food. Once prey is sighted, the corpsespinner moves quickly to encase it in its sticky webbing before attacking repeatedly with its poisonous bite. On the Material Plane it attacks a foe, shifts to the Astral Plane, and shifts back again to finish the opponent off. If forced to retreat, the corpsespinner shifts to the Astral Plane and returns to its lair. A corpsespinner usually has a gang of corpsespun with it . In such a case, the corpsespinner attempts to web its foes and let the corpsespun move in to soften them up. The corpsespinner then charges in and bites its targets to finish them off.

Couatl,10,outsider,warm forests,This great serpent has multicolored wings and eyes that glimmer with intense awareness.,"Couatls are servants of lawful and good deities, though some operate independently of greater being. Respected and admired for their wisdom and beauty, they try to steer mortals onto the right path and use their powers to fight evil, particularly those known to shift between the planes. Some couatls are viewed as benevolent gods by isolated societies, and while most couatls cringe at the thought of pretending to be a god, they allow such misconceptions to continue since they allow the couatls to guide and coax these societies onto paths of peace and cooperation with their neighbors. A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It weighs 1,800 pounds. As native outsiders, couatls must eat. They prefer the same foods as true snakes, such as mammals and birds, though they have been known to eat evil humanoids.",6400
Crab Swarm,4,vermin,waters,"A writhing mass of clacking shells and snapping pincers rushes from the surf, their spider-like legs twitching across the sand.","Crab swarms contain over a thousand normal-sized crabs that rush over their victims, plucking flesh with thousands of pinching claws. Some fishermen claim tides and phases of the moon cause these creatures to swarm as they do.",1200
Crabman,2,monstrous humanoid,Temperate waters,"This giant-sized creature is a bipedal humanoid with a crab-like head, large hands that end in powerful pincers, feet that are splayed. It is covered with chitinous plates, reddish-brown in color. Two smaller humanoid arms protrude below its pincers.","Crabmen inhabit coastlines waters, hunting fish and gathering food. Crabmen communicate with others of their race through a series of hisses and clicks. A typical crabman stands about 9 feet tall. They speak their own language, and those with an Intelligence of 12 or higher often speak common. Crabman Society Crabmen make their homes in sea caves and coastlines cliffs, venturing forth occasionally in search of food. They spend most of their time hunting, filtering algae for food, or scavenging the shores and beaches. Occasionally, they will gather wet sand from the seashore and filter it through their mouths, sucking out all organic material and plankton. The remainder is a hardened, dry ball of sand approximately 1 inch across; these pellets inadvertently give away the presence of a crabman community. Crabmen live in coastlines caves, but some communities will excavate more expansive burrows into the cliff face. Within such a warren, each individual has a lair set off from a centralized meeting area. Each crabman tribe is lead by an elder that can be of either sex. Most crabman tribal elders are at least 3rd-level warriors. Crabmen have no regular breeding or mating cycle, and each female seems to have her own periods of fertility and infertility. A fertile female will produce about 100 eggs within a two-week period. Crabman eggs are released into the oceans, hatching into translucent larvae with soft shells. These larvae vaguely resemble the adults, but may be mistaken for normal crabs given their size. After 6 months, crabman larvae molt and develop the harder shell required for life on land. Before their first molting, crabman larvae are practically defenseless. Crabmen rarely engage in commerce with other humanoid communities around them, including other crabman tribes. Crabman artisans produce only ephemeral goods made of driftwood, shells, and seaweed, and are quite capable of producing what other more aesthetic races would call works of art. Crabman Characters Crabmen have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Crabman characters possess the following traits. +6 Strength, +4 Constitution, -2 Charisma.

Crag Linnorm,14,dragon,cold hills,"This immense, wingless dragon rears up on a serpentine body. Its triple tail and powerful talons swipe at the air.","Like all linnorms, the deadly crag linnorm is a powerful, primeval dragon, a denizen of the wild regions far north of where most civilizations dare to tread. The crag linnorm is among the weakest of its kind, yet still a devastating predator in its own right. Favored, if not by the gods, then by some primal intelligence of the mysterious world of the fey, the linnorm bestows a powerful curse on who manage to slay it.

Crag Man,5,aberration,underground,"This creature resembles a thick, squat humanoid carved from stone. Small depressions in its head seem to function as eyes, and its mouth is a small, toothless crevice. Its arms end in powerful fists.","Sometimes called living stalagmites, crag men are found underground in naturally occurring caverns, caves, and other such subterranean places. They detest sunlight, but are not harmed by it. They are a malevolent race of semi-intelligent beings that make their way in the world by means of brutality, trickery, and deceit. Crag men prefer to attack from ambush. They wait, in stalagmite form for interlopers to enter their lair. Using their tremorsense ability, crag men can pinpoint the location of all intruders and wait patiently until they can catch their opponents unaware. At that time, they assume humanoid form and attack, pummeling their foes with their powerful fists or changing their fists into sharpened, dagger-like points and stabbing their opponents. If overpowered or outnumbered, a crag man summons a cluster of piercers to aid it or cover its escape. Creatures killed by crag men are stored as food and eventually devoured. Crag men communicate with one another through body language and a series of low, rumbling moans. Sages are unsure of whether crag men can actually speak or understand other language. Crag Man Society Crag Men have no formal society structure and exist in loose bands or colonies. The leader is the strongest member of the colony and rules through intimidation and fear. Crag men are believed to be asexual and sages have been unsuccessful in determining their exact means of reproduction. No young have ever been encountered, but several ""eggs"" resembling softened stone have been seen, closely guarded, in mcrag men lairs. Sages believe these ""eggs"" might shed some light on the crag men's means of reproducing-if they could only obtain one of the eggs to examine. Crag Men detest vilstraks  and attack them on sight, showing no mercy in battle until all vilstraks are dead or captured. The reason for this deep-seated hatred is unknown, but it believed to stem from a war long ago pitting a large colony of crag men against an even larger colony of vilstraks. Vilstraks are sometimes captured and kept as slaves. Those unfortunate enough to suffer this fate are ultimately killed when their usefulness expires. Crag Men have a strong affinity to piercers . These subterranean horrors are almost always found scattered throughout crag man lairs. The crag men are intelligent enough to know exactly where their piercer allies are located; piercers, in turn, will not drop down upon a crag man except in self-defense.

Crawling Hand,0.5,undead,land,"With a jolt, this severed hand springs to life, its fingers propelling it forth at great speed like a deformed spider.","Some say the origins of the crawling hand lie in the experiments of demented necromancers contracted to construct tiny assassins. Other tales tell of gruesome prosthetics sparked to life by evil magic, which then developed primitive sentience and vengefully strangled their hosts. Regardless, the crawling hand is an efficient killing tool. When not commanded to kill, the crawling hand remains still and can be handled and transported safely. Typically, owners carry them about in small, velvet-lined boxes. Crawling hands can also be placed as guardians and programmed with contingency commands, such as to hunt down and slay an individual who performs a specific task like violating a shrine, opening a warded door, or breaking the seal of a casket.",200
Crimson Basilisk,6,magical beast,underground,"This creature looks like a stocky, 8-legged, crimson scaled reptile. A row of bony spines juts from its back and runs the length of its body. Its eyes have a ghostly blue glow.","Crimson basilisks are variants of the common basilisk, and in some cases more dangerous. Adventurers can be relieved that they will not be turned to stone, but such relief is usually short-lived as they soon realize their equipment begins to disintegrate under acidic bites and they begin bleeding uncontrollably when they meet the creature's gaze. Crimson basilisks are subterranean carnivores with a voracious appetite that is only whetted when they get the thing they desire most-blood. While they can survive on a diet of plants, mosses, and meat, they prefer blood above all else, even attacking their own kind when food is scarce. A typical crimson basilisk lair is a stony cavern that reeks of blood and whose walls and ground are typically covered and caked in dried blood. The lair usually contains up to 5 of these creatures with an equal chance of males and females. From 1d4 young are likely to be present as well. Young do not fight or enter combat. A crimson basilisk is about 6 feet long and weighs over 400 pounds. Its skin is dull crimson though it can easily change its color  to match that of its surroundings. Its eight legs are thick and stout and end in sharpened claws. The spines on its back are crimson as well, though they tend to be darker than its overall body . Its eyes glow with a ghostly blue light. A crimson basilisk most often attacks from ambush, using its ability to camouflage itself against its surroundings and lying in wait for prey to wander too close. Once prey moves within 30 feet, it attacks, first using its gaze to bleed a foe and then quickly moving in to bite. If it successfully bleeds an opponent, the basilisk enters a frenzied state and attacks until either it or its prey is dead. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400

Criosphinx,7,magical beast,warm deserts or hills,"This creature has the wings of a bird, the body of a lion, and the head of a ram with sad, wise eyes.","Perhaps the least leonine of all sphinxes, the ram-headed criosphinx lacks the intellect of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, but still outmatches the dim-witted hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and androsphinxes, criosphinxes are always male. At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers its horns and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged. It favors charging down on foes from great heights. Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things, habitually extorting tolls for safe passage from who pass their lands. Groups who cannot pay must yield one of their number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal- single travelers must fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes, no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of metal or the gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep of sphinxes, though they sometimes lower themselves to a brief assignation in the rare event a criosphinx manages to impress them with wealth or wit. Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the deserts, trading upon the storied wisdom of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible travelers. Like their more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from passersby, but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than in exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as they possess usually comes from idle conversation with the creatures of the deserts, with criosphinxes using their inborn ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx lacking in sound information usually fabricates a pleasing lie. Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding them as little more than beasts and a disgrace to their noble race. They drive off their falcon-headed cousins with mock-charges and posturing, escalating to full-f ledged attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes they view with mixed fear and respect, and gynosphinxes with disdain and lust.",3200
Crocodile,2,animal,warm rivers or marshes,"This reptile lunges out of the placid waters with shocking speed.

Crucifixion Spirit,11,undead,any,This entity appears as a gaunt and translucent humanoid with puncture injuries to both wrists and both feet. Its face is twisted in eternal pain and its eyes flicker with a reddish glow.,"Crucifixion spirits are the ghostly remains of living beings executed through crucifixion. Their soul having not entirely departed the Material Plane, has risen to seek vengeance on the living, particularly clerics or other divine spellcasters whom they blame for forsaking them and allowing them to die in such a ghastly manner. Crucifixion spirits are most often encountered within 1,000 feet of the place of their execution, though some are found haunting burial grounds . Their only purpose seems to be to torment and kill that cross their path. They hold no memories of their former life, save the pain and suffering they endured at their time of execution, and they want all those they encounter to share in this pain. A crucifixion spirit engages living creature that enters its territory. It has no qualms about attacking creatures much larger or stronger than it. In combat, the crucifixion spirit's hatred for clerics and divine spellcasters becomes apparent as they are usually the first ones to feel the effects of its crucify soul ability. A crucified soul is left to die and the crucifixion spirit turns its attention to another opponent. A crucifixion spirit attacks until it is destroyed or its foes are slain or driven off.

Crypt Thing,5,undead,underground,"A skeletal humanoid wearing a dark hooded robe sits in a high-backed chair before you. Its eyes appear as small pinpoints of reddish light. As you approach it, the creature raises a bony hand and points at you.","Crypt things are undead creatures found guarding tombs, graves, crypts, and other such structures. They are created by spellcasters to guard such areas and they never leave their assigned area. A crypt thing never initiates combat. It is content to sit  in its assigned area so long as intruders do not disturb it or anything in the assigned area. At the first sign of disturbance however, a crypt thing springs to life. Its first order of business is to attempt to remove the interlopers from its assigned area by using its teleport other attack. Opponents that successfully resist are attacked by the crypt thing that uses its claws to rake and slash its foes. A crypt thing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Crypt Guardian There exists in some parts of the world  a variant of the crypt thing known as a crypt guardian. This variant has all the same abilities and powers as a normal crypt thing, with the following changes. The variant does not possess the teleport other ability. Instead, it possesses an ability known as cloak other. Cloak Other  Once per day as a standard action, a crypt guardian can simultaneously paralyze and turn invisible all creatures within 50 feet. An affected creature can make a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects . The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and invisible for 2d4 days.

Crysmal,3,outsider,underground,An animated cluster of translucent crystals shaped disturbingly like a gemstone scorpion scuttles into an aggressive stance.,"Scorpion-like crysmals originate in the deepest caverns of the Plane of Earth. On rare occasions, these strange creatures wind up on the Material Plane, usually in subterranean areas rich with natural gem and crystal formations. The crystalline planes of their bodies absorb and refract natural light, which some claim is the source of their supernatural powers. It does so by gathering stone crystals and gemstones, fashioning them into a Tiny facsimile of its own body, and jolting the new creature to life with a burst of the crysmal's own life energy. These newly created crysmals are known as shardlings , and grow to adulthood after a few months of gorging on crystals and gemstones. To make a single shardling, a crysmal requires 1,000 gp worth of crystals. Until it has enough material to reproduce, it stores these gems inside its body, and if slain, the gems are visible among the shards of the creature's corpse. Because of this reproductive need for gemstones, crysmals are relentless in their pursuit of the treasures, valuing them much as other living creatures value infants of their own race. Crysmals do not recognize that other creatures treat gems as wealth, and attempt to seize gems carried by others whenever the opportunity arises. A crysmal normally uses its spell-like abilities to befuddle opponents, grabbing at pouches with gems when the bearer is distracted, and normally only resorts to physical violence once all other tactics fail.",800

Crystallis,12,outsider,any,"This massive creature appears to be formed of quartz, earth, and crystal and stands about 13 feet tall. Its powerful arms and legs end in razor-sharp claws that glint and shine like polished steel. Its large rounded head sports two sunken crystalline eyes and a gaping toothless maw.","Crystallis are massive elementals from the Plane of Elemental Earth. On their home plane they spend time hunting and feeding on quartz and other precious stones. Crystallis are solitary creatures and do not normally associate with others of their kind or with other earth creatures. No one recalls ever seeing more than one of these creatures at the same time so how these creatures mate and reproduce is open for much speculation. Sometimes a powerful spellcaster binds or summons a crystallis to its plane to do its bidding. The crystallis doesn't normally mind such a calling as it gives it a chance to hunt, collect, and devour precious stones on other worlds. A crystallis stands 13 feet tall and weighs around 3,000 pounds. Its body is thickly built and formed of tightly packed earth mixed with quartz and other precious stones and gems. A crystallis attacks by raking and slashing its opponents with its razorsharp claws, while at the same time attempting to position itself near as mof its foes as possible so it can use its petrification special attack.

Cyclops,5,humanoid,temperate or tropical,"A single huge eye stares from the forehead of this nine-foot-tall giant. Below this sole orb, an even larger mouth gapes like a cave.","Mthousands of years ago, the solemn cyclopes ruled vast kingdoms, yet today their glories are long forgotten. What few cyclopes survive seldom aspire higher than protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals. This latter task occupies a great deal of their focus, for the monstrous appetites and vacuous hunger of the cyclopes control the race's destiny and may have led to their original downfall so long ago. The average cyclops stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Both males and females are almost completely bald, with stringy patches of dark hair occasionally hanging down from above the ears. A bushy, expressive brow couples with a cyclops's massive eye to make the creature's attitude easily known. Cyclopean history is a vanishing thing inscribed on the crumbling walls of vine-choked lost cities that fell long before even the rise of the elves, when dragons and giants ruled a landscape unspoiled by the petty ephemeral races that rule today. Because things have fallen so far, a given cyclops is less likely to know the near-mythic triumphs of lost ages than even a semi-educated human. Ancient records, the oral traditions of other giantish races, and the scattered accounts of tribal natives of the southern jungles speak of much larger, more primal ""great cyclopes,"" imposing titans with shaggy legs and a massive horn above an inquisitive eye. These creatures are thought to have been either the leaders or the war beasts of the ancient race, and modern cyclopes honor them as elusive, destructive living gods.",1600
Cythnigot,2,outsider,any,This six-legged horror has a spider's face and a fibrous stalk growing out of its back-a stalk ending in a snapping mouth.,"The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives within the corpses of small animals. The fungus transforms the host corpse in hideous ways, adding legs or rearranging features-a rat might gain an extra pair of legs and an insectoid visage, while a cat could lose all its legs and fur and gain a snake-like body. The only thing that all cythnigots have in common is a long stalk of fungal material that extends up from the creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws. A cythnigot without a host body appears as little more than a foul-smelling puff ball the size of a human's fist. Chaotic evil spellcasters of caster level 7th who have the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cythnigot as a familiar-to do so, the spellcaster must already have a Tiny animal as a familiar.

Cytillipede,6,magical beast,underground,"This long, segmented creature writhes and twists, its chitinous body covered in patches of glowing blue fungus. Its mandibles splatter syrupy bluish venom around it as they twitch violently in search of prey.","Derros have long used other creatures in their experiments with alchemical and magical augmentations. For the most part, these experiments are not altogether failures, though they don't usually have the results the derros had in mind. However, on rare occasions they actually get it right. The cytillipede is one of those rare occasions. For years, they adapted the diet of a species of giant centipede to eat nothing but cytillesh fungus. After years of exposure to the fungus and certain magical augmentations, the result was an entirely new breed of giant centipedes that the derros named cytillipedes. A cytillipede has a gray segmented body of hard chitin. Patches of cytillesh fungus grow along its back, which gives the creature an eerie blue glow. Because of its constant glowing, a cytillipede out in the open is fairly easy to spot. Most of the time, a cytillipede is encountered in the compof derro patrols that use their creations as mounts or to guard their lairs. In combat, a cytillipede simply rushes at its opponent and makes bite attacks, relying on its cytillesh venom to stun its enemies so it can bite them repeatedly while they deal with the disorientation of sudden short-term memory loss. A cytillipede normally only uses its cytillesh flash ability when it has been seriously wounded or threatened by multiple opponents. A trained cytillipede may also be commanded to use this ability by its rider. Because of their long exposure to cytillesh, derros are unaffected by the cytillesh-based attacks of cytillipedes. Cytillipedes are usually encountered as part of a derro patrol around a derro lair. A typical cytillipede is a little over 10 feet long and 3-1/2 feet high, and weighs about 600 pounds.",2400

Dancer Inphidian,3,monstrous humanoid,warm forests or plains or underground,"A shapely feminine humanoid with pale bluish green scales sways in lithe and elegant rhythm. As she moves, her forked tongue flickers and her eyes burn crimson. Where her hands should be, a viper head sprouts from each wrist.","Sometimes referred to derogatorily as snake charmers, dancer inphidians are found throughout the inphidian communities and act as entertainers, often using their dancing ability to soothe onlookers. Dancers also function as spies, using their ability to fascinate to extract information from a target. They are sometimes used by more powerful inphidians to seduce enemies, and rumors speak of a great city where a single inphidian ruler keeps a personal harem of dancer in his palace. The dancer inphidian prefers to avoid combat if possible, relying on her entrancing ability to fascinate her opponents. Fascinated opponents are then left to the dancer's retinue . If forced into melee, the dancer, like her brethren, relies on her snake-hands and poison to slay her opponents. If overwhelmed, a dancer attempts to flee by means possible.

Dandasuka,5,outsider,any,"This small creature looks like a well-dressed and jewelry-bedecked fiendish gnome, its face mostly mouth and fangs.","Dandasukas, also known as ""biters"" among rakshasas, serve as spies and assassins. They often appear as part of a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully, laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims. All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely amusing for the victim. Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's body, making the creature crave humanoid flesh and blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a bite out of a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must, but it always prefers humanoid flesh. Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance. Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as best they can, though their employers would still do well to keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such as idle wishes that a certain person were dead. Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny baubles. Most of them wear as much jewelry as they possibly can without looking ridiculous, and some cross that line. A dandasuka is 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.",1600
Daraka Demon,12,outsider,any,This creature is a tall black-skinned humanoid. Its head is that of a black-furred ram with downward curving horns. Its body appears to be a mass of writhing flesh.,"Darakas act as guards to the greater demons or as shock troops in the demonic armies of the Abyss. Being intelligent, they are often used as commanders or leaders, with each daraka having a battalion of minor demons at its command. A daraka's skin is leathery and oily. From a distance greater than 10 feet, its body appears to be a mass of writhing flesh. Closer inspection reveals thousands of tiny scorpions swarming its flesh. They constantly skitter across the daraka's body-into and out of its mouth, ears, and nose. The daraka doesn't even seem to notice them. Darakas stand 9 feet tall and weigh 700 pounds. Darakas aggressively assault creature that stands in their way. They usually open combat by slinging scorpions at their opponents and using chaos hammer against lawful-aligned opponents. Against an enemy wizard, a daraka uses feeblemind as soon as it can. The remainder of the combat sees the daraka slash with its claws and bite with its terrible fangs. If it can, a daraka likes to grapple a foe and let the scorpions on its body bite the grabbed opponent. A daraka's natural weapons, as well as weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",19200
Dark Creeper,2,humanoid,underground,"This creature resembles a small humanoid with a light, thin frame. It has gray skin and stark-white eyes with gray pupils. It is dressed in brownish-black filthy clothing. The smell of dung and rotted meat hangs in the air around it.","Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark. Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged. For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement- to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled. Dark Creeper Society It is known that subterranean cities of dark creepers exist. Most creatures that have seen these cities venture no closer than necessary, for the route to the city is often lined with traps, snares, and other deadly devices to detour would-be trespassers. Each city is a large circular pit with a spiraling staircase leading down to the multi-layered city. A dark creeper city is constantly shrouded in a cloud of impenetrable darkness. The actual habitat and details of dark creeper society remain a mystery, as those that have ventured into a dark creeper city have yet to return and tell of their exploits. It is believed that the race known as dark stalkers are the leaders of such cities. Dark Creeper Characters Dark creepers possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.

Dark Naga,8,aberration,underground,"A sharp-featured humanoid head crowns the powerful, sinuous body of this snake-like monstrosity.","Dark nagas covet luxury, wealth, and power over others. With bodies covered by shimmering, eel-like black scales, dark nagas slither deftly through forsaken lands and abandoned ruins, scouring such places for treasures and weaker creatures they might force into service. Their forked tongues spread only lies, and others whom they can't manipulate they destroy with their insidious poison and destructive magical abilities. A typical dark naga measures approximately 12 feet long and weighs upward of 300 pounds. Arrogant and sybaritic, dark nagas seek to dominate lesser creatures, relishing the fear they inspire and power over other beings. While some manage to carve indulgent fiefdoms from tribes of goblins, orcs, lizardfolk, or other barbarous races, the luster of cosmopolitan fineries proves enticing as well, leading some to infiltrate city sewers and slums to gather an urban following. They particularly relish morbidly crafted jewelry and treasures, often adorning themselves with jeweled bands or taking their ease atop piles of treasure. Dark nagas hate others of their kind, especially other dark nagas, seeing their brethren as deadly opponents to be dispatched swiftly and mercilessly-often rightly so.",4800
Dark Slayer,3,humanoid,underground,This small humanoid is clothed in tattered rags from head to foot. Only its sinister eyes and pale hands are visible.,"Dark slayers are a relatively rare sub-race of the dark folk imbued with malign energies that grant them a suite of deadly spell-like abilities beyond those normally accessible to their kin. They are usually encountered leading small bands of dark creepers, and seethe with barely concealed envy of the dark stalkers, ever scheming to displace them and claim a dark folk tribe of their own. Dark stalkers direct the slayers for their own ends, grooming them for use against enemies, ever ready to sacrifice a slayer in battle for an advantage, however temporary. Unlike other dark folk, dark slayers embrace their evil impulses. Their pleasures extend more to murder and pain than to theft or mayhem. Dark slayers are obsessed with magical trinkets, coveting them above all else. Sadly, their obsessive need to fiddle and tinker often leaves their pretties broken or depleted. Dark slayers stand just short of 4 feet tall and weigh 50 pounds. Most have a persistent tremor visible in their hands, stilled only when fondling a newfound magic item. Their skin is dead white, dry, and hot to the touch; their eyes are dark and narrow. Dark slayers wear salvaged rags like dark creepers do, but they discard the rags when they grow too tattered or foul-smelling.",800
Dark Stalker,4,humanoid,underground,This creature appears as a man-sized humanoid with pallid skin. It is clothed in filthy and tattered robes of blackish-gray. The stench of rotted meat and dung clings to this creature.,"The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are the undisputed leaders of dark folk society. Deep underground, these creatures dwell in strange villages  built of stone and fungus in remote caverns where they are served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive kin, the dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but when they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures such that it never ends well for those they seek to rob or torment. Dark stalkers are tall, frail humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They constantly wear multiple layers of dark cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser kin, a dark stalker's garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries a pair of short swords-they prefer these weapons to all others. Dark stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. In a fight, dark stalkers are not above sacrificing lesser creatures, including dark creepers, to win the day or cover their retreat if things go poorly. They hate well-lit areas and always prefer to fight under the cover of deeper darkness. Dark stalkers rarely fight to the death if it can be avoided, preferring to slip away if things begin to look grim. The origins of the dark stalkers and the dark creepers are shrouded in mystery, made more difficult to decipher by the fact that the dark stalkers do not keep records of their history. Mscholars believe that, just as the drow descended from elves, so too must the dark folk have descended from humanity, their eerie powers and spell-like abilities the result of generation upon generation of devotion to profane and sinister magic. Alas, the truth of the race's history may never be known. Dark Stalker Society Wherever a dark creeper city is located, dark stalkers can be found. They are the leaders of the dark creepers and rule with a strong fist. They are ruthless masters, dominating those lesser than themselves . In times of labor or war, dark stalkers can be seen standing over their dark creeper forces, directing them with a bellowing voice and threats of death to those that fail in their tasks. Some dark creepers have been observed sacrificing items to a dark stalker as if through worship. Whether the lesser creepers view the dark stalkers as deities, however, is a matter of conjecture.

Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath,12,aberration,temperate forests or swamps,"The lumbering bulk of a treelike monster lurches out of the mist, its branches tentacles, its roots ending in hooves, and its trunk decorated with numerous drooling maws.","The Elder God known in whispered circles as Shub- Niggurath is reputed to have a thousand young, when in fact her spawn are myriad. Yet some of her children are more fecund and successful than others, and the monstrosities known as her dark young are perhaps the best known of this legion of monstrosities. In combat, a dark young usually starts by using entangle and command plants to seize control of the surrounding terrain-its ability to constantly use freedom of movement affords it mobility through such regions, allowing it to move through the areas and select its prey with ease. Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spell-casters are more difficult to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as surely as across land. Ecology A dark young superficially resembles a tree, and while it possesses magic that allows it some ability to appear as a tree or to control the plants of the trackless forests it favors, upon close inspection a dark young is manifestly something far more than a mere tree. Even the smallest of these creatures stand taller than a house, while the largest of them shake the very earth with their cloven hooves and crush cities and forests alike with their passage. A typical dark young of Shub-Niggurath stands nearly 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds, but mare much larger. While most are encountered in temperate regions, they can also be found in subarctic or tropical forests. These dark young appear no different than their temperatedwelling kin, but when they use their tree shape ability, they assume the forms of plants native to the region. Habitat & Society Dark young prefer to dwell in large wilderness regions, particularly within temperate woodlands or swamps. While their presence amid cults of Shub-Niggurath have given rise to assumptions that these foul lunatics possess strange secrets that allow them to conjure the dark young to serve their cabals as guardians, in fact the reverse is true. Cultists of Shub-Niggurath often seek out the dark young and offer themselves to the creatures in sacrifice, in hopes of either being transported to the embrace of their goddess Shub-Niggurath in the process of being digested or impressing the dark young with their devotion so they might be granted reincarnation as one of them-or simply out of madness. In most cases, these offerings end poorly for the cultist, for the dark young of Shub- Niggurath are ravenous-the numerous sucking mouths that stud their trunks drain blood, drink flesh, and devour life rapidly, causing the victim's body to wither and atrophy. Often, a dark young takes pains to avoid damaging those it grabs and holds against its hungry flanks, for a living, squirming meal is so much more delicious than a lifeless husk. Those drained to zero Strength by a dark young are sometimes left hideously alive, perhaps draped across high branches in a tree where the paralyzed victim has no choice but a slow death from thirst and exposure, or maybe left for hungrier jaws in the woods amid the cloven prints and pools of thick green waste that drain from these creatures as they feed. Yet not all cultists who seek the dark young meet such ends, for some of the dark young have strange needs and uses for mortal minions. These dark young serve as objects of veneration and obsession for their cults, and happily accept their sacrifices in Shub-Niggurath's name, even though most dark young themselves feel no great debt of loyalty to their fecund progenitor. The actual uses the dark young put their cults to vary wildly-these aberrations are quite intelligent, and mhave their own goals and plans that are made much easier to achieve with the addition of a blindly loyal cult. Most dark young merely enjoy the idea of being worshiped as a god, while others stand apart from their kin and do feel a strong link to Shub-Niggurath, seeing these cults as a way to honor their inhuman mother with mortal minions. Yet the dark young of Shub-Niggurath are the spawn of a body and mind alien to most forms of mortal life, and as such the majority of these monsters have plans and goals that may seem nonsensical at best  or wantonly destructive at worst . It's rare for the cultists themselves to be privy to the dark young's reasoning, and most worshipers content themselves with their own interpretations of why they serve one of the Thousand Young.",19200
Darkmantle,1,magical beast,underground,"As this creature falls from the cavern roof, it opens like a hideous octopus, its thin, hook-lined tentacles connected by a fleshy web.","A darkmantle's tentacle-span measures just under 5 feet- when attached to a cave roof and disguised as a stalactite, its length varies from 2 to 3 feet. A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings. The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured . The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see. Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle. A darkmantle's life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a signif icant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. waters caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds.",400
Darnoc,6,undead,any,This entity appears as a translucent humanoid whose face is twisted in an evil scowl. Its eyes burn with a hellish red glow.,"The darnoc is a corrupting evil presence whose very touch sucks the life from an opponent bit by painful bit. The darnoc are said to be the restless spirits of oppressive, cruel, and power hungry individuals cursed forever to a life of monotony and toil, forbidden by the gods to taste the spoils of the afterlife they so desperately craved in life. Often seen in the clothes and guise it wore in life, a darnoc often walks the same halls and repeats the same actions of its insipid existence over and over again. Due to their great greed, a darnoc may be found within its treasury endlessly counting its coins, or within a graveyard noting the headstones of its vanquished foes with cruel mirth. When distracted from its reverie of its remembered past life, the creature flies into an inconsolable rage, often lashing out without warning or provocation at the first individual who attempts to speak to it.

Rather, daughters of Urgathoa are selected by the fickle goddess herself, chosen from her most zealous and accomplished priestesses only at the moment of their deaths. Even after their transformations into things of pestilence and dead flesh, daughters of Urgathoa remain social beings who typically surround themselves with fanatical cults.",4800
Deadfall Scorpion,8,vermin,temperate forests,Thick sheets of moss and other forests debris cling to the dark green carapace of this huge scorpion.,"The enormous deadfall scorpion is disturbingly stealthy for a creature of its size. So named for the creatures' habit of making their lairs amid the hollows created by deadfalls of old trees, deadfall scorpions adorn their already camouf laged carapaces with moss and old branches, then lie in wait to ambush prey when it draws near. They prefer to drag their prey back to their hidden deadfall lairs to eat, and thus incidental treasure can often be found within such a den. A deadfall scorpion is 24 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.",4800
Deadly Mantis,11,vermin,tropical jungles,"This terrifying monstrosity towers taller than the mightiest junglestrees, its forelimbs raised in a meditative, deadly stance.","The legendary deadly mantis stalks the deepest jungles of Mediogalti Island and the Mwangi Expanse. Tales about this lethal predator preying upon such mammoth creatures as drakes and giants frighten even the bravest hunters. Deadly mantises are sacred to the followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God, who keep the massive beasts well fed, and bring them sacrificial victims and livestock. Followers of Achaekek have also been known to serve as protectors of the dens of deadly mantises. Though creatures of this size and power obviously need no guardians, the devout followers guard their lairs and prevent adventurers from slaying the mighty insects.

Death Worm,6,magical beast,"warm deserts, plains, or hills","This large worm's body is muscular and scaly, its mouth a nightmare of row upon row of triangular teeth.","The reclusive death worm is much feared in the deserts, badlands, and steppes in which it dwells, for it brings to a battle multiple harrowing ways of inf licting death upon its foes-acid, lightning, poison, and its ravenous jaws. The creatures are remarkably good at hiding amid the sands and rocks of their favored terrain, and devilishly eff icient at selecting foes that they can easily kill. This combination makes stories of these creatures hard to conf irm, and in most urban centers, common wisdom is that the tales of death worms are fabrications- attempts to impress city folk or hallucinations born of too much drink. A death worm is 15 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds- although rumors of much larger death worms persist.",2400

Deathtrap Ooze,8,ooze,underground,The killing blade of this horrific trap drips with an animated sheen of foul brown-orange slime.,"A deathtrap ooze is a disgusting mass of brown-orange sludge that moves and hunts of its own volition. It exists only to feed. Thought to be related to ochre jellies, the deathtrap ooze is up to 12 feet wide and 6 inches deep in its normal, mobile form. While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass. Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other oozes-they prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks creative ability-it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered. These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians. Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain poison. Some even claim there are oozes so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts.",4800
Deathweb,6,undead,any,This animated husk from an enormous spider seems filled with thousands of living spiders that fall from its body like drops of blood.,"A deathweb is the undead exoskeleton of a massive spider animated with the vilest necromancy. The spells that create this monstrosity bind to it thousands of normal spiders, which together form the mind of the undead beast like an arachnid hive. These smaller spiders live in and direct their exoskeleton home, working together to swarm around the deathweb and weave its web sheets. The exoskeleton of a deathweb is cracked and full of holes to allow the resident spiders easy passage into and out of it. Although the exoskeleton can be up to 10 feet long, the largest spiders within are only 6 inches in length. The variety in the sizes of the internal spiders allows them to ably move all parts of the exoskeleton, giving the massive carapace amazing dexterity and swiftness, as well as cleverness, perception, and presence. These capabilities make deathwebs resourceful and frightening opponents, especially when adversaries mistake them for normal monstrous arachnids or mindless undead. Because of their ability to squeeze into tight surroundings, deathwebs may be found lurking in all manner of niches. Deathwebs lair where they can build webs to trap passersby, such as among thick trees or in caves or tunnels. The creatures don't actively collect valuables, but they kill indiscriminately to feed the multitude of spiders within. Webs in a deathweb's lair are thus likely to contain valuables despite the creature's lack of interest in wealth.",2400
Decapus,4,aberration,temperate forests or underground,"This swollen cephalopod has ten writhing tentacles and a hideously monstrous face with pale, milky eyes on its bulbous body.","Named for its resemblance to a 10-armed octopus, the strange decapus is one of mbizarre creatures that hail from the deepest caverns of the world. When they are encountered aboveground, their affinity for forests  suggests that their original source might be some strange, deep underground cavern wherein magical jungles grow. The decapus is a fairly intelligent creature-an ambush predator that makes excellent use of its ability to weave magical visual illusions and to imitate the voices of other creatures it has heard speaking. Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short  sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know. The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forests canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed. The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available-the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old-although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans. A typical decapus has a legspan of 8 feet and weighs 200 pounds.",1200
Deep Hunter Sea Serpent,22,dragon,waters,"The serpent is about 60 feet long and 10 feet thick. Its body scales are smooth, each about the size of a large shield, and the entire serpent is deep green to jet black in color, with eyes a solid, nearly black red color.","The immense deep hunter serpent lives in deep oceans, and delights in hunting down and killing the most fearsome creatures of the sea. The deep hunter lives on the oceans floor, usually near thermal vents and volcanic areas where it is relatively warm. However, when hunting it may be encountered just about anywhere at sea; its preferred prey are krakens and the largest whales, though it may attack other fearsome sea predator-the more dangerous, the better. The deep hunter sea serpent is seldom seen near the surface, as its prey tends to stick to deep waters. It does not initiate combat against creatures it sees as its inferiors, but if it does regard a creature as a threat, it uses stealth to surprise its prey when possible, and launches into a full-scale assault using all of its physical attacks to the best of its ability.

Deep Sea Serpent,19,magical beast,oceans,"This enormous, waters-dwelling serpent has bright, bulging eyes and rounded jaws filled with long, jagged teeth.","An enormous monstrosity that makes its home in the darkest depths of the oceans's trenches, the deep sea serpent is as elusive as it is terrifying, the nightmare of sailors making their ways over the vast and seemingly bottomless waters. A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes to be seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious reasons for occasionally coming to the surface. At other times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious-the deep sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls. It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the underwaters world, even more powerful deep sea serpents exist, beasts with supernatural luminous lures that can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even outright slay prey with a single stroke. Yet perhaps the most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea serpents that possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both their naturally elusive natures and the remote reality of their habitats mean that ensuring the veracity of these claims requires truly extraordinary efforts. A typical deep sea serpent measures 50 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds.",204800
Deer,0.25,animal,temperate forests,The elegant creature raises it head revealing a majestic rack of antlers. It has a tawny brown hide and small black hooves.,"Shy and wary, deer range from the arctic to the tropics. They are very flexible creatures, adapting easily to their climate and able to survive in all but the harshest of temperatures. Deer are very flexible in their diets as well, able to exist on plants, insects, fish, and even dead birds. Deer are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim to a distance of five miles in the waters. These statistics represent the typical white-tailed deer; they can also be used to represent other deer-like animals such as caribou and antelope. Deer attack with their hooves or antlers. Antelopes, when defending their herd, attack by charging an opponent and butting with their horns . The gore attack only applies to bucks with antlers. Black-Tailed Deer The statistics above can be used to represent the average black-tailed deer as well, with a few minor changes. The black-tailed deer prefers plains, hills, and other open ground as its habitat. It has a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. In combat, a black-tailed deer jumps about in an effort to confuse its attackers before stotting  away. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",100

Demi-lich,14,undead,any,"What at first appears to be a simple uninteresting humanoid skull suddenly rises from its resting place, turning slowly in your direction to reveal gems inset in its eye sockets and jaw, and releasing a maniacal cackle.","A demi-lich is an advanced lich of great power. When the life force of a lich ceases to exist and the material body finally decays , the soul lingers in the area and slowly over time possesses all that remains of the lich-its skull. The eye sockets and teeth of a demi-lich-possessed skull transform into clear gemstones . The skull contains a single gemstone in each eye socket and six gems in place of its teeth. A demi-lich rarely if ever wanders from its place of origin . Content to remain hidden and oblivious to the outside world, a demi-lich spends its time contemplating its past life, its accomplishments, as yet unachieved goals, and exploring strange mysteries of the cosmos. These creatures are solitary by nature and rarely associate with other creatures, including other undead, unless it is employing such creatures to further some unfinished goal. Demi-lich lairs are usually well-hidden dungeons and caverns consisting of winding corridors, deadly pitfalls, and intricate traps . A demi-lich appears as a simple humanoid skull seated amid a pile of bones and dust. In each eye socket is a single gemstone, and in its mouth, in place of its teeth, are six more gemstones. A demi-lich sits idly in its lair until touched or bothered at which point it rises vertically and uses its wail of the banshee power against the opponent it deems most threatening. On its next turn, the demi-lich uses its trap the soul ability against an opponent. It spends the remainder of combat alternating between its wail of the banshee, bestow curse, and trap the soul abilities.

Demilich,14,undead,any,Glittering jewels encrust this leering skull as it floats up into the air on a swirling vortex of dust and shimmering magic.,"In their endless years of unlife, some liches lose themselves in introspection, and can no longer rouse themselves to face the endless march of days. Still others cast their consciousness far from their bodies, wandering planes and realities far beyond mortal ken. Absent the vitality of the soul, such a lich's physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the lich's skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the lich's remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the lich's intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the lich's will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than steel. The lich's greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the lich's eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from defiling its final rest. The lich's phylactery invariably fails during the slow decline of lich into demilich, losing its last vestiges of enchantment if not crumbling into dust with the lich's body. But even without the preserving power of the phylactery, demiliches retain a tenacious grip on existence. Only powerful and precise use of magic can permanently destroy a demilich and its remains. To the unwary adventurer, a demilich looks like nothing more than dust and bones within the lich's former sanctum. Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich's possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich's slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its wail of the banshee before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough flee. BECOMING A DEMILICH Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a demilich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the lich's body decays, the lich's intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the lich's consciousness, keeping the lich trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the lich's remains are destroyed or scattered , the lich's phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the lich to life. But if the lich's remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery's magic fails catastrophically, releasing the lich's soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the lich, allowing the last remnants of the lich's soul to transform it into a demilich. The lich's soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever. For wandering liches, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the lich spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the lich's body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the lich tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the lich's phylactery fail before the wandering lich returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the lich's mind is doomed to wander until the end of days. AWAKENED DEMILICHES Under exceptional conditions, a lich's full consciousness survives its transformation into a demilich, or a lich's wandering intellect manages to return to its jeweled skull. Such creatures are awakened demiliches, and combine the powers and near-invulnerability of a demilich with the mind and spellcasting prowess of a lich. An awakened demilich has the full spellcasting abilities of the lich it was before, and gains Eschew Materials and Still Spell as bonus feats. Awakened liches keep their original lich Hit Dice, and mental attributes that are higher than the demilich's minimums. They otherwise have all the special abilities and defenses of a demilich, and no abilities of the original lich beyond spellcasting and mental attributes. An awakened demilich has a CR of 16, or the CR of the original lich + 3, whichever is higher.",36400

Demonic Knight,12,outsider,any,This creature appears as a man-sized humanoid dressed in black iron armor. Its head is completely hidden behind a dull black helm.,"The demonic knight-known by some as a death knight-is rumored to be the creation of the great demon prince Orcus, the Prince of the Undead. Some sages doubt the validity of such a claim, since the demonic knights are not undead. Though no link has been proven, however, it is known that three of the most powerful demonic knights  make their home on the same plane of the Abyss as the Prince of the Undead within the shadows of his great citadel. The true origins of the demonic knight lay hidden deep in the stinking pits of the Abyss, and those brave few who have dared search for these secrets have never returned. The demonic knights serve their master  with unswerving loyalty. They never question their orders and never question their superior. They are often sent to the Material Plane to recruit new bodies for their master's next plot or deception, or to punish those that have offended their lord. On some occasions, they are simply sent to another plane to corrupt and slay those that are just and good . A demonic knight appears as a 6-foot tall humanoid dressed in black iron half-plate armor. Its head is completely hidden beneath a helmet that it never removes. A black iron longsword is slung at its hip. Some demonic knights don capes and other decorations as a badge of station. It is unknown exactly how mdemonic knights exist, but they are believed to number no more than nine. A demonic knight attacks using its longsword . Against powerful opponents, it attempts to use its breath of unlife to weaken its foes before slaying them. If melee goes against the demonic knight, it summons demons to aid it or cover its escape.

Small bat wings protrude from her shoulders, and tiny horns jut from her forehead, just above her eyes.","Demoriel was once a powerful angel that made her home in the heavens among the other angels. In the Celestial Hierarchy she was a member of the Cherubim and served alongside Gabriel, Raphael, and Ophaniel. During the Unholy Schism, she sided with Lucifer and aided him by seducing another Cherub wherein Lucifer caught the angel unaware and murdered him on the spot. When Lucifer was thrown down from the good-aligned planes, Demoriel was beside him; cast out for the sin of slaying another angel and spilling the blood of an angel in the outer planes. When Lucifer envisioned Hell, Demoriel envisioned herself on the throne next to him, serving as Hell's Queen. Unfortunately for her, she became one of his mconcubines but never his bride, for the Great Uprising occurred in Hell and the other arch-devils moved to destroy Lucifer and his court. When Lucifer was removed from Hell's Throne and took up residence in a pocket plane called Infernus, Demoriel followed. Once again, she was denied her place on the throne next to Lucifer as he took a devil named Shabiri as his consort. Though Demoriel remains ever loyal to Lucifer, she does not trust nor like Shabiri. For now she waits until her time comes when she can discredit or destroy Shabiri and replace her as Lucifer's consort. Though Lucifer no longer rules Hell, Demoriel still serves him unswervingly. She follows no other, though she is more than willing to lead other creatures to their demise by feigning loyalty to them. She has a particularly vile hatred for celestials  and enjoys corrupting and destroying them. Demoriel attacks with her spell-like abilities, attempting to charm the strongest opponents she faces. If forced into melee, she attacks with her spell-like abilities and short sword or summons other devils to fight for her while she maintains a position away from the immediate fight.

Derhii resemble gorillas with the enormous black-and-gray wings of buzzards or vultures. They stand 9 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds. Derhii form relatively small groupings known as troops, which usually consist of a single adult male, several adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, multiple males or females band together in single-gender troops with no young, but such groupings are usually formed for a specific purpose, such as hunting, raiding, or war, and break up when they have fulfilled that purpose. Multiple troops of derhii form large primitive tribes, usually under the rule of a single powerful chieftain. Derhii often roost in junglescanopies and in cliff dwellings, preferring nests woven in tall trees or cliff-side caves high above ground level. From these roosts, derhii sometimes demand tribute from lesser apes, while allying themselves with even more powerful flying creatures, such as dragons or dragonnes. Occasionally, derhii can be found inhabiting crumbling and overgrown ruins hidden deep in the jungles. Derhii are carnivorous by nature and hunters by preference, attacking prey from high above with javelins thrown from their powerful arms before descending to finish things off with their blades, but when meat is scarce, they eat fruits and roots or whatever else they can forage.",1600

Derros often abduct surface dwellers to perform hideous experiments on them in their neverending quest to divine what protects those who dwell above from the burning death, yet the intrinsic madness that plagues all derros dooms these experiments to failure every time. In the end, traumatized victims are returned to their homes, memories not quite completely wiped of their ordeal, to live the rest of their lives in vague fear of a nightmare they can't quite recall.

Among these tools are the souls of unabashedly depraved and hateful mortals sentenced to Hell in punishment for lives of sin. The foulest of these souls occasionally find themselves plucked from their torments and reforged in infernal crucibles, etched with bindings of hellish magic, then set loose upon the living. These evil souls bear mof the powers of devils, but fall outside the normal infernal hierarchies, not being considered true devils by their fiendish peers. Rather, they are gidims, Hell-bound souls made weapons of the Pit. More than mere souls yet less than fiends, gidims find themselves barred from the mortal plane by the laws of existence. Their minds and memories linger on half-forgotten lives, however, and upon emotions and sensations long lost to fiends. Thus, they endlessly seek ways to infiltrate the paths of the living. Traveling to the Ethereal Plane, they peer into the Material Plane, seeking out hapless mortals and drawing power from their hatred, their violence, their sorrow, and especially their fears. Continued feeding upon and encouragement of such emotions grants them greater ability to invade the mortal realm and potentially steal new bodies, through which their foulness might live again. Two breeds of gidim exist, lesser possession devils and greater. Both appear nearly identical, but greater possession devils are created from spirits of extraordinary, near-legendary evil beings. These foulest of souls are granted even more powerful diabolical abilities and are often loosed by their infernal masters to torment, unhinge, and ultimately destroy the mortal enemies of Hell.

Dimensional Shambler,8,outsider,any,"This rugose figure rears up to a man's height, its large hands bearing far too mtwitching fingers.","The dimensional shambler is a vagabond of the realms between realms. With its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is significant indeed. A dimensional shambler is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a weird and alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full possession of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of their error, for the dimensional shambler is in fact quite agile-the weird lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation of its inhuman countenance. A dimensional shambler typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and weighs 350 pounds. Ecology As outsiders, dimensional shamblers have no need to feed-a trait that comes in handy for a creature that often finds itself adrift or lost in strange realms where food and waters does not-or perhaps cannot-exist. They are certainly most at home in regions that function similarly to most Material Plane worlds, for their bodies are built to traverse the ground. They have no inborn ability to fly, cannot breathe waters, and possess no unusual resistance to energies, and as such there are mrealms throughout the Great Beyond that are dangerous or even deadly to dimensional shamblers. Yet they are masters of traveling the planes, and instinctively avoid appearing in regions that would cause them harm. More powerful dimensional shamblers often seek out magical devices to aid them in traveling the stranger and less hospitable corners of reality. The need a dimensional shambler has for exploring the Great Beyond is not fully understood by mortal scholars. Certainly, curiosity seems to be a large part of their drive-a dimensional shambler can spend weeks or even years simply observing a particularly unusual planar feature, such as the expulsion of raw protolife from the Positive Energy Plane into the surrounding realities, the strange semianimate heavings of an Abyssal swamps giving birth to a legion of demons, or the mind-numbing violence of a reality storm deep in the Maelstrom. As chaotic evil outsiders, they are most comfortable on planes that either have no strong alignment traits or are close to chaotic evil, yet this does not prevent them from exploring realms beyond. The mind of a dimensional shambler, as with its body and mobility, is not quite ""in tune"" with mortal expectations, and it may be that what scholars have assumed is curiosity could be some other driving force. Perhaps the race instinctively travels the Great Beyond in search of a forgotten or hidden goal, or maybe the constant change of reality is something that brings them pleasure or some strange nutrition. Dimensional shamblers generally lack the wits to carry on long philosophical discussions, and are prone to attacking other creatures when they encounter them, so attempts to learn more about this mysterious race through conversation have not resulted in particularly informative results. Habitat & Society Dimensional shamblers seem to have very little interest in others of their kind. While they do not display instinctual need for violence against others of their ilk when chance brings them together, neither do they seek out their own kind for companionship. Dimensional shamblers are solitary beings, and the majority of their interactions with other forms of life are violent- they are fond of snatching creatures who are capable of comprehending their own peril and whisking them away to remote corners of the multiverse. Those few who have endured these abductions and survived to tell the tale did so either by escaping their captors and hiding, or by slaying the shamblers. In all cases, their return home has involved harrowing journeys through the Great Beyond, for the dimensional shambler is frustratingly skilled at selecting particularly remote and dangerous realms as destinations for its abductions. The fate of the majority of these victims is unknown, although circumstantial evidence indicates that the shambler itself plays a key and grisly role in the victims' doom. Spellcasters have long sought to harness the dimensional shambler's ability to accurately travel between planes. Mortal magic has traditionally found this feat a difficult one to master-plane shift is notorious for its inaccuracy, often leaving powerful effects like gate, miracle, or wish as the favored methods of safe interplanar travel. Yet the dimensional shambler seems able to navigate the unnavigable with ease, traveling between incredibly diverse and distant locations with no more difficulty than a human might have stepping out of a house into his own front yard. Unfortunately, the same mastery over dimensional travel that affords shamblers such accurate navigation allows them to resist the call of conjurers with surprising skill. In fact, by the time most spellcasters master the magic required to lure or conjure a dimensional shambler, it is often a simpler matter to use a gate spell instead. Some conjurers claim to have developed methods of attracting dimensional shamblers more easily. Through the use of blood sacrifice via a blade of purest metal and the application of exacting mathematical symbols or other complex combinations of runes, these spellcasters can call upon dimensional shamblers with relative ease. Unfortunately, the exact combination of runes, metals, and bloodshed seems different for every dimensional shambler, so once a spellcaster discovers the correct combination to lure one of these monsters, the secret that caster has uncovered is as closely guarded as her greatest treasures. The nature and availability of these secret rituals are left to the GM to determine, but such a ritual's recipe could well be worth 8,000 gp or more to an interested party.",4800
Dimetrodon,3,animal,warm forests,The massive sail on the back of this squat reptilian creature flexes and twitches as the beast stalks forward.,"A dimetrodon is a quadrupedal reptile similar in shape to a crocodile, but with a blunter snout filled with jagged, sharp teeth. Its most distinguishing feature is the massive sail that runs the length of its back. By extending or contracting the fin, the cold-blooded reptile can control its body temperature with ease. While they are not technically dinosaurs, dimetrodons are still often found dwelling in regions inhabited by such creatures. A fully grown adult dimetrodon can reach a length of up to 15 feet and weigh upward of 2,000 pounds.

Dimorphodon,1,animal,warm coastlines or forests,"A brightly colored creature swoops down to land on the branch above. Its head is overly large, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and bright, shiny eyes. The thing chirps, lashes its long thin tail, and then with a flap of leathery wings is in the air once again.","Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves. The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the waters in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger. Dimorphodon The dimorphodon is a robust pterosaur with a distinctively large skull-yet numerous hollows in the skull keep the creature's weight rather low and allow it greater agility. The dimorphodon's jaws contain two separate rows of differently shaped teeth: several larger fangs near the front  and a much larger number of smaller, sharp teeth along the rest of the jaw . This unusual combination of different teeth is why in some areas the dimorphodon is known as the ""fangbird"" or the ""vampire lizard,"" although they don't actually drink blood. Dimorphodons normally feed on fish, small reptiles, and birds, but when particularly hungry, flocks of these creatures have been known to gang up on larger prey, swooping in to bite and then retreating to watch from nearby cliff ledges or tree branches while the victim slowly succumbs to the poison. Once the creature is rendered helpless, the flock descends to eat its victim alive. Dimorphodons are particularly easy to train, and they're often used as guardians by local tribes or kept as exotic pets in larger cities. A Handle Animal check to train a dimorphodon is made with a +4 bonus, and a dimorphodon can know one bonus trick of its trainer's choice once it is fully domesticated.

An adult male dire ape stands 9 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. The dire ape attacks anything that intrudes on its territory, including other dire apes not of its troop, and does not break off the attack until the trespasser is dead or runs off. A dire ape makes no displays of toughness or warnings before it attacks- it simply leaps into action with little or no provocation, tearing at its opponents with claws and teeth.

Dire Boar,4,animal,temperate or tropical forests,The back of this horse-sized boar rises in a steep slope. Its tiny red eyes are crusted with filth and its bristly f lank crawls with f lies.,"Whereas the boar is ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the towering daeodon  is legitimately hateful and violent. Although omnivorous like its smaller kin, the daeodon prefers to feed on flesh, and its razor-sharp tusks and keen eyesight make it particularly well suited as a predator. While the daeodon is primarily a scavenger, it isn't averse to attacking smaller creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or those who stumble unwittingly into its territory. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as mounts, and orc cavalry mounted on dire boars make for a fearsome force indeed.

Why their wings disappeared and were replaced by claws is unknown. Dire corbies are omnivores but prefer a diet of fresh meat, enjoying the flesh of subterranean rodents, animals, and even other races. They are particularly fond of the flesh of bats, savoring the leathery grit of their flesh. Dire corbies hunt in flocks. They enjoy the thrill of the hunt and enjoy running their prey down, toying with it before swooping in and tearing it to shreds with their claws.

Its flesh is pale and hairless, and its eyes are vacant and white. Doppelgangers prefer infiltrating societies where they can gather wealth and inf luence, and see little point in forming cities of their own kind. Younger doppelgangers practice their skills by taking over small orc or goblin tribes, then move to more complicated societies like dwarven, elven, and human communities. Rather than making themselves targets by taking positions of leadership, they prefer to be the power behind the throne, or use multiple identities to manipulate inf luential citizens or entire guilds. Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived. They are particularly fond of invading human societies in order to indulge in their desires-some enjoy the complex dance of politics while others seek constant change in the race and gender of both themselves and their romantic companions. While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts for cruel and sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and these shapeshifters are the primary cause of the race's sinister reputation.

Doru,2,outsider,any,This disembodied and bestial head covered in lashing hair and curling horns flies through the air.,"Dorus are the divs that whisper in the night, the foul inspiration that drifts upon fetid winds, the messengers of pretender gods. Wild hair whips around a doru's six twisting horns, while a flat nose, a fanged mouth, and red glowing eyes complete the terrifying image of this bodiless monstrosity. Dorus almost always fly, preferring to stay at heights that keep them at the eye level of those with whom they would have dealings. When not flying, dorus roll across the ground in a disturbing manner, horns bouncing and teeth clattering as the creatures cackle and cartwheel, terrifying children and shocking the faint of heart. The least of the divs, dorus serve as messengers and servants of other divs and sometimes mortal spellcasters. While not strong combatants, dorus prefer to sow ruin in more subtle ways. They enjoy tainting mortals with exaggerated news and outright lies, trying to turn impressionable beings to waste and wickedness. Even if a doru fails to fully corrupt an intelligent being itself, it attempts to weaken the target's will, making the victim more pliable to future corruption and ruin. All divs have some manner of esoteric flaw in their personalities- dorus are obsessed with secrets. These covetous fiends hoard secrets and legends like a miser hoards gold. This thirst for information causes the curious dorus to enter into ridiculous bargains to obtain hidden knowledge from those they believe hold tales of special interest or value, especially when such information has the potential to aid in the corruption of future souls. Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double  agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most. Only the most precious and profane secrets have the potential to keep a doru faithful to a mortal master for more than a century. Serving greater divs or mortal spellcasters, divs deliver messages, most directly plucked from secret sources. Dorus' spell-like abilities make them excellent spies, granting them the ability to infiltrate, eavesdrop while invisible, and charm their way out of perilous situations. Those serving mortals pride themselves on manipulating their masters into furthering the divs' own ends. Mevil spellcasters seeking profane power and ancient evil secrets seek to take dorus as familiars. A neutral evil spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a doru as a familiar.",600
Dosojin,7,outsider,land,"This ancient, weathered statue of a venerable monk with a shaven head possesses an air of both reverence and patience.","Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountains passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In mregions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as mhealthy children. The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400 pounds. Ecology As creatures that symbolize travel and connections, dosojins straddle the line between the lands of the civilized and the wild, often with one foot literally in each. Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers. Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an aff inity for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely violent in an overt sense, dosojins prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost, letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict bridges. Habitat & Society Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road. While they do not reproduce in typical sense of the word, dosojins are nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as mpeople see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads, encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals with a shared goal. While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby, some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery. Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those who surpass a dosojin's challenges  earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and walking through their territories are as follows. • Mortals who respect the land and its laws shall know no harm. • Mortals who fail to show proper reverence for tradition shall not pass by a dosojin upon the first attempt. • Mortals who actively harm the natural world shall be cursed to wander it. • Mortals who stray from a dosojin's path to do harm should not expect to find that path ever again.",3200
Dracolisk,9,dragon,temperate swamps or underground,This creature resembles a young six-legged dragon with glistening scales and gleaming eyes.,"The vicious dracolisk is a rare crossbreed of dragon and basilisk. No one is quite sure how the dracolisk species came to be, but all who have encountered it are well aware of its lethality. There is believed to be one species of dracolisk for every species of dragon. Thus far, however, most dracolisks encountered have been of the black variety. At first glance, a dracolisk appears to be a juvenile dragon of whatever color its dragon parent was-but thanks to the petrifying gaze it inherited from its basilisk parent, most who encounter a dracolisk never get a second glance. A dracolisk has a scaled body the same color as its dragon parent that fades to a lighter shade on its underside. A short, curved horn, similar to a rhino's, juts from its nose. Its dragon-like wings match its body color but fade to a slightly darker shade near the tips. A dracolisk's eyes are pale green with sparkles that match its dragon-parent color. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds. A dracolisk's environment varies based on its dragon heritage: black dracolisks can be found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; blue dracolisks favor warm hills and mountains, rarely being found underground; green dracolisks favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; red dracolisks favor warm mountains and underground settings; and white dracolisks favor cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground. The dracolisk attacks first with its breath weapon and gaze attack. After this, it attacks with its bite and clawed forelegs.

Draconal,20,outsider,air,"This noble creature seems to be part serpent, part humanoid, and part dragon, with great wings and a crown of horns.","Draconals are mighty agathion lords, few in number and greatly removed from mortal affairs. They watch over powerful magic and are direct agents of the gods and the needs of the good planes. Patient and ageless, they plan for the long term, which often frustrates mortal creatures who seek to gain their assistance with a threat in the here and now. A draconal would rather support or enhance a group of heroes than tackle a problem directly, maintaining its focus on planar matters. Draconals are attuned to nature and believe in cycles of life and death. Though they are good, they understand that the presence of evil gives good creatures something to strive against, preventing stagnation and complacency. This means their outlook sometimes appears almost neutral, though they hate suffering and needless death. DRACONAL COLORS A draconal's coloration represents mystical elements relating to energy, life, and the natural world. These colors are normally chromatic rather than metallic, and an ignorant person seeing a draconal's colors may mistake her for an evil half-dragon. However, some draconals have metallic or gem-like coloration; for example, a yellow draconal may appear mustard yellow or metallic gold, while a white draconal may be chalk white, pearlescent white, or metallic silver. Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender. Black: Black is a balance between male and female energy, and represents the skies, stars, immortality, and leadership. Black draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A black draconal adds Fire, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains. Green: Green is slightly skewed toward masculinity. It represents wood, plants, and flowers. Green draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A green draconal adds Animal, Plant, and waters to its list of possible domains. Red: Red is a strongly masculine color, and most red draconals are male or have aggressive or gregarious personalities. Red represents fire, light, and warding against bad luck. Red draconals are immune to fire damage, and their breath weapon is fire. A red draconal adds Fire, Protection, and Sun to its list of possible domains. White: White is slightly skewed toward femininity, and most white draconals are female or have protective or serene personalities. White represents brightness, fulfillment, metal, mourning, and purity. White draconals are immune to cold damage, and their breath weapon is cold. A white draconal adds Artifice, Liberation, and Repose to its list of possible domains. Yellow: Like black, yellow is a balance between male and female energy. Yellow represents earth, oracles, stone, and luck. Yellow draconals are immune to acid, and their breath weapon is acid. A yellow draconal adds Earth, Glory, and Luck to its list of possible domains.",307200
Draconid,9,aberration,underground,"This hideous creature looks like a cross between a giant spider and dragon or hydra. Where its head should be, two long serpentine necks sprout from its body. Its head and neck are scaled gray, and its spidery torso and eight knobbed legs are covered in short, coarse fur.","Draconids are a hideous cross between either a giant spider and a hydra or a giant spider and a dragon. They dwell deep underground where they dine on the flesh of elves, dwarves, goblins, and just about anything else that crosses their path. These creatures are never encountered on the surface world, preferring to spend their lives underground. Draconids are solitary creatures and never mix with others of their own kind . If a draconid moves into another's territory, a fight almost always ensues as soon as they discover one another. A typical draconid hunting ground covers an area of nearly 10 miles from its lair. When not hunting, a draconid spends its time in its lair. A draconid's lair is something most disgusting and quite memorable to those that stumble across it. A tangled mess of shiny coins and gems mixed with corpses, bones, and rotted flesh. A draconid usually waits in its web until prey passes underneath or nearby. It then shoots a web, releases its breath weapon and moves into melee. Once engaged, the draconid bites with one head and breathes fire with the other. One favorite tactic is to slow larger foes with its webs while it snatches up smaller targets in its jaws and crush them, bathing them in fire, and hurling them away if they prove too troublesome.

Dragon Horse,9,magical beast,any,"The glossy alabaster coat of this noble horse ripples with muscles, while its hooves shimmer with pale blue energy.","Despite their name, dragon horses are not related to dragons. These noble creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without wings and to create different effects with their misty breath. Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise. Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy to secure the creature's aid. Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying away. When they are forced to fight , they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible.",6400
Dragon Turtle,9,dragon,temperate waters,This long-tailed waters beast resembles a massive snapping turtle with draconic features.,"Dragon turtles make their homes in both salt and freshwaters, where they rank among the biggest threats to sailors and those who travel by ship through the watersways of the world. Skilled mariners know the territory dragon turtles claim and frequently make offerings of gold and magic for safe passage or avoid the area entirely. For its part, a dragon turtle quickly grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, and a dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a dangerous foe indeed. A dragon turtle's shell varies in color between individuals. Some have dull shells of brown and rust red, while others have carapaces of a deep green-blue color with silver highlights across the rocky ridges. The coloration of the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and contains golden streaks along the crest and spines. Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles. Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible through the waters, and often decorate their lairs not only with the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves. Their territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs put them in direct conf lict with other undersea races such as merfolk and sahuagin. Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is not borne of intrinsic evil or cruelty. Dragon turtles possess shells 15 feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their powerful tails.",6400
Dragonfish,1,animal,waters,This small flat fish has brown scales mottled with black. A series of needle-like spines runs the length of the fish on its dorsal side.,"A dragonfish is a small, 2-foot long, flat fish that makes its home on the bottom of shallow lakes, rivers, or streams. The dragonfish's back is covered with long, sharp spines. A dragonfish's dorsal spines carry a virulent poison that is delivered whenever an opponent contacts a spine. They are non-aggressive and spend their days eating miniscule waters creatures, insects, and waters plants. Dragonfish are not aggressive and prefer to lie on the bottom of a body of waters, waiting for a victim to step on it so its poisonous spines penetrate the victim's flesh. If forced into melee, a dragonfish attacks with its bite. Credit The Dragonfish originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio  and is used by permission.

Dragonkin,9,dragon,mountains,"This sleek, gold-scaled draconic creature looks both regal and intelligent. A leather harness holds a saddle between its wings, and it bears a massive glaive.","Somewhere between true dragons and brute drakes lie the dragonkin. Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with humanoids. Unlike mother dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to have adopted weapons, favoring huge glaives and long lances. The most unique aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin opposed to the depredations of evil dragons in the Drakelands recognize other cultures' potential, and such individuals often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they almost seem to be one entity. When not fighting, the humanoids are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude. Built for speed, dragonkin are long and sleek. Madopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor, and this, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, sometimes disgusts true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and roughly 2,000 pounds.",6400
Dragonne,7,magical beast,temperate deserts,"This creature has the features of a lion but the wings and scales of a brass dragon, and a wild mane matching its scales.","Possessing the savage instincts of lions with the cunning of brass dragons, dragonnes combine the fiercest features of these noble creatures into predators both awe-inspiring and deadly. The origin of dragonnes generates endless speculation. The odds of these creatures being direct crossbreeds of dragons and lions are quite remote, for numerous reasons: the two creatures rarely share the same territories; few creatures as clever as brass dragons would choose to mate with simple lions; and dragonne abilities differ significantly from those of metallic dragons. While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent. Although mcreatures rightly fear these ferocious hunters, few dragonnes are blatantly evil-most are just highly territorial and seek to defend their homes and hunting grounds from interlopers. Creatures that draw too close to a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar, followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and pounce. Despite their deadliness, dragonnes form strong bonds with those they consider members of their pride, sometimes even adopting creatures of other races. A character with the Leadership feat can take a dragonne as a cohort. Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger. A dragonne measures between 10 and 12 feet long and weighs up to 1,200 pounds.",3200
Dragonnel,6,magical beast,temperate hills,"This creature looks like a great dragon, at least 20 feet long with a serpentine body, long slender wings and a pointed snout or beak that resembles that of a pteranodon. Its body is colored reddish-violet with lighter shades on its underbelly. A ridge of maroon-colored spines runs the length of its body down the center of its back. A mane of frills, white in color, rings its head.","Dragonnels are believed to be either related to dragons or an abomination of dragon and pteranodon, as they share the physical characteristics of both those monsters. Dragonnels are semi-intelligent and use this ability to their advantage when hunting or stalking prey. Dragonnels are fierce hunters, though some have been trained by evil humanoids as mounts and guardians. A typical dragonnel is about 25 feet long. A dragonnel prefers to attack from the air, flying above its prey and then plunging to strike with its claws and bite. A solitary dragonnel is usually either hunting or returning to its lair from hunting, while more than one dragonnel usually indicates a mated pair or family. In such a case, all dragonnels attack in concert with one another and usually fight to the death. Training a Dragonnel A dragonnel requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a dragonnel must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly dragonnel requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a dragonnel requires an exotic saddle. A dragonnel can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Dragonnel eggs are worth 4,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 9,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a dragonnel. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a dragonnel is up to 1,038 pounds; a medium load, 1,039-2,076 pounds, and a heavy load, 2,077-3,120 pounds.

Dragonship,10,construct,waters,"This automaton appears as a massive wooden longship sculpted to grant it a dragonlike appearance, with a scaled hull, a bow curving up to form a dragon's head, and a stern tapering to a tail.","A dragonship is an animated sailing vessel-essentially a massive wood golem in the form of a longship. It is identical to a longship in every way except that it is only 20 feet long. It has a standard square-rigged sail, and 10 oars . Using its oars or its ability to generate winds on its own, a dragonship is rarely at the mercy of the weather. It has an instinctive understanding of local sea charts and navigation routes. Its primary function is as a transport that needs no crew; it can be told one's destination and it will sail there by the quickest route possible. Although generally used as a warship, a dragonship's primary function is that of a sailing vessel. A dragonship is not particularly adept at combat and it cannot maneuver to defend itself if it is beached; in such cases it relies on its crew for defense. A dragonship bites and breathes fire with its dragon-like head, and can use up to four oars to slap at foes that approach from the flanks. As a sailing vessel a dragonship can carry up to 30 passengers and up to 35 tons of cargo. Its speed is that of a normal longship. Construction A dragonship's body is a constructed similar to a normal longship fitted with a dragon-head mounted on the bow. The ship costs 10,000 gp and the figurehead costs 1,000 gp. Also required is a volume of sea charts and maps , to be burned in the mouth of the dragonship's head upon completion of its construction. Consumed in the fire, the distilled knowledge of the sea charts provides the dragonship with its ability to navigate.

Draug,4,undead,any,"This ragged humanoid is lean and ravaged by decay with bits of bone showing beneath waterslogged, blue-green rotting flesh. Its clothes hang in tatters and its weapons are pitted and rusted.","The draug is the vengeful spirit of a ship's captain who died at sea, thus being denied a proper burial. If an entire ship sinks at sea with the loss of all hands, the ship itself and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers. The captain usually rises as a draug and his crew rises as brine zombies . A draug looks as it did in life, wearing the same clothes and bearing the same possessions it held at the moment of death. The arrival of a draug is often taken as a death portent, for even if it does not attack, some dire circumstance is likely to befall the witness. A draug often acts as a death token, rising out of the sea and staring at or pointing a bony finger at a sailor fated to drown. Draugs are jealous of the living and try to bring death and misfortune to them at every opportunity. They have been known to suddenly appear in a sea mist and climb aboard the ships of the living. A draug's favored form of attack is with its cutlass, though if disarmed it uses its claws to attempt to grapple an opponent, leaping back into the waves in an effort to drown the unfortunate victim. Draug Ships When a ship sinks beneath the waves, it and its entire crew may return as ghostly wanderers, especially if the captain and crew had a less than scrupulous profession . A sunken ship of this nature may undergo a transformation from the negative energy and evil surrounding it. When this happens, the ship rises from the deep, piloted by a draug and manned by skeletons, brine zombies, zombies, and lacedons. The ship appears as it did at the time of its demise. The sails are tattered and the decks covered with seaweed. When a draug is at the helm, the ""ghost ship"" gains the following powers: Buoyancy  Regardless of the condition of the hull, a draug-piloted ship remains afloat in weather conditions. It is not affected by wind of type  and can even sail against gale-force winds. Strong waves may toss the ship about, but will not capsize it as a result. Flight  A draug can maneuver his ship to leave the waves and take to the air as long as the draug remains on board. This functions as fly cast by a sorcerer with a caster level equal to the draug's HD. Immunity to Fire  A draug ship is so waterslogged and infused with negative energy that it is completely immune to all fire effects. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Draugr,2,undead,coastlines,"This barnacle-encrusted walking corpse looks like a zombie, but is dripping with waters and gives off a nauseating stench.","Draugr smell of decay and the sea, and drip waters wherever they go. These foul beings are usually created when humanoid creatures are lost at sea in regions haunted by evil spirits or necromantic effects. The corpses of these drowned sailors cling fiercely to unlife, attacking living creatures that intrude upon them. Their attacks smear rancid flesh, rotting seaweed, and swaths of vermin on whatever they hit. In the case of draugr who manifest when an entire ship sinks, these undead usually stay with the wreck of their ship. Some draugr may be found under the control of waters necromancers, while others may wander the seas as undead pirates aboard ghost ships. DRAUGR CAPTAIN  Draugr captains have malevolent, burning red eyes. They may be more richly dressed than other draugr, though their clothes are always in a similar tattered condition. A draugr captain is a draugr with the advanced simple template. In addition to this, most draugr captains have additional class levels, usually as barbarians, fighters, or rogues. Draugr captains can also use obscuring mist as a spell-like ability  three times per day, and instead of causing nausea with a successful hit, they bestow 1 negative level on a hit.

Dream Spectre,9,outsider,any,This creature looks like a vaguely humanoid figure composed of living shadow. White-hot pinpoints of light seem to serve as its eyes. Its arms end in wicked claws of shadowstuff and its lower torso trails off into wispy dark shadows.,"Dream spectres have their origins on a dreamscape plane plagued and flooded with nightmares. This plane is an ever-changing plane of whirling winds, matter, anti-matter, and anything else a dreaming creature injects into the realm of dreams. Dream spectres enter the Material Plane through nexus points created by dreaming creatures, and once on the Material Plane, they use their abilities to attack sleeping and dreaming creatures within their immediate area, feeding on a sleeping creature's dream energy. Once sated, a dream spectre fades into the shadows, only to return the next night. A dream spectre often haunts the same creature night after night until that creature dies or the dream spectre is discovered and flees. Dream spectres look like undead shadows and are often mistaken for them. They are not undead, or even related to undead, so a cleric's power over such creatures doesn't affect a dream spectre. Dream spectres sometimes use this case of mistaken identity to their advantage, seeming to retreat in battle all the while waiting for an opening to strike the unsuspecting cleric. A dream spectre prefers to attack sleeping creatures so it can use its Charisma damaging attack without interruption as well as destroy the target's dreams with its nightmare ability. A creature that awakens or discovers a dream spectre  is targeted by its sleep attack. Dream spectres attack with their incorporeal touch in combat. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",6400
Drekavac,3,undead,any,"Dressed in graveyard rags, this pitiful creature cries out like a sick child. An oversized, bestial head perches atop its spindly, child-sized body, and its eyes are nothing but sunken pools of shadow with no trace of life in them. A cloying mist wreathes its frail form, accompanied by the stench of death and disease.","Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where msuch deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living. Ecology Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer. Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered. The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces. It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child's crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them. Habitat & Society Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac's chillsing grasp. Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off. Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.",800
Drelb,5,outsider,any,This spectral figure is composed of darkness and has no discernible features except its eyes-two small pinpoints of light that burn with a hellish glow.,"Drelbs are energy creatures that make their home on the Negative Energy Plane.

Hence, they are sometimes referred to as haunting custodians. A drelb resembles and is nearly indistinguishable from a wraith . Drelbs are not undead and cannot be turned, though they sometimes feign being affected, using their illusory retreat ability to trick their opponents.

Dretch,2,outsider,any,"This creature's bloated frame shudders with each heaving step, yet despite its shape, the thing moves with surprising quickness.","Even the lowest demons of the Abyss are dangerous and filled with a driving need to spread ruin and dismay. The lowly dretch is as hideous and foul as it is cruel, even if it lacks the strength and power to realize its need to brutalize others in its native realm. The lot of the dretch's existence is to serve more powerful demons as victims, and only the lucky few survive long enough to evolve. The dretch is a favorite target for dabblers in Abyssal summonings to call forth. Relatively weak and easy to bully, dretches can often be pressured into long periods of servitude with only vague promises of the opportunity to vent their frustrations and anger on softer foes. Yet the prospective dretch-summoner would do well to remember that these demons are as craven and untrustworthy as they come. A dretch faced with a more powerful foe is only too eager to trade what it knows for its pitiful excuse for a life. Unlike most demons, a dretch's slovenly personality and disdain for prolonged physical labor rarely result in success. Advanced dretches are rare, but those who do find it within themselves to be more than they were at creation often become the pauper-kings of the Abyss, cruel and bitter in their rule over vermin, broken souls, mindless undead, and other dretches. Their empires are confined to abandoned stretches of sewers under backwaters cities, unstable reaches of swampsland avoided by more sensible minds, and other undesirable corners of the Abyss that even demons find uncomfortable or foul. Yet to the dretch lords, these realms are their empires, and they defend them with a pitiful tenacity. A dretch stands 4 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. Dretches typically form from the souls of slothful, evil mortals-yet it only takes a small fragment of a soul to trigger such a hideous birth. A single soul can often trigger the manifestation of a small army of dretches, and the sight of a horde of fresh-birthed dretches pulling free from the heaving protomatter of the Abyss is a nauseating and terrifying one indeed.",600
Drider,7,aberration,underground,"The dry rasping of spidery legs brings this hideous monstrosity into view-a nightmarish, centaurian fusion of drow and spider.","Created from the body of a drow, warped and mutated through special poisons and elixirs to take on the characteristics of a giant spider, the drider is a dangerous creature. Driders are sexually dimorphic. A female drider's lower spider body is sleek and graceful, often similar to a black widow's body, while its upper drow torso retains its alluring curves and beautiful face . A male drider's lower body is bulky like a tarantula, while its upper body is wiry and bears a hideous face more spider than drow, complete with fanged mandibles.",3200
Drow,0.33,humanoid,underground,"This dark-skinned elf stands in a battle-ready pose, her hair silver and eyes white and pupilless.","Drow are shorter and a bit more slender than their surface-dwelling kin, but they are otherwise physically similar. Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of. Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base stats as presented here-drow nobles are more powerful and dangerous, and are detailed on the facing page. In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, drow are quick to flee, leaving slaves and minions to cover their escape. Drow Characters Drow are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All drow have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution: Drow are nimble and manipulative. Medium: Drow are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. Normal Speed: Drow have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Drow can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Drow Immunities: Drow are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus to saves against enchantment spells. Keen Senses: Drow receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Spell Resistance: Drow possess spell resistance equal to 6 plus their class levels. Spell-Like Abilities: A drow can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using his total character level as his caster level. Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds drow for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. Poison Use: See Special Abilities, above. Weapon Familiarity: Drow are proficient with the hand crossbow, rapier, and short sword. Languages: Drow begin play speaking Elven and Undercommon. Drow with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, or Goblin. Drow Nobility About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth-the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage. Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble. Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to death-sacrificed to one of the mdemon gods to whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society's noble houses. Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid. Drow Noble Characters Drow nobles are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed above for drow characters, plus the following. +4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution.

Spell Resistance: Drow nobles have spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level. Spell-Like Abilities: Drow nobles can cast dancing lights, deeper darkness, faerie fire, feather fall, and levitate each at will, and have detect magic as a constant spell-like ability. A drow noble can also cast divine favor, dispel magic, and suggestion once per day each. In some cases, a drow noble's spell-like abilities might vary, although the level of a particular spelllike ability does not. A drow noble's caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her character level.",135
Drowning Devil,8,outsider,any,"Frail, finlike wings erupt from the back of this serpentine creature, whose head resembles that of a ram-horned, four-eyed fish, and whose muscular arms end in masses of writhing tentacles like fists made of sea anemones.","Few creatures among the hosts of Hell have as horrific a visage as a drowning devil-called a sarglagon in its own Infernal tongue. Four unblinking orange eyes stare out of its vaguely piscine head, flanked by a pair of curving ram's horns and located above a wide mouth of countless jagged teeth. Where one would expect hands or even claws, a drowning devil instead has fists of writhing, stinging tentacles, as though the infernal creature bore a pair of sea anemones as poisonous cudgels. A pair of finlike wings sprouts from the beast's shoulders, wafting like seaweed at their frayed ends. Below the waist, a drowning devil resembles a long, serpentine fish, with a fluked tail and a ridge of spines running down its back. Drowning devils take great pride in being the best-adapted guardians of Hell's watersways, and are among the few fiends who travel the seas and rivers of the multiverse as part of larger infernal plots. Though a drowning devil can function perfectly well on dry land or even in the air, it is truly a force to be reckoned with within its natural waters environment. In environment, a drowning devil moves with a haunting litheness as though it were swimming through the air or across the ground. The typical drowning devil weighs 600 pounds, and when stretched to full length, can surpass 15 feet from head to tail. Ecology Most sarglagons come into being when petitioners of Hell exhibit particular skill or passion for keeping secrets, guarding passageways, and protecting against incursions. Drowning devils are vigilant guardians whose versatility in all environments makes them ideal sentinels, especially over Hell's watersways. From the swamps of Stygia to the rivers Styx, intruders often use Hell's aqueous channels to encroach upon Hell's borders from other planes, and cowardly souls flee to these watersways in the hope of finding a route to escape their eternal torment. Thus, those lower-ranking devils who please the masters of Hell by guarding the secrets and captives that power the plane and its denizens are sometimes transformed into sarglagons, granting them better tools with which to ensure the safety and seclusion of their charges. Habitat & Society From the fetid swamps of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, rise the Academies of Lies, where the archdevil Geryon and his minions hoard secrets, lies, and valuable knowledge with which they can manipulate weaker souls throughout the planes, bringing untold numbers to the ranks of Hell. But while the osyluths actively seek these secrets and lies to swell their library-temples, drowning devils serve as the guardians of the mires that surround them, ensuring unwelcome eyes do not gaze upon the secrets that ensure Hell's dominance, and preventing oaths held tight by their masters from slipping out of the devils' grasps. Drowning devils not only serve as sentinels of Hell, but are often called by diabolists and conjurers on the Material Plane to serve as guardians of their infernal lairs, hidden treasures, or personal secrets. Gaining a sarglagon's service often comes at a high price, for a drowning devil is not likely to simply stand watch when given access to an item so valuable that it requires a fiendish guardian. Rather, the contracts required to bind them to their task typically come with strict terms defining how long the devil will serve as protector, what access it can have to that which it guards, and what portion of its charge it may claim when its service is finished. Those who wish to bind a drowning devil or call one as a planar ally find better success when the secret or treasured prize they wish the sarglagon to protect is more valuable, more damning, or ultimately more attractive to the devil, as the temptation of guarding something it can later use for its own benefit can motivate a drowning devil to bargain more flexibly, lest it risk losing access to such a prize for being too stubborn or demanding. Even then, mortals must be as vigilant as their devil servitors in order to ensure that the sarglagons are not exploiting some oversight in their negotiations. Some on the Material Plane find themselves the wards of drowning devils without personally entering into an agreement with a sarglagon. This is especially common in cases where the taint of infernal blood runs through a human's veins, or more often when a human births a tief ling child. In these instances, the devils related to the mortals contract the sarglagons to act as their proxies upon the Material Plane-agents tasked with ensuring the safety of the devils' humanoid kin. Whether the devil progenitors do this to keep their mortal offspring safe for their own far-reaching plans or out of some sense of loyalty depends on the particular instance, but for those under the care of a drowning devil, the motivations rarely matter. A sarglagon's vigilance is stif ling to one hoping to live a life of free choices and privacy, and often the greatest threat to drowning devil's charges is the charges themselves, as msee suicide as the only way to escape the constant gaze of their eerie diabolic guardian.",4800
Dryad,3,fey,temperate forests,"This strange, beautiful woman has flesh that seems made of wood and vibrant hair that resembles leaves and blossoms.","Dryads are tree-fey who prefer secluded woodlands far from humanoids in need of lumber. Dryads' main interests are their own survival and that of their beloved forests, and they have been known to magically coerce passersby into aiding them in tasks they cannot complete. They are more likely to be friendly to non-evil druids and rangers, as they recognize a mutual respect for or empathy with nature. Dryads are benign guardians of trees, and though they can do little in the way of direct violence, they can trap and disable threats to their homes or turn enemies into allies. Some keep one or more charmed humanoids in their territory to fend off or lead away attackers. Incapacitated foes are typically dragged to the edge of the forests by the dryad's allies and left there, but evil or overtly hostile ones are killed once combat is over.",800

Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds.

Duppy,7,undead,warm coastlines,"This floating, ghostly humanoid wears a cowl, but the face beneath it is a blend of human and animal, radiating hatred and fury. Transparent, canine shapes twine around its legs.","A duppy is the spirit of a cruel and brutal sailor who died by violence on land, away from his ship and crew, and thus was unable to receive a proper burial at sea. While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malignance. Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates to exact their vengeance on, seeking to inf lict great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost in life. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the oceans know to fear and hate these ghastly beings. The presence of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling. While a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it cannot be captured via mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a trap are wise to keep the horror confined until day, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.",3200

In some rare instances, especially old and well-used ebon acolyti have been known to defy their creators, but only when such masters have defied the will or tenets of their deity. Religious figures claim such rarities are not a sign of devotion from the constructs themselves, though, but instead a manifestation of a deities' will operating through a convenient medium. Habitat & Society Altar golems are typically found in places of dark worship, from the expected locations like depraved dungeons and temples consecrated in the name of sinister gods to hidden shrines under the homes of supposedly reputable neighbors or secret mountains hollows. Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti might be found. An ebon acolytus's most feared ability is its power to sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of the construct's creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm. The being an ebon acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague source fail. Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods, demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings. Those killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed. As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips, having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service should the victim's loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes. Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Mquests to unholy realms have been undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with success. Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths, though such instances are exceedingly rare. Construction An ebon acolytus is chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble, jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp. Ebon Acolytus CL 11th; Price 24,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, desecrate, trap the soul, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft  or Craft  DC 16; Cost 12,000 gp Ebon Acolyti on Golarion Though rare, ebon acolyti have been found throughout Golarion, consecrated to a host of foul patrons. While mwatch over temples and holy sites of Rovagug, Lamashtu, and Asmodeus-and peripheral shines to his archdevils-they are more commonly found in squalid holes where demon and daemon worshipers enact their blasphemous ceremonies. Below are two particularly infamous ebon acolyti. The Altar of Angazhan: Deep in the Mwangi Expanse lies an ebon acolytus dedicated to the demon lord Angazhan, the Ravener King and Lord of Apes. Carved from obsidian, the altar resembles Angazhan himself, a brutish ape with savage tusks and six long, slender fingers. Unlike other altar golems, the Altar of Angazhan speaks through the Voice of Angazhan, the animated and endlessly furious skull of a massive gorilla that serves as the construct's head. Although the skull possesses only the intellect of an average ape, it ""leads"" a pack of charau-ka that worships it as their god. The tribe's shamans interpret their lord's will in his endless grunts and howls, directing their people to scour the Expanse for food, riches, and sacrificial victims. The Midnight Temple of Egorian: Found in Cheliax's infernal capital, this massive, marble-carved ebon acolytus is known as the Black Altar. Shaped into the likeness of a humanoid devil with sweeping horns and monstrous wings, the Black Altar seems to be carved straight from the layers of Hell itself. At the stroke of midnight on the first day of every ninth week, nine slaves are sacrificed here to the God Fiend, the Black Altar absorbing their blood and sending their souls screaming to Asmodeus. When the altar prepares to kill its victims, its great wings close so none can see the final blow, and when they open again, nothing of the sacrifice remains.",3200
Ecorche,16,undead,land,"This brawny creature has had its skin completely flensed from its form, revealing the violent pulsing of its massive, exposed muscles.","The bodyguards and spies of undead masterminds, ecorches appear as gory giants with musculatures overdeveloped by infusions of necromantic toxins and grafts of reanimated sinew. Although its natural form possesses no skin, an ecorche can steal the flesh of another creature, flaying its victim in mere seconds and leaving it in unimaginable shock and pain with only moments to seek aid before perishing. Yet this gruesome act of violence is only the first stage of the chaos an ecorche spreads with its violence. An ecorche possesses incredible control over its gruesome form, allowing it to compress its body into the skin of a much smaller creature. Wearing such grisly garb, these terrors walk among the living, doing the bidding of their terrible masters or searching for more inf luential individuals to murder, skin, and impersonate. If an ecorche's unholy nature is revealed, the monster is quick to dispose of its nowuseless disguise, bursting from the suit of flesh and exposing its terrible form to the unprepared, few of whom can withstand such unabashed gore. An ecorche stands approximately 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 600 pounds.",76800
Ectoplasm,5,ooze,any,"This creature gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle, and appears to be a shimmering cloud of filaments, tendrils, and whips of eerie mist. The form of the thing continuously roils and billows like a cloud, and it is eerily silent.","Mencounters with glowing, ghostly spheres can be attributed to ectoplasms rather than restless spirits. An ectoplasm, sometimes called a ghost ooze, is a faintly glowing orb of immaterial substance that lurks in catacombs and cemeteries. Although incorrectly assumed by most to be some form of incorporeal undead, ectoplasms are quite alive. Ectoplasms dwell in places of the dead because they consume dead flesh, slowly dissolving decaying bones and skin and absorbing the nutrients directly. The strange irony of the ectoplasm is that a cemetery ‘haunted' by these creatures is almost certain to be free of corporeal undead; the ectoplasm makes a meal of them as soon as it discovers them. Ectoplasms are not undead and cannot be turned by clerics. Although its primary diet consists of the dead, an ectoplasm is also a threat to the living. An ectoplasm attacks anything within the range of its senses that disturbs it. An ectoplasm that encounters a living opponent attacks for a few rounds before attempting to escape-it senses that it can get no sustenance from the opponent. If it finds an undead opponent, an ectoplasm continues to attack until it or the opponent has been destroyed. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",1600
Ectoplasmic Human,0.5,undead,any,"This slimy, shifting mass has the shape of a humanoid, but is made out of what appears to be some form of sticky rope or cloth. Its body lurches jerkily, struggling to maintain its horrid form.","Drawn from energies of the Ethereal Plane, ectoplasm is a thick, vile substance that shapes itself into the form of an undead creature, creating a host for a soul unfortunate enough to be confined within it. The existence of an ectoplasmic being is a cruel one, and few souls willingly choose this fate of painful undeath. Ectoplasm resembles thick tangles of slimy linen or dripping goo, and is as grotesque to touch as it is to gaze upon. An ectoplasmic creature is approximately the same size as whatever body it inhabited in life, though it weighs nearly twice as much, the ropes of undead matter that compose its body being significantly heavier than most flesh. Ecology Though generally considered a fable by all but those who have had the misfortune of witnessing its horrid form, ectoplasm is as real as it is accursed. Even more so than most undead beings, creatures born of ectoplasm live hateful existences filled with a lust for destruction and suffering. They have no bodily needs and require no sustenance; the only thing an ectoplasmic creature feeds upon is its own hatred for the living. Once a spirit has passed to the afterlife, it seldom wishes to return at all, let alone in a disfigured ectoplasmic body. Spirits that are not powerful enough to come back as ghosts or spectres sometimes enter the Material Plane as ectoplasmic monsters, particularly when there are no remains of the creature's original body for its soul to inhabit so as to become a skeleton or zombie. Sometimes, ghosts and other strong undead purposefully draw upon ectoplasm from the ethereal realm, yearning for even more power in their ectoplasmic hosts. Those who suffer this unfortunate fate, either by misfortune or choice, are usually stuck in their ectoplasmic prison until death once again takes hold of them. The transition from death to ectoplasmic undeath is a torturous ordeal, as is retaining the horrid form into which the creature is reborn. Often, this persistent agony drives ectoplasmic beings mad, creating within them an insatiable rage akin to that experienced by frustrated ghosts and other haunted souls. An ectoplasmic creature's burning desperation and embitterment often push it toward violence, and most such beings fling themselves into battle willingly, killing to satiate their natural hunger for others' suffering while simultaneously hoping to be killed so as to end their own. Ectoplasmic creatures leave a trail of a silvery substance that resembles a slug's mucus, a trait almost exclusive to these undead. This slippery secretion has the consistency of jelly, and is easily distinguishable to the trained eye. The residue dries quickly, however, so its presence is extremely foreboding for those who can identify it. Habitat & Society Ectoplasmic beings can inhabit virtually location, regardless of environment or climate. The horrors tend to prowl the areas in which they died and rarely venture outside these often confined spaces. Ectoplasmic creatures are sometimes found in groups, and when they are it is because they were allies or partners in life and have chosen to come back for some joined purpose, only to be locked in the excruciating form of ectoplasmic horrors. While of average intelligence, ectoplasmic beings rarely coordinate complicated actions with their brethren, only strategizing when it benefits them to attack victims stealthily. Their unnatural strength makes ectoplasmic creatures formidable combatants, and thus all the more frightening when undetected. Fortunately for the wary, the sticky ectoplasm that trails behind these undead monsters is a clear indicator of their presence, and experienced clerics can often identify the substance at a glance.

In the midst of the pool, one can barely make out regions of darker green that form a vaguely human face.","Nestled among the various elemental there lies a plane composed entirely of acid. It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by mto be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elemental-based planes. Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable. They have no trouble moving on land, but prefer the sanctity of their native plane to all others. At rest, an acid quasi-elemental is a clear puddle of liquid with a slightly green hue. It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a waters elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that emits wisps of smoke. Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools when combating foes.

Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing through the endless skies. Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwaters, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwaters.

The elemental's home plane is a flat, rocky place with little life, no known waters sources, and no plant life or foliage. The plane is always shrouded in darkness. Dense pockets of intense gravity and areas of little or no gravity dot the barren landscape. Gravity elementals seem to be able to converse with others of their kind by manipulating gravity itself. Gravity elementals attack primarily by flailing at their opponents with multiple arms, each one a mixture of fluctuating fields of micro-gravity and debris that has been sucked into its gravity well. These creatures can also attack by adjusting the local gravity fields around themselves. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",12800

Elder Thing,5,aberration,any,This strange creature has a star-shaped head and numerous writhing appendages arranged radially around its barrel-shaped body.,"Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as ""elder things"" or ""old ones,"" these strange creatures have very little of the humanoid in their shape, yet their philosophies and goals shine with very human features-fundamental curiosities about the nature of life, deep interests and skills in creating lasting works of art and architecture, and a boundless capacity for war and egotism. An elder thing's body is the shape of an elongated barrel featuring ridges that run from one end to the other. The creature's head rests at one end-a starfish-shaped organ with eyes at the tips of the arms, stalked feeding tubes, and a mouthlike opening at the center. At the other end of its body coil five long tentacles and a wriggling mass of smaller tendrils-the creature's primary source of locomotion on land. Five sets of wings can extend from its body, along with five sets of branchlike arms ending in numerous small feelers that work akin to a human's fingers and hands; both sets of limbs can be retracted into the body as needed. A typical elder thing is 6 feet from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy for their size, an elder thing generally weighs about 450 pounds. Ecology Elder things are most at home in waters, yet comfortable on land as well. While quite heavy, they are capable of flight, although this method of transportation is one without grace for an elder thing. Even the depths of outer space hold little danger for these creatures, and there are few places in the universe that are barred from their exploration. An elder thing's blood is thick and syrupy, with a nauseating green tinge and an even more nauseating odor. Manimals, dogs in particular, find this scent unpleasant or downright frightening, driven to extremes of fear or violence if confronted with it. The creature possesses both lungs and gills, but its physiology is also capable of shutting itself down completely in times of need, allowing it to enter a state of profound hibernation during the course of a long journey or when faced with no other recourse than to retreat into a well-defended bunker or vault to outwait danger. Highly intelligent, the elder things are no stranger to magic or technology. While their bodies are decidedly inhuman, they possess analogous limbs that function well enough for them to utilize weapons or magical items similarly to most humanoids. Obvious exceptions such as armor, helms, boots, and gloves are unusable by elder things unless they are crafted in such a way as to fit their unusual bodies, but their limbs can easily accommodate things like rings, amulets, bracers, belts, and even cloaks. Most elder things eschew melee weapons, opting instead for their natural weapons, magic, or strange technological items for combat, but they are capable of wielding weapon a human could in their strong, agile tentacles. Habitat & Society The elder things are travelers-with the ability to navigate interstellar distances, their kind has journeyed to and settled upon countless planets throughout the universe. The time required to make such journeys is significant, so once a colony arrives on a planet, they generally remain for eons, only sending new colonists out into the darkness when the urge or need to find a new home grows too strong. In some cases, elder things who dwell too long upon a planet lose the ability to survive in outer space, effectively stranding that colony for the rest of time. Elder things have their own language-a strangesounding ""tongue"" consisting of haunting piping sounds and shrill cries that are difficult for humans to mimic. The written version of this language incorporates a radial pattern of markings-to the untrained eye, elder thing writing looks like a random sequence of dots in strange circular patterns. The elder things prefer to colonize planets devoid of sentient life, for among their great sciences is the art of creating new organisms. The elder things often engage in war against other societies for dominance of such ripe planets-their histories are filled with accounts of such wars against mi-go, star-spawn of Cthulhu, or as in the case of the world of Golarion, the aboleths. In this instance, the aboleths won the war, yet not so decisively so as to prevent small colonies of elder things from establishing footholds here and there in remote corners of the world. Elder things are cited in mblasphemous texts as the creators of the dreaded shoggoth-a creature bred for its versatility and strength and used to erect vast cities for the elder things to dwell in. Yet the race's egotism often exceeds its discretion, as in the case of the shoggoth. Uprisings of shoggoth slaves who develop intelligence over the course of several generations have spelled the doom for countless elder thing colonies, yet most elder things consider such events to be the failures of ""lesser minds,"" thinking themselves above the level of making such mistakes. On other worlds, the elder things are said to have created even wider varieties of life, and it may be that the elder things are the true source of entire alien ecosystems.",1600

Its body is grayish-brown and lightens near the head. Small yellow splotches can be seen near the mouth. The electric eel is slimy to the touch and has no scales . An electric eel prefers to discharge its electricity when it first enters combat. Those slain or rendered unconscious by the shock are devoured. Should opponents survive the attack, the eel either flees  or attacks its remaining foes with its bite. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",600
Elemental Air Dragon,18,outsider,Plane of Air,This massive creature resembles a huge dragon composed of air and vapor. Its great wings are translucent and look like wisps of smoke. Its eyes are hollow sockets of mist though a glint of bright sunlight can occasionally be seen dancing across the surface. Its great tail appears as wisps of smoke or vapor and seems to trail off into nothingness.,"The Plane of Air is home to mcreatures. Yet none are as feared as the elemental air dragons. Their great form and majestic aura strike fear into the bravest of souls. Elemental air dragons are as evil as their brethren  and take joy and pride in swooping over a settlement or village and destroying it with their great wing buffet. Watching the frightened creatures flee in terror provokes some sort of perverse excitement in these dragons. Luckily, elemental air dragons rarely enter the Material Plane. Elemental air dragons dislike cloud dragons and mist dragons and seek to slay them whenever they are encountered. The average air elemental dragon is 30 feet long. Elemental air dragons attack by swooping on their prey, unleashing a blast of superheated air, and then flying away. An elemental air dragon rarely, if ever, touches the ground. It often employs its cyclone buffet to knock more powerful creatures prone, then swoops in to blast them with its breath weapon or rend them with its claws and bite.

Elemental Earth Dragon,20,outsider,Plane of Earth,This creature resembles a 30-foot long dragon composed of stone and earth. Its great wings glisten like polished stone. Its eyes are deep gray and its roar seems to shake the very earth itself.,"Elemental earth dragons are the strongest of the elemental dragons. Using their great stone tail or earthen claws, they can destroy almost anything in short order. The majority of their time is spent burrowing through the Plane of Earth devouring gems, minerals, and silicate life forms. On occasion, they are summoned to the Material Plane by evil  spellcasters who usually live just long enough to regret their mistake. Elemental earth dragons are evil  and despise most other forms of life. They rarely associate with other creatures, though a few have been known to have dealings with the occasional earth elemental. Elemental earth dragons cannot enter waters; they must burrow under it or walk around it. The average elemental earth dragon is 30 feet long. Its roar can be heard up to 5 miles away. Elemental earth dragons prefer to attack from ambush and secret rather than using a direct frontal assault. An elemental earth dragon lies in wait using its freeze ability or meld into stone ability and springs to attack when its prey comes into range. They are also fond of burrowing into the ground and surfacing under their prey, thereby gaining total surprise. Slain opponents are processed and absorbed into the body of the elemental earth dragon.

Elemental Fire Dragon,22,outsider,Plane of Fire,"This creature appears as a 30-foot long dragon composed of fire. Its eyes burn with a white-hot flame and flames lick the dragon's great mouth as it roars. As it flies overhead, its wings send sheets of flame roaring into the skies and crashing into the ground.","One of the most feared creatures from the Plane of Fire is the dreaded elemental fire dragon. They make their homes in the heart of the mvolcanoes that dot the elemental landscape. Composed entirely of flames, these magnificent creatures fear little and are respected and feared by those that have encountered them. Elemental fire dragons are malign, vicious, and thoroughly evil. They delight in killing and torturing others, especially magmin . They often employ salamanders to aid them in their adventures, but once they have accomplished their goals, surviving salamanders are usually devoured. Elemental fire dragons cannot enter waters or other nonflammable liquid, but they can fly or step over it. The typical elemental fire dragon is at least 30 feet long. Elemental fire dragons are ruthless adversaries. They care nothing for treasure or anything of value. An elemental fire dragon attempts to annihilate its opponents using means possible.

Elemental waters Dragon,18,outsider,Plane of waters,This creature resembles a massive dragon composed entirely of waters. Its wings slosh and drip waters as it moves them. Its great mouth opens into a maw of inky darkness. waters drips from its fangs.,"From the Plane of waters comes the elemental waters dragon . They make their homes in the deep oceans of the Material Plane and are rarely found far away from large expanses of waters. An elemental waters dragon is composed entirely of waters and commands respect from the more intelligent sea creatures as well as those humanoids that ply their trade upon the waters. Elemental waters dragons are evil and take great pleasure in demanding sacrifice from those that dare enter their realm. If the sacrifice placates the dragon, it lets the creature pass unabated; otherwise, it attacks with all of its might and most often destroys those that offend it or fail to appease its desires. waters dragons take great pleasure in capsizing and sinking ships. Particularly evil waters dragons may accept a sacrifice and then sink the ship of those that crossed its path anyway. On occasion, a group of skum or other evil waters creatures can be found allied with an elemental waters dragon, but this alliance is usually short-lived and often shaky. It generally ends with the elemental waters dragon feeding on its former allies. Elemental waters dragons prefer to fight in or near waters where they can use their transparency and waters mastery abilities to full advantage. They prefer to attack from ambush, often lying in wait for their opponents and then springing from the waves to assault their foes. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",153600

Elk,1,animal,cold or temperate plains,"This majestic beast stands the height of a man at its shoulders, a many-tipped rack of proud antlers crowning its head.","Elk range in great herds throughout the plains, hills, and forests of mwilderness areas. Their size, strength, and antlers allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionally adaptable survivors, capable of living through severe weather changes without concern. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females far slighter than the males. Numerous species of elk exist. Some larger species can stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and can be used as mounts by Medium humanoids; these elk have 3 Hit Dice and are Large.

Elusa Hound,3,magical beast,temperate forests or plains,"This powerful wolf-like dog has coarse white fur and pale white skin, and a short, bushy tail. Its eyes are a sickly yellow in color and its teeth are bone white.","Elusa hounds are used by different creatures for different reasons; though ultimately there have but one purpose: tracking  magic-wielders. These creatures can detect the emanations given off by arcane and divine spellcasters and use this scent to track them. The origins of the elusa hounds have mystified even the most learned of sages, for though they seem to be born of magic, no spellcaster in his or her right mind would ever create such a beast. Renegade bands enthralled with the idea of ridding the world of spellcasters sometimes employ them. Civilized towns and cities likewise use them in places where magic is forbidden or policed by the local government. In other instances, they are used by spellcasters to ferret out rivals. When given instructions to track and kill their target, a pack of elusa hounds uses tactics similar to other canine animals: circle the prey and attack simultaneously from the front, rear, and flanks. These beasts can easily be trained to pin or hold a foe rather than kill it. This tactic is often employed by military or government units when they wish to capture and interrogate a renegade spellcaster. When using these tactics, the elusa hound attempts to trip its foe and then pins it with a bite. Elusa hounds radiate a moderate aura of divination magic if examined with detect magic or the like.

Elysian Titan,21,outsider,land,This titanic humanoid wears gilt-edged armor of ancient make and carries an immense hammer made of gleaming metal.,"A race that was old when the world was young, titans are very near to the divine. This nearness inspired bitterness in the hearts of the mightiest titans, and when they grew jealous of the adulation the gods received from mortals, they began a crusade to destroy mortal life. As this war began, the Elysian titans turned against their kin and, by sacrificing some of their power to the gods, convinced the deities to banish their arrogant kin to the Abyss. Lone Elysian titans often wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others still have the crusading impulse of the ancient war and can be found manipulating events from behind the scenes, training aspiring heroes, counseling kings, marshesaling armies to overthrow tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends. A titan does not age-unless slain by violence, a titan is immortal. One in every dozen Elysian titans is a prophet-a titan who manifests the goodwill of the gods and possesses the spellcasting power of a 20th-level cleric.

The snake's scales are generally a dark green, with a pale green or even ivory underbelly. Its eyes are bright red and lack the distinctive serpentine slit most snake eyes possess. Emperor cobras are often trained to serve as guardians in temples. They are 16 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.",1600
Emperor of Scales,15,outsider,any,"The air fills with the sound of hissing snakes as a giant, severed snake's head floats into view, with a gaping mouth and twin fangs dripping virulent poison. Its eyes are milky and blind, but its forked tongue constantly tests the air for fresh scents. Below the head, where a body should be, numerous hissing serpents thrash like tendrils of torn flesh. Blood drips from the severed head, sizzling as it burns like acid through anything it touches.","In the earliest days of the Age of Serpents, when the great serpentfolk empire was young, the serpentfolk were ruled by a single, powerful priest-king. When Ydersius took his rightful place as god of the serpentfolk, he exalted this priest-king above all others, raising the king up to become his foremost servant and herald. With his original name long lost to memory, the first king of the serpentfolk empire became known as the Emperor of Scales. With Ydersius's still-living head entombed beneath the earth and his mindless body endlessly wandering the Darklands, the Emperor of Scales is the snake-god's primary representative on Golarion. Unable to take direct action on his own, Ydersius relies upon his herald to enact his will on the Material Plane. The Emperor of Scales embodies the fall of the mighty serpentfolk empire from its previous heights, and personifies the rage of Ydersius himself, trapped and sundered into two lesser parts. But he also represents the god's immortality, for even in defeat Ydersius was not slain, and even without a body, the Emperor of Scales still serves. The Emperor of Scales does not speak, but it can communicate telepathically. Snakes and serpents of all kinds and sizes flock to the Emperor of Scales, who can enslave them to his will. The Emperor of Scales appears as a giant snake's head about 20 feet long, and weighs close to 5 tons. His serpentine tendrils extend another 15 feet behind and around his head. Ecology When Ydersius was whole and walked Golarion as the god of the serpentfolk empire, the Emperor of Scales appeared as a giant serpentfolk warrior clad in golden scale armor who strode across ancient battlefields wielding spells and blade with equal precision. When Ydersius was beheaded by the Azlanti heroine Savith and cast down, the Emperor of Scales suffered his own mutilation. In a sympathetic ref lection of his master's fate, the Emperor's head tore itself free from his body, growing to monstrous size while his humanoid body quickly withered away. His eyes clouded over, blinding the herald, but the tendrils of flesh that once attached his head to his body transformed into a multitude of hissing, poisonous vipers. The Emperor of Scales has kept that form since, but the faithful of Ydersius believe that when the snake-god is restored, so too will his herald return to his original form and once more lead the serpentfolk armies to victory. Originally born on Golarion, the Emperor of Scales is a native outsider. He sleeps like normal creature, and when not called upon to serve, spends most of his time in a dream-filled torpor, much like the severed head of Ydersius himself. Unlike other native outsiders, however, the Emperor of Scales does not need to eat. As he no longer has a body to process and digest food, he gains sustenance from his divine link with Ydersius. On other planes, the Emperor of Scales gains the extraplanar subtype, and requires neither food nor sleep. Habitat & Society At the height of Ydersius's power, the Emperor of Scales divided his time between Golarion and Ydersius's planar realm, the pocket plane of Sydrixus deep in the unending chaos of the Maelstrom. Since Ydersius's defeat, that realm has been closed to both the god and his servants, and like Ydersius, the Emperor of Scales has been confined to the Material Plane. In the millennia since, the Emperor of Scales has traveled throughout the Material Plane, alternately searching the Darklands of Golarion for the sundered skull and body of Ydersius, or sleeping for centuries, dreaming of his master's restoration and return. The Emperor of Scales has been encountered numerous times over the ages in various abandoned cities of the ancient serpentfolk, both on Golarion, and some say, on other worlds as well. Powerful priests of Ydersius have been known to wake the Emperor of Scales when they find him and request his aid. Such alliances are usually short-lived, however, as the herald inevitably moves on in search of his lost master. The Emperor of Scales is known to work with demons on occasion, though those fiends serving Abraxas are viewed as enemies, and the herald does not hesitate to attack and destroy them, returning them to their Abyssal realm. In his original form, the Emperor of Scales frequently mated with mortal serpentfolk and left behind countless semidivine progeny. What happened to these paragons of the serpentfolk race after the fall of the serpentfolk empire is unknown, although mpowerful serpentfolk priests claim descent from the herald to bolster their own inf luence. These days, exceptionally large or particularly strong snakes are said to be the brood of the Emperor of Scales, remnants of his serpentine tendrils that were severed in battle and took on a life of their own. Whether or not these claims are true is of little importance-certainly the Emperor of Scales himself seems unconcerned with such potential offspring.",51200
Empyreal,15,outsider,good-aligned plane,This creature resembles a man-sized column of white fire. Within the burning fires seems to be a winged humanoid-shaped creature dressed in shining armor.,"Empyreals are knights and warriors in the service of good deities. While closely associated with other angels, empyreals are often found leading holy armies against the forces of evil. They are fiery, quick-tempered, and forceful, but always fair. In the upper planes those that serve as commanders spend their time organizing their troops and planning strategies. While the more powerful empyreals serve as commanders, the lesser can be found performing number of duties, whether it is acting as guard, servant, or messenger. Empyreals that enter combat prefer to attack their opponents with a mixture of magic and direct physical attacks with their longswords. Against powerful foes, an empyreal uses its radiant blast to catch as mfoes as it can in the area of effect.

Encephalon Gorger,8,aberration,land,"This creature is a sleek, pale-skinned humanoid with leathery white, semi-translucent flesh. It is a bit taller than an average human. Its features are delicate and precise. The creature's arms and legs are spindly, and each ends in four digits. This creature is completely hairless and its eyes are small, with nictitating membranes.","Encephalon gorgers  are malevolent creatures from another dimension or plane of existence. They are greatly feared by intelligent creatures for they use such beings  to power their great cities. Mof these creatures have constructed strongholds or outposts on the Material Plane, though it is unknown when they first appeared. Encephalon gorgers dislike for direct sunlight, though they are not harmed by it. When traveling aboveground in daylight hours, they usually cloak themselves in robes of gray or black. The gorger's leathery, whitish flesh is nearly translucent and in older encephalon gorgers one can faintly see veins and other organs pushing grayish-brown blood through its body. This creature is completely hairless and its eyes are small with nictitating membranes. Its mouth is lined with short, needlelike teeth, with the canines being most pronounced . Encephalon gorgers enter battle using their claws to slash and grapple their foes, going first for targets with the most delicious, intelligent brains. Once it grabs its prey it sinks its teeth into the foe's head, draining it of cerebral fluid. However, an encephalon gorger will not put itself in danger by ignoring other threats around it, so generally it only drinks when all of its other foes are either dead or engaged with others of its kind. Encephalon gorgers often make use of slave creatures and dumb beasts to engage an enemy's warriors while it sidles behind its chosen victim. Often times, an encephalon gorger attempts to capture rather than kill its prey, especially in the case of intelligent humanoids. Captured prey is taken to one of their alien cities, where it is handed over to the Breeders who tend the slave pits. Encephalon gorgers advance by character level; mhave levels in wizard or psionic-oriented classes. At least one such gorger capable of interplanar travel is always present in Prime Material Plane outpost. Encephalon Gorger Society Encephalon gorgers refer to themselves as Silians and they make their homes deep beneath the surface world or hidden far away from prying eyes . Underground lairs resemble great domed cities, while those on the surface resemble iron fortresses of exquisite craftsmanship. Each lair, regardless of its location, has dozens of slave pits and breeding pens filled with captured, intelligent humanoids . The slaves are maintained by a specialized group of silians called the Breeders. It is their job to tend to food supply of the city at all times and to gauge the relative worth of each and every humanoid used by the gorgers for feeding. Encephalon gorgers sometimes trade with other races, usually trading for slaves, which are taken to the Breeders. Other slaves are kept by particular encephalon gorgers and assigned menial tasks. Once such a slave has exhausted its usefulness, it is ""recycled"" in the food pens so long as it isn't dead. Dead slaves are discarded, ground up into a bland paste that is fed to the other slaves. Little is known of particulars regarding the gorger's society; such as reproduction, lifespan, aging patterns and so on. A few things that are known come from a group of adventurers that saw one of the iron fortresses and lived to tell about it. They spoke of large vats filled with cranial fluid maintained by the Breeders and of young silian being grown in these vats. They also spoke of the horrid squalor of the breeding pits and the slaves kept in them. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
End's Voice,15,outsider,any,"A long crimson cloak drapes over the form of this large faceless being, which floats just above the ground on footless legs as its menacing flail crackles with blue currents of electricity.","Groetus's herald is End's Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected. The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus. Ecology End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountains, slowly scouring away at existence like the oceans's tide or a deserts wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations. Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a diff icult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again. When called by mortals, the herald demands specif ic deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions. HABITAT & SOCIETY When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a specif ic task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts their presence  as if used to them. On one occasion, it absorbed a servitor into itself, inhaling the creature like smoke, then expelling it a year later with no explanation or apparent harm to the creature.",51200
Entropic Ooze,9,ooze,Negative Energy Plane,"This protoplasmic creature resembles a giant amoeba, black in color. A deathly cold seems to emanate from its form.","An entropic ooze is a dangerous and deadly protoplasmic creature thought to have arrived on the Material Plane from another dimension or time. Its sole purpose seems to be the collection and destruction of the souls of the living. Some tales spoken only in whispers say the entropic ooze is the creation of an insane god, sent to destroy life so that the gods may remake creation. Others conjecture that the entropic ooze is the creation of some vile and evil spellcaster warped on the perverseness of its own destruction and that of the world around it. Whatever its true purpose, the entropic ooze is a deadly creature that seems to have no useful purpose in the ecosystem, save perhaps to those of a destructive nature. Entropic oozes can be found just about anywhere, though most are found in or near locations frequented by living creatures. They prefer areas of darkness, such as subterranean caves, dungeons, and the like, where their naturally dark coloration allows them to blend into the natural darkness. An entropic ooze is an amorphous and swirling mass of black protoplasm that covers an area of 10 feet or more. Its form resembles that of a black pudding and it is often mistaken for said creature. The entropic ooze is naturally cold to the touch and those that have contacted the ooze , speak of the unnatural energy they felt flowing through it. The screams of those that have been absorbed are thought to be heard emanating from the creature's form as it undulates along. A entropic ooze is driven by its hunger and need to absorb souls. It attacks by forming pseudopods from its protoplasmic form or by simply rolling over its opponents and absorbing them into its form. After devouring the soul of an engulfed creature, the entropic ooze ejects the creature's physical body, now a dried and crumbling husk. An entropic ooze prefers to absorb as mcreatures as it can into its body, and then pummel those that avoid being engulfed with its powerful pseudopods. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
Ephialtes Kyton,16,outsider,any,"Amid a roiling cloud of deepest dark, the rattle of chains and heavy footfalls announce a being of immense size. An infernal, gasping hiss draws the darkness back, revealing a tortured, fourlegged fiend of exposed bone and ragged flesh draped in chains. Barbs and hooks hang from these wrought iron bands, matching the fiend's tail as they writhe like snakes in search of prey.","Sadistic hunters and tormentors of all living souls, ephialtes kytons usually roam the planes in service to the lords of Hell and Shadow, but occasionally in pursuit of their own fell interests. They ruthlessly abduct the innocent and retrieve the damned, dragging their victims into the fires of Hell or the gnashing, wailing dark of the Plane of Shadow. They have no fear, tracking their chosen prey regardless of distance or challenge, and shackle dragons, giants, and humanoids alike for their eternal torturous rewards. Ephialtes kytons travel in silent grace while cloaked in darkness, but drop their stealthy veils when ready to intimidate those they've come to collect or punish. Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes' ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond. A typical ephialtes stands 25 feet tall and weighs over 15 tons with the combined burden of their deadly chains. Ecology An ephialtes kyton results from the ritual transformation of a lesser kyton which has slain or bound 999 mortal victims in the soulless dark of the Shadow Plane. Thereafter, it gains the ability to shadow walk and expand its access to other planes without waiting for summoners to request its services. Eternally vigilant and opportunistic, ephialtes kytons hunt for further victims for young kytons to practice upon. Because of their honed expertise in capturing and tormenting souls, ephialtes are highly useful to the diabolical elite-both mortals and the immortal lords of Hell-who seek out ephialtes kytons as fell servants. Some kytons willingly align themselves with the rulers of Hell, taking further delight in the various torments available in that realm. Habitat & Society Ephialtes kytons shepherd and rule over the entirety of kyton society. Though not especially cunning compared to other fiends, they still possess a fierce loyalty to their own kind and adhere to a rigid hierarchy of power and achievement. Their homes within the Plane of Shadow remain eternally hidden, with the sounds of flesh-flensing chains providing the only insight into their torturous methods. Few outsiders understand the purpose of these elaborate torments, though rumors suggest they further empower the ephialtes to ever-greater transformations. Summoning Ephialtes Kytons As long as a conjurer doesn't interrupt an ongoing hunt, most ephialtes kytons relish being summoned, looking forward to the sport of chasing down newly assigned prey or punishing those who fail to properly bind them. Any Charisma check made as part of the greater planar binding spell to convince an ephialtes kyton to undertake a mission other than the murder, abduction, or torture of specific victims suffers a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton accepts an assignment, it demands 1,000 gp paid in black onyx or opals for every Hit Die its target possesses. If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time , or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charismarelated interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty. Once an ephialtes kyton has agreed to a task, only its assigned prey interests it. Ephialtes kytons always offer to dispose of such victims by taking them to the Shadow Plane so they can help lesser kytons obtain the necessary number of souls to become ephialtes.",51200
Eremite,20,outsider,any,This blood-soaked humanoid is festooned with razored shards of metal. Skeletal wings protrude from its bleeding shoulders.,"Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated of kytons, having inflicted such massive damage to themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments are all that holds the creature's mutilated flesh together, yet they do so with a strength far greater than that granted by mortal flesh and bone. Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire only the most powerful beings to augment themselves with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane in search of the most promising additions to their bodily collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that possess a so-called ""perfect part,"" the powerful kyton seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite, these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they merely enhance the horror that the creature represents. While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection of their targets as well as introspection regarding their own powers and identity, their primary occupation is the understanding of pain and suffering, which they pursue by inflicting the most heinous cruelties upon their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own flesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to experience the pain alongside it. While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist in harvesting an even more interesting catch, an eremite can sometimes be convinced to let the helpful victim escape. It's worth remembering, though, that kytons as a whole have little patience for the petty pursuits of honor and pride, seeing such feelings as traits that ultimately spell the end for baser creatures. The only thing that matters to an eremite is the testing of its boundaries as well as the boundaries of existence itself. Just because an eremite might be convinced to let someone go in trade for an opportunity for a greater catch doesn't mean that once that other target is secured the eremite will cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original target. One who manages to distract and subsequently escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his life on the run. A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft particularly unusual pieces of flesh to their bodies from increasingly exotic victims. EREMITE OVERLORDS Eremites who surpass the limits of individuality and achieve dominion over a certain realm of the Plane of Shadow are referred to as eremite overlords. An overlord has focused on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure. Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues. Each overlord is a unique Large  eremite with several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act of skinning itself and wrapping its flesh in thorny black vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns, and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.",307200
Erinyes Devil,8,outsider,any,Some calamity has befallen this angelic warrior. Wings stained black shear the air as her merciless eyes search for a target.,"Known by mnames-the Fallen, the Ash Wings, and the Furies-the devils called erinyes mock the form of the angelic hosts in their exaction of vengeance and bloody justice. Executioners, not judges, erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell's cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights. Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducers-they lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim's suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes's not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their torment-mgoing as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions. Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh approximately 140 pounds, even with their blackfeathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide.",3200
Erodaemon,11,outsider,any,"This fiend appears to be a slim half-elf with long hair and a slender set of black ram horns. Covered by a sheer gown, her skin is tinged blue and covered with an elaborate tracery of white, scarified tattoos. A long, serpentine tail sprouts from the base of her spine, ending in a fanged maw. Her extremities are withered and blackened, ending in scorched, fleshless talons, and her unearthly beauty is further marred by a red, unblinking third eye.","Erodaemons personify death by heartbreak. These fiends pose as mortals, insert themselves into the lives of their victims, and slowly destroy them. They break apart marriages, kill children or cause them to leave their families, destroy reputations, extinguish faith, curdle family ties, and bit by bit savor the slow disintegration of their victims' emotional well-being and consequent physical deterioration. Every tear shed, every sobbing woman, and every grieving man brings a rapturous smile to an erodaemon's face, because when a mortal dies of heartbreak and grief, the erodaemon feasts upon the tortured soul. The typical erodaemon stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ecology Erodaemons sometimes form from the hunted, the wandering mortal souls of Abaddon. Corrupted by their heartbreak, the resulting erodaemons seek to impose their morbid fate upon others. Erodaemons are thought by some to be Abaddon's answer to the demonic succubi and diabolic erinyes, possessing the visage of beautiful mortals, yet tainted with obviously fiendish traits and intentions. However, rather than inspiring wars based on lust or torturing victims ceaselessly, erodaemons seek to stoke the flames of mortal woe, causing mto fall into such pits of melancholy that they ultimately perish. When a mortal succumbs to death as a way to escape the pain of living without one's love, an erodaemon ensnares the soul and feasts upon its anguish. Though they can appear as either a man or woman to their victims, in their true form, erodaemons are predominantly female. Erodaemons freely adopt whatever guises they deem necessary to infiltrate and ravage the lives of the mortals they hunt throughout the planes, and when not donning mortal figures, they often shift between various forms as they so desire, honing their ability to adopt each particular gender's behavioral quirks for when it matters. Habitat & Society Erodaemons know mtraditions of different societies due to their intrusions into urban areas on other planes. In Abaddon, however, such communal grounds are rare, if they exist at all. In the sprawling wastes, erodaemons practice their forms of seduction primarily upon the hunted, who may still have such base desires as intimacy and love. Erodaemons are rarely trusted by other daemons, who have no hearts to break but can be tricked all the same into thinking a supposed ally or leader has turned its back on them. While infiltrating other planes, erodaemons prefer to hunt alone most of the time. Selecting a particularly susceptible victim-such as one whose heart already throbs for another-an erodaemon will assume the guise of its target's lover and make the victim believe his or her partner is unfaithful, abusive, or worse. The devastation this causes for both of the real members of the relationship is delectable to the erodaemon, whose kiss snatches life that still remains in the souls of those whose hearts it breaks. Similarly, an erodaemon might simply assume the form of a beautiful suitor, bewitching an already devoted mortal into relations which will ultimately be discovered suddenly by his or her mate. When the affair is revealed- often in the bedroom-the erodaemon assumes its true form to devour the emotionally shattered remains of both parties involved. Erodaemons occasionally work together, but only if doing so results in a greater harvest of crushed mortal souls. This usually involves mesmerizing entire groups of people, often at a risqué performance or event, and seductively sapping the life from the unwitting spectators. While such ruses are elaborate enough to pique erodaemons' peculiar tastes, the act of tricking mortals on an individual level often yields much more broken-and thus all the more delicious-souls. Given their diverse uses and unique insights into mortals, erodaemons serve all of the Four equally. In addition to typical erodaemon servitors, erodaemons with particularly specialized skill sets serve each Horseman as his or her needs require. Apollyon possesses access to a group of plagued erodaemons who act as jubilant and seductive carriers of venereal diseases; Trelmarixian's erodaemons target rulers of kingdoms in order to divert resources meant for food; Szuriel's erodaemons woo entire legions of soldiers into embittered deaths; and Charon's erodaemons seek and further destroy the hearts of the aged.",12800

Ettercap,3,aberration,temperate forests,"This hideous purple creature walks upright like a man, but its face is that of a spider, and its hands are sickle-shaped claws.","Ettercaps are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 200 pounds. They are solitary creatures and rarely group with others of their kind, even to mate. When they do group, they tend to attract a variety of different spiders, forming a strange collective of ettercaps and arachnids. Ettercaps are known for building cunning traps out of webs and other natural materials, using them to trap prey. They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the trees away from other ground-based predators, and use monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians. Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its claws and venomous bite. It usually refuses to come within melee reach of foe that is still able to move, and flees if an opponent gets free.",800
Ettin,6,humanoid,cold hills,"This lumbering, filthy, two-headed giant wears tattered remnants of leather armor and clutches a large flail in each fist.","Ettins superficially resemble hills or stone giants, although their tusked facial features betray orc blood in their lineage. They have pinkish-brown skin, but ettins never bathe if they can help it, which usually leaves them so grimy and dirty their skin resembles thick, gray hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years. Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Giant, Goblin, and Orc. Creatures that can speak of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit of information: if the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all three, the DC is 5. Though ettins aren't very intelligent, they are cunning fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin fights furiously until all enemies are dead. Ettins lead solitary lives, establishing lairs in secluded rocky caves and hollows, often surrounded by pits and trenches. Ettins sometimes keep cave bears as pets and guardians for their lairs. A particularly powerful ettin may attract a gang of a few followers, possibly with several goblin or orc allies. Such gatherings are the exception rather than the rule, however, and seldom last long, with individual ettins going their separate ways when opportunities for pillage and plunder decrease or if the leader is killed. Mated couples usually come together to breed for only a short time before going off on their own again. Young ettins mature quickly, reaching adult size within a year, when they are kicked out to fend for themselves.",2400
Euryale,22,outsider,Outer Planes,"This hideous creature appears to be almost twice as tall as a normal human. Its upper torso is that of a well proportioned human female with scaly flesh while its lower torso is that of a great black-scaled snake. Small black wings protrude from its back. Instead of hair, its head is covered with writhing, deadly asps. Its mouth is filled with razor-sharpened fangs.","Though the word gorgon is often associated with the deadly bull-like creature that turns a victim to stone with its breath weapon, the true gorgons are three sisters; Euryale, Sthenno, and Medusa. They are the daughters of the god Phorcys and the goddess Ceto. Euryale and Sthenno were born immortal and are hideous creatures with writing snakes for hair, brass claws, wings, and a gaze that can turn living creature into stone. Phorcys tasked them with guarding the entrance to the Underworld. Medusa was born mortal and was very beautiful. Phorcys sent her to the Material Plane so all could gaze upon the beauty of his daughter. Medusa's beauty rivaled that of some of the goddesses, and some of them grew jealous of Medusa, particularly the goddess Athena. Her beauty also turned the heads of some of the gods, and when Poseidon seduced her in a temple to Athena, the goddess became enraged and changed the beautiful Medusa into a creature as hideous as her sisters. Poseidon turned from his love, never to return again. Medusa, enraged, fled into the deserts and never came back to civilization. The hero Perseus was tasked with killing the gorgon known as Medusa and bringing her head to King Polydectes as a wedding present. Using a magic shield given to him by the gods, he avoided Medusa's deadly gaze and severed her head. From her serpentine body sprang the children of Poseidon, creatures similar in appearance to their mother. These creatures escaped into the world and are called medusa. Sthenno and Euryale long for their sister's return or their meeting with her in the Underworld. Yet being immortal, they cannot enter the Realm of the Dead. Thus, both know they will never see their beloved sibling again. Their cries are said to be audible on the wind as a high-pitched shrill akin to a bird's cry. Both Sthenno and Euryale are 10 feet tall and weigh around 600 pounds or more. Sthenno's eyes are blue; Euryale's eyes are copper. Sthenno and Euryale rarely enter combat unless pressed or provoked. They are both deadly combatants and use their claws, bite, snakes, and petrifying gaze with precision force. Sthenno enjoys ""collecting"" those she has turned to stone and even has a room in her lair where she displays them. Euryale simply smashes to rubble those she has petrified.

It has two eyeholes that can be used to see into or out of the monster . The executioner's hood is sometimes used to guard valuable belongings. It does so unerringly as long as a constant supply of food is available. The executioner's hood clings to the ceiling, waiting for prey to pass under it.

Eye Killer,4,magical beast,underground,"This man-sized creature looks like a cross between a bat and a snake. Its upper torso resembles that of a large black bat while its lower torso appears to be that of a green and yellow scaled snake. Dark green fur covers its upper body. Its eyes are large, lidless white circles and are without pupils.","Eye killers are subterranean dwellers that hate daylight. They dwell underground in dark places, where very little light can touch their sensitive eyes. They are evil, malicious creatures that delight in killing others, particularly those that wander to close to their lair. Eye killers seem to communicate with each other through a series of low rumbles and growls. They do not speak known language. Eye killers are limbless spherical things at birth, but take form as they develop, reaching maturity within a year. The average adult eye killer reaches a length of 7 feet. Its bat-like wings are useless, as the eye killer cannot fly. The eye killer is very territorial and attacks living creature that enters an area currently under its watchful eye. If the intruders a wield light source , the eye killer attacks using its eye ray ability by absorbing the light  into its eyes and releasing it in a bright flash of yellow light at its chosen target; otherwise, it dispatches the trespassers by grappling with its tail and squeezing. Eye killers flee if confronted with bright light, but otherwise are relentless in combat and always fight to the death.

Two large crab-like pincers protrude from its body, and two long, thin eyestalks sprout from the top of its orb.","Eyes of the deep are found only in the deepest parts of the oceans, though on occasion one moves too close to the shoreline and ends up beaching on the sands. An eye of the deep stranded in this manner dies in 2d4 minutes unless placed back into the waters. An eye of the deep floats slowly through the oceans searching for its prey.

Faceless Stalker,4,aberration,swamps or underground,"This hairless, leathery biped has a face dominated by grotesque and unsettling whorls and slits instead of actual features.","Ugothols  are one of the mtools created and then discarded by the aboleths in their long war against the surface dwellers. Scorned by their former masters when the scheme for which they were designed unraveled, the faceless stalkers fled into swamps, marshes, or other dark, wet places they could find-the closest they could come to the waters cities they once considered home. Originally designed to serve as spies that could walk uncontested among the air-breathing races, faceless stalkers adopt new forms by reshaping their skin and contorting their rubbery bodies. This painful process takes approximately 10 uninterrupted minutes-an ugothol typically seeks a private place to do it, avoiding even others of its own kind. The sensation of returning to its true form is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary burst of euphoria. Faceless stalkers cannot digest solid food even when in the form of a creature with a mouth. Instead, they subsist on liquids, including blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues which they use to penetrate and lap blood from their victims. Since they have no particular skill at grappling foes, most ugothols wait until a victim is helpless or asleep before attempting to drink its blood-although the best is when a victim is helpless but conscious during the process, so that the faceless stalker can ""play with its food"" by having grisly and cruel conversations with it.",1200
Faceless Whale,15,magical beast,waters,"A deep groan at the edge of hearing precedes the appearance of this sightless leviathan, whose pallid body breaks the surface of dark waters without as much as a ripple.","Called ""ansiktsloshvals"" in Aklo, and sometimes called ""Darklands whales,"" faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubber-lined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly. It is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song. An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large. Ecology Faceless whales resemble the toothed whales common to the Arcadian oceans in body structure, possessing a tapered mouth lined with stubby, conical teeth and a streamlined body. Lacking eyes, faceless whales depend totally upon their keen blindsight to navigate, seek prey, and avoid the predations of the Sightless Sea's most horrific inhabitants. Faceless whales prefer to hunt near the bottom of the Sightless Sea, where crushing pressures and freezing temperatures nurture large, sluggish organisms with few places to hide, and where the whales find safety from other menacing predators. Because of the unusual and outright alien composition of the creatures found within the lowest depths, faceless whales developed indiscriminate appetites. A hungry faceless whale consumes virtually living thing it can gulp into its jaws, including the plentiful waters aberrations. Faceless whales can remain submerged for hours at a time, diving to depths of over 7,000 feet. Faceless whales that survive to adulthood in the harsh conditions of Orv live 80 years or longer. As predators that spend the majority of their lives in the deepest waters, Darklands whales are rarely spotted. Those who sail upon the dark currents of the Sightless Sea and lakes Nirthran see these beasts only when the whales surface to breathe. When surfacing, a faceless whale breathes for minutes at a time, exhaling and inhaling massive volumes of air in great misty spouts. When a faceless whale finds prey it can easily outswim, it plunges downward with its mouth agape, snapping up the morsel before it can react. When pursuing larger or faster prey, the faceless whale becomes a persistence hunter, hounding its quarry at a deceptively leisurely pace. After what often proves to be days of dogged pursuit, the whale's prey becomes too exhausted to swim further. Before the quarry can marshesal the last of its strength to defend itself, the faceless whale renders it helpless with a resonant song. When the faceless whale is not in combat, it uses this sonic attack to break through rock and gain access to new hunting grounds within Orv and beyond. Habitat & Society Faceless whales typically hunt and swim alone, except when prey is abundant. When hunting is favorable, faceless whales organize into pods led by the oldest  female. Pods are short lived, often forming only a handful of times within a faceless whale's lifetime. As such, males compete fiercely for breeding rights during these gatherings. Pods last only as long as prey sustains them. Once food becomes scarce, the pod disperses into the Sightless Sea, and individual whales brave the chills waters alone in search of richer hunting grounds. Mated pairs of faceless whales remain together only long enough to raise their first calf. This period of nurturing typically lasts no longer than 5 years-just enough time for the parents to teach a calf basic hunting strategies and witness its first unassisted kill. Afterward, the parents part ways, leaving the calf to mature to adulthood or perish in the uncertain depths of the abyss. A faceless whale spends the majority of its life in isolation, plumbing the depths of the Sightless Sea in search of prey, the occasional mate, and hunting grounds rich enough to support a temporary pod. When it makes such a discovery, a faceless whale circles the boundary of the new territory, calling out to its fellows with a groaning, dirge-like song that carries for leagues. Whalers who ply their trade upon the Sightless Sea listen for this dirge with fanatical obsession. Faceless whales provide numerous alchemical ingredients, and their bones and teeth make excellent weapons and armor. An adult faceless whale possesses enough of both to make a crew of whalers rich, provided they have the courage and skill to slay the creature. Though faceless whales prefer larger meals, they eagerly prey upon humanoids when other food is scarce. A sailor fallen overboard makes an easy snack for an adult or a full meal for a juvenile. Conventional wisdom claims that faceless whales consider seagoing vessels indigestible, but serpentfolk hiss tales of faceless whales of exceptional cunning that capsize or fracture ships and feast upon the drowning crews, plucking them from among the flotsam. On rare occasion, a faceless whale finds its way into the oceans of Golarion. Some believe the creatures possess an instinctive knowledge of hidden watersways linking the Sightless Sea to the world above . Those few faceless whales that venture beyond the Darklands typically do so only brief ly, breaching the surface on moonless nights just long enough to take in a breath of air free from the fetid staleness of Orv. Msages postulate that the Sightless Sea is bottomless, its deepest trenches connecting to planes of primordial darkness where the pressure is capable of crushing living beings into stone. It is possible that the Sightless Sea is just one of mfaceless whale hunting grounds. If this is the case, there is no telling what a faceless whale might bring up from the ebon depths.",51200
Fachen,5,aberration,temperate hills or plains,"This half-bodied monstrosity with an overly wide mouth and stringy hair hops about on a single leg, balancing in defiance of its awkward physical form. A single arm-centered on the creature's torso and formed of tightly corded muscle-and single eye round out the being's features.","The fearsome fachen's terrifying visage stops the hearts of all but the most intrepid. Reports disagree on just what it is about the fachen that turns one's blood to ice-the single leg and foot that somehow don't affect the being's balance or speed, the seemingly too-strong arm jutting out from the center of the creature's torso, or the lone bulbous eye leering maliciously at its would-be prey. Though the fachen's grotesque approximation of a humanoid form could be enough to scare a traveler witless on its own, no single part of the abomination's appearance induces fear like that of its mouth, which spans the creature's face and is filled with a full row of long, sharp teeth. A typical fachen stands just short of 6 feet tall, and despite appearing to be half a person, weighs around 150 pounds because of its muscle mass. While it is not a very large creature, its fearsome composition increases its perceived presence. Ecology It is unknown how the first  fachens were produced. The studies performed on the few viable specimens successfully collected showed no anatomical means of reproduction, leading to a theory of otherworldly intervention. Fachens are carnivorous beings, and greatly prefer fresh humanoid meat over other, often more readily available fauna. Fachens will pass by a family of deer or a pasture full of cattle to sniff out and hunt a single humanoid. Fachens are not content with simply killing and eating their meal; they like to mutilate their prey as they ingest it, particularly if their food still holds on to the final traces of life and consciousness as the fachens' teeth pierce its flesh. Fachens' tendency to mutilate their victims and feed off the creatures' fear help to sate the rage simmering just beneath their surfaces-but only temporarily. Food alone will never sate this hatred. The source of the fachens' anger and hatred is unknown, perhaps even to them. Whether their eating habits actually alleviate the seething rage or merely cover it up, the fachens care not. Though not very intelligent, a fachen is relatively skilled when it comes to tracking prey, especially if it failed to catch a meal using ambush and scare tactics. Rage and hunger focus a fachen so intensely that it relentlessly tracks down being that manages to get past it. Despite a physiology that should lead to problems balancing and getting around, fachens are accustomed to their weight distribution and single-appendage movement. They also have an instinctual ability to defend themselves by dodging. A fachen springs off with its single leg and foot at a high enough speed to keep pace with most bipedal creatures, and has an uncanny ability to jump. Fachens' movements add to the overall fear the creature exudes. Their strange but dexterous locomotion and the single-armed striking of their attacks frighten and bewilder those who engage the creatures. A fachen is not particularly careful or perceptive in the midst of a meal. Unless battling multiple targets from the outset, once a fachen takes down its prey, it focuses solely on that meal until it's had its fill of food and fun. A fachen takes its meal right where its prey drops, be it along some goat trail through the hills or in the middle of a high-traffic road. It takes no pains to hide the corpse of its kill after feeding, nor does it strip the body of valuables. It's content to leave the body in its final resting place and go off in search of waters, more food, or a place to rest until its hunger and anger stir again. Habitat & Society Fachens are solitary by nature; they hold no fraternal love for their ilk, and are just as likely to view them as prey as they would other creature. They possess no special defense against the fearsome appearance of others of their kind, and this knowledge keeps them apart as well. Unfortunately, only a few warning signs alert one fachen that another is in close proximity. A mutilated corpse on or near a path serves as a warning between the monstrous beings, which are able to identify another fachen's handiwork with just a glance. A felled orchard can also signify a fachen's presence, if the remaining boles show signs of damage from the axes fachens prefer to wield. Fachens are most often found in areas of temperate climate, typically in hills or plains. They have no particular love or hatred for hot or cold climes, but find prey is easier to come by in areas with more moderate temperatures. Outsider of the moderate climates, more fachen are found in warmer climates rather than colder ones. A few may be found in truly harsh climates, but usually end up there after chasing prey for an extended time. Fachens are more likely to drift than to settle in permanent home or lair. They track food as necessary and find new places to rest in close proximity to their latest kills. They tend to make camp near natural trails or roadways frequented by travelers to ensure a steady supply of meals. However, if a fachen finds a location that ends up being particularly rich in prey, it might attempt to locate a small cave, rocky overhang, or copse of trees to set up as a more permanent residence. However, would-be treasure hunter who locates the lair of a fachen finds only squalor-trinkets or treasures carried by a fachen's meal remain with the corpse. Rumors and myths about fachens are less prevalent in major cities than in small towns, villages, and farmlands. They know that the larger the population, the greater the chance of being put down by local authorities. Like with mother mythical monsters and beasts, tales of prowess and heroics in the face of fachens are often shared over pints of ale and around campfires, and tales of sightings-though hardly believed-are often good for a few free rounds at the local pub. Parents use fachen stories to scare unruly children into behaving or completing their chores. Despite the levity with which they tell tales or make warnings about fachens, residents of these outlying areas still make sure they aren't alone when traveling outside the known safe zones, especially if the trip requires passing through areas where there have been fachen sightings or activity. When the presence of a fachen is conf irmed outside a town or village, the bravest members of that society often band together to kill it or drive it off, knowing the danger of the beast. Yet even so, fachen trophies are rare-even dead, the creatures are frightening to look upon.",1600

Its eyes flare with nightmarish power, and its mouth drips with liquid flame.","Called the Father of All Linnorms, Fafnheir is the oldest and mightiest of his kind to dwell upon Golarion-other, even more powerful linnorms exist on the First World, but on Golarion, Fafnheir is king. Crafty and powerful, Fafnheir is more than just a creature of rage or hunger, and is sometimes known to speak with those who come to him as supplicants for his wisdom. Tales say that to gain Fafnheir's advice, one must travel through Grungir forests to the cavern entrance of the linnorm's lair, whereupon the supplicant must call into the opening several secret names for the ancient linnorm. A single step into the lair renders the supplication moot, for Fafnheir does not suffer intrusions. It is customary to bring a herd of sheep, oxen, or several thralls for him to feast upon. Those who find Fafnheir in a talkative mood and live to tell the tale report that the linnorm is well versed in numerous fields, and capable of working a wide range of magic through wishcrafting, though how much of his bragging is true is debatable. Fafnheir claims to have been the first linnorm to cross to Golarion from the First World after slaying three of that realm's Eldest, as well as to remember a time when the dragon god Dahak came to this world, and to have taken part in ancient battles against humanity as an ally of the serpentfolk. Certain Thassilonian accounts give support to his claim of providing advice and aid at times to Runelord Xanderghul, and he endured the Age of Darkness with ease. The past few thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye for the ancient linnorm, and he expects to survive for thousands more. Fafnheir is aware of the prophecy that the hero who kills him will become king of all Ulfen. The linnorm also knows that in death he will be reborn from the burnt flesh of his slayer, and suggests to those who raise this topic with him that only by becoming him can such a Linnorm King rule. While Fafnheir has seen mchallengers, few have offered him a true battle. Fafnheir spends much of his time slumbering, but wakes quickly at the slightest deviation in the patterns of the world around him, and his dreaming mind touches the woods above and the blood of his children. Those who would come upon him unawares should not expect success unless they travel into his lair from other worlds, for his attunement to Grungir forests is uncanny. The linnorm rarely ventures far from his lair, preferring to lure his enemies close and dispatch them on familiar ground. He loves nothing but his treasure, and cannot be bribed or threatened-the lure of potential treasure does not excite him nearly as much as what he already possesses. He is a subtle combatant, preferring to use trickery before launching into melee. Unlike his lesser kin, Fafnheir has a number of potent, if limited, spell-like abilities, and he often uses his limited wishes to great effect. He has long experience with direct confrontation, and his millennia of action have taught him tricks that few remember. He is one of the most deadly creatures in the Inner Sea region, and even the mightiest dragons fear his power.",820000
Fanged Sea Serpent,6,dragon,waters,"This serpent is 12 to 15 feet long and 5 feet thick. Its body scales are thickened and hardened, which slows it somewhat in waters but provides good protection. The serpent's most outstanding features, however, are the rows of long, sharp teeth that fill its mouth. It has large, lidless red eyes with white pupils.","The fanged sea serpent is a vicious predator of the seas feared for its tendency to travel in packs and swarm over creatures much larger than itself. Fanged sea serpents are nomadic, traveling with oceans currents. They prefer to hunt in groups, which they can surround and attack from all sides. Fanged sea serpents have been known to attack their own kind, but only when starving. Fanged sea serpents on their own usually live on large fish, and avoids confronting intelligent opposition unless they believe their victims to be helpless. However, when they are in groups, they become much more aggressive, and attack creatures much larger than themselves. They prefer to use swarm tactics, surrounding their target and attacking simultaneously from all directions; in the waters, where they can also attack from above and below, few marine creatures can stand up to a prolonged assault.

Faun,1,fey,temperate forests,"This capricious figure has the upper torso, arms, and head of a man, but goatlike legs, a tail, and curling horns on his head.","Often mistaken for satyrs, fauns are far more benevolent than their unpredictable cousins. Mpeople use the two names interchangeably, a fact that irritates both fauns and satyrs. The vast majority of fauns are male, although unlike satyrs, females of this species do exist- they're simply less common than male fauns. While satyrs breeding with their seduced victims always produce full-blooded satyrs, fauns are the result of a willing pairing between satyrs and goodly fey or kindhearted humanoids such as humans or elves. Even in this case, the babies of such unions are usually stolen away and raised by their fey parent or some other sylvan foster family. Like satyrs, fauns enjoy wine, music, dancing, nature, and carnal pleasures. Gentle hedonists, fauns also have a dedicated connection to the countryside, helping hardworking humanoids who make peace with the land and take little more than they need. They help these frontier folk by fighting off significant threats and keeping less savory fey creatures away from their settlements. While they prefer to go unnoticed, in dire times a band of fauns may present themselves to villagers to warn their neighbors of an upcoming threat. Fauns find nymphs exceptionally attractive, more so than all others who dare view them. Nymphs find beauty in fauns' good nature and steadfast dedication to the natural world, and often humor their advances before almost accidentally falling in love with them. As tall as a human, a faun stands on stark white goat legs and has short horns protruding from its head. It also has a short tail that swishes playfully when it is excited or entertained, and its hair falls gracefully around its horns and ears. Its humanoid torso is always lithe but chiseled because of its constant activity and play-fauns rarely laze about too long. Fauns stand nearly 6 feet tall and weigh little more than 150 pounds.",400
Fear Guard,5,undead,underground,"This incorporeal entity appears as a hooded humanoid figure clad in flowing robes of translucent gray over a suit of ghostly armor. Its facial features are a swirl of maddening images, fluctuating between a serene countenance and a face twisted into a grimace of horror and fear.","Fear guards embody evil in its blackest conjuration. They are summoned from some unknown place by evil wizards and clerics to guard prized possessions or a valued location. Shrouding themselves in a preternatural darkness, fear guards fight using spell-like abilities and their incorporeal touch. If guarding a particular location, a fear guard fights until either it is slain or driven away, or its opponents are slain or flee. If exposed to natural sunlight, fear guards either surround themselves with magical darkness for protection or flee if this unsuccessful. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600

It is a solitary creature and disdains all that invade its realm. A fen witch is thoroughly evil and malign, speaking to those she encounters only to learn the true name of one of the trespassers in her realm so she may utilize her power to slay that individual. Fen witches who take class levels usually advance as clerics, druids, sorcerers, or witches. Fen witches rarely engage in combat, relying on their death speak ability to slay a creature almost instantaneously .

Though it is often mistaken for a construct, it is in fact a very intelligent giant. A ferrous giant makes its home deep within a secluded mountains range. Its lair is often a deep cave or cavern or a gigantic castle constructed of iron and built into the face of a mountains. Ferrous giants are generally solitary creatures rarely interacting or dealing with other races, including other giants.

Festrog,1,undead,land,"This hideously malformed, hairless, pustule-covered corpse moves and snarls more like an undead hound than an undead man.","A festrog is an undead abomination spawned when a creature is killed by a massive release of negative energy , and then mutilated by an outside force, such as the scavenging of wild animals. Sometimes called dog-ghouls for their ability to run on all fours, the name often causes opponents to misinterpret this creature's abilities and grossly underestimate its intelligence, for the festrog is in fact a rather canny monstrosity. Festrogs inhabit remote areas near places where they were slain. It's not uncommon for a tribe of festrogs to share territories with ghouls. Most festrogs gather in small bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they might recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings in sunless areas easily defended with group tactics. Like ghouls, they tend to skulk about graveyards, though they prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they can hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs, preferring open areas like plains, farmlands, or open forests where they can track down prey with few places for it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically, often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of mortal flesh.",400

Its eyes are stark blue and its skin is pale white. Ice hangs from its scraggly hair.","When a murdered person is buried on frozen ground, it often returns from the grave as a fetch, an evil undead monster with a hatred of fire and the living. Fetches seek out living creatures that wander too close to their lair, kill them, and often bury them in hope that they rise from their frozen resting place as a fetch. Slain foes not buried are dragged to the fetch's lair and devoured. Fetches savor the flesh of humanoids and monstrous humanoids, in particular humans, elves, and centaurs. A fetch stands anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and weighs between 100 and 250 pounds. Its clothes are tattered and worn with age and exposure. Its rotting flesh is drawn tight around its bones and flushed grayish-white. Its hair is scraggly and frozen and ice crystals cover its skin. A fetch's eyes are stark blue. A fetch is a ruthless opponent, slashing its foes with its wicked claws. Fetches always fight to the death, but are smart enough to flee when presented with fire, if they cannot attack the opponent wielding the fire. If a fetch flees from an encounter because of fire, it follows the one who presented the fire  and eventually exacts its revenge. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",600
Fetchling,0.5,outsider,any,"This gaunt man appears drained of color, like a person viewed at twilight or in a dark alley.","Fetchlings are descended from generations of humans trapped on the Plane of Shadow. Infused with the essence of that plane, they are more and less than human, and often serve as middlemen in planar trade and politics. Other than their yellow eyes, their flesh has no color-it is either stark white, midnight black, or a shade of gray. On the Material Plane, they conceal themselves with heavy clothing or dim light so they can work without prejudice. The name ""fetchling"" is a human word; their own name for their race is kayal, meaning ""shadow people.""

Fey Giant Toad,3,fey,"temperate forests, plains, or swamps","Little about this enormous toad is ordinary, from its graceful wings to its colorful purple and pink skin to its bright, shining eyes.","Fey creatures resemble the mundane creatures they derive from, but with brighter colors, delicate features, and elegant wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their fragile-seeming appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as their non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for grace and the ability to fly. They live long lives, barring death by misadventure, and rarely show outward signs of age. Some fey creatures owe their nature to fey ancestors interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures and were infused with fey essence through the magic of learned spellcasters or the inf luence of ancient powers of nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely dwell in civilized lands, both by preference and because the conditions that give rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched by great fey powers, fey creatures soon seek them out. Though more prone to mischief than mayhem, fey creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim view of interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foul-tempered intruders risk humiliation at best if they insult the fey, and much worse if they raise arms against them. More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed though sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn powers to lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into mere inconvenience. Fey creatures generally have cordial relationships with animals, allies of nature such as druids, and other fey. Exceptions exist where rival communities of fey dwell in proximity to one another. In these cases, fey creatures in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according to their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such conflicts. Fey creatures derived from horses and the like often serve as mounts, though only to other fey or to allies of nature who acknowledge them as at least near-equals, if not full partners. CREATING A FEY CREATURE ""Fey Creature"" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to living, corporeal creature. A fey creature retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: 9 HD or less, as base creature +1; 10 HD or more, as base creature +2. Alignment: Any non-lawful. Type: The creature's type changes to fey. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Senses: A fey creature gains low-light vision. Armor Class: Reduce the creature's natural armor, if any, by 1 . Defensive Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, resist cold and electricity 10, and DR 5/cold iron  or DR 10/ cold iron . Speed: Unless the base creature flies better, the fey creature flies at 1-1/2 times the base creature's land speed , rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 feet. If the creature already has flight with a maneuverability of good, it increases to perfect. Special Abilities: A fey creature gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof. Camouflage  A fey creature can use Stealth to hide in sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with racial Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature. Change Shape  A fey creature can change shape into a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size category, or an animal within one size category. In all cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than once, granting an additional form each time. Energy Resistance  A fey creature gains resistance 10 to one energy type, or increases an existing resistance by 10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity instead. This ability can be selected more than once. Evasion  A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue ability of the same name. Long Step  A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. Spell Resistance  A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 + its CR. This does not stack with existing SR possessed by the base creature. Trackless Step  A fey creature does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. Vanish  As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for 1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for 1 round per day per Hit Die. Woodland Stride  A fey creature can move through sort of undergrowth  at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect it. Optionally, this ability may function in a different type of terrain, to allow the fey creature to move through, swamps, rocky areas, ice, and so forth. Whatever the choice, this ability only functions in one type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than once, for a different terrain each time. Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice.

Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fey animal's Hit Dice + the fey animal's Charisma modifier. Death Curse : When a creature slays a fey animal, the slayer is cursed with ill luck unless it makes a successful Will saving throw to resist the curse. If it fails to resist, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws until the curse is removed. The total penalty from multiple fey animal death curses stacks, but the multiple death curses count as a single curse overall for the purposes of removing its effects. A fey creature can see this curse on a creature as an angry red halo around the victim's head. Spell-Like Abilities: A fey animal has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD.

Fire drakes lair in caves and caverns deep within the hills and mountains. Fire drakes are carnivorous creatures and very territorial, fighting other drakes that move into their area. They are tolerant of other fire drakes, but view them with suspicion. On occasion, a mated pair is encountered, but only in the late summer months or early autumn. Fire drakes are often mistaken for young or miniature red dragons. A typical fire drake is 4 feet long, though it can grow to a length of 6 feet.

A fire elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall, composed of yellow-orange fire and flame. Its face lacks discernable features, though sometimes, two pinpoints of white-hot fire seem to appear on its head, perhaps functioning as eyes. Its arms and legs end in tormented elemental faces, each howling and screaming  at its imprisonment. A fire elemental construct batters and pummels its foes with its flaming fists. Occasionally, the elemental grapples a foe and pulls it into its burning form. Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like other automaton follows order or command given to it to the best of its ability. An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person , but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone. Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

Once it enters the plane, it often lies in wait in the fire for potential victims to come near it. A fire phantom hiding inside a fire is difficult to see requiring DC 25 Perception check. A fire phantom waits inside its fire until it spots a living creature. It then rushes out, shrieking and hurling globes of fire. If faced with overwhelming odds or facing certain destruction, the fire phantom either moves as close as possible to as mfoes as possible or attempts to draw in as mof its opponents as possible and uses it immolation ability. In normal melee, the fire phantom alternates between hurling globes of fire and pummeling a foe with its burning fists. When a fire phantom is wounded, flames dance and play around the wound. Fire phantoms fight until destroyed or all opponents are dead or flee. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Fire Snake,1,outsider,Plane of Fire,This creature looks like a snake with reddish-orange scales and stark white eyes without pupils.,"A fire snake resembles a normal snake and ranges in size from 2 feet to 6 feet in length. Fire snakes make their homes in fires and rarely journey more than 30 feet from such an open flame. Sages conjecture that fire snakes are some form of larval salamander from the Plane of Fire. A fire snake's preferred method of attack is to hide in a nearby fire and then surprise its foes as they come nearby. A fire snake attacks by biting its opponents with its sharp fangs.

Fire Whale,10,magical beast,oceans of fire,"Surfacing from the sea of flames rises, a titanic crimson whale mottled with pattern of yellow and orange spots running down its dorsal fins. Its huge, angular mouth hangs open, exposing its hideous gaping gullet.","All manner of fiery waters life swims the Sea of Fire, including the majestic fire whales. These 30-foot long mammals are relatively peaceful creatures, though if provoked they quickly become deadly adversaries. Fire whales generally spend their time feeding on elemental invertebrates that move along the bottom of the Sea of Fire. When feeding, the fire whale dives to the bottom, flips on its side, and swims along, running its head through the fiery and oily sea floor scooping food into its mouth. Fire whales generally take in enough food to sustain themselves for 4 months . Late in the year  fire whales gather for their mating ritual. During this time as mas 7 fire whales can be encountered together. Sages are unsure as to the purpose of the ""extra"" fire whales, but each spends its share rolling and milling with the others during this ritual. Gestation for fire whales is generally 11 months after which time the mother gives birth to 1d2 calves. While the calves are growing, both they and the mother spend most of their time in the shallower ends of the Sea of Fire. After nearly 7 months, they migrate to deeper waters and most calves swim away and become independent. Young reach maturity around 6 years of age. Fire whales are hunted by various races for their meat, blubber, and oil. Of the races that hunt them the most are the salamanders, volcano giants , and the efreet of the City of Brass. Fire whales are generally peaceful creatures and rarely attack unless threatened. If forced into combat, a fire whale attacks with its bite and tail slap. Surface creatures that threaten a fire whale are subjected to its scalding blast attack. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600
Fire Yai,15,outsider,temperate or warm hills or mountains,"This fanged, three-eyed giant rages in its finely crafted armor, its skin as red as a smoldering ember.","Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built abode is essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build or inhabit a fortified stone dwelling in its territory, and surrounds itself with as mluxuries as it can acquire. Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive of their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting fire yai to act rashly. They rarely let challenges pass uncontested and react quickly to squelch threat to their rule. While mfire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to infiltrate and rule, not all follow this compulsion. Capable of assuming the form of mtypes of humanoid, some fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire nations of humanoids from within.

First Blade,15,outsider,battle,"The sound of clashing steel upon a battlefield resounds with every step of this ironclad giant. Its armor bears harsh but elaborate flourishes, as though it were the war regalia of some merciless warlord. Each plate looks impossibly thick and heavy, like the hulking titan within is completely hidden by layer upon layer of tightly woven chain and impregnable steel.","Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum's blade during one of his first clashes with a long-felled god-beast of the Outer Sphere, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum's divine bloodlust, this shard of the god of battle's blade continues to obey and do battle in the service of its divine master. Having been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum's perfect warrior, the First Blade serves as the war god's herald, traveling where its master desires. Yet while the heralds of most deities go forth to bear the word of their divine patrons or answer the most desperate summons of their gods' most pious servants, the First Blade endlessly marches to battle. Never interested in diplomacy or subtlety, Gorum has little need for a messenger other than one capable of communicating in the language of the battlefield. The god of battle answers the calls only of those who please him in battle and request his heralds' aid in epic clashes dedicated to his honor- weakling priests seeking salvation or cowardly revenge never have their entreaties for the herald's presence answered. The appearance of the First Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape, the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound. Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald of Gorum typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons. Ecology Although a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon of Gorum, knowing little beyond its lord's command and going only where he wills. Like a golem in mrespects, the herald leaves but scant traces upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth. Although the First Blade can speak a variety of languages, few of those encountering the herald have heard it do so. Like its master, the First Blade prefers actions-especially violent, purposeful ones-to words. Typically its words are brief refutations of those who have summoned it for an unfit purpose, though several legends tell of the divine messenger offering its respect or the pleasure of its master before striking the final blow upon an opponent who has put up a particularly capable fight or proven her prowess on the field of battle. Habitat & Society While the herald of Gorum answers the call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lord's intervention in appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade responding to summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between history's greatest warlords. Rumors among Gorum's clergy also suggest that sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed remains a subject of some debate among theologians.",51200
Fjord Linnorm,16,dragon,cold mountains coastlines,"This massive, eel-like dragon has two webbed talons. Its tail ends in large and powerful-looking flukes.","Fjord linnorms dwell among the deep waters that grace northern coastlines where fingers of land create complex rivulets, venturing out to sea to feed on sharks and whales when they cannot find settlements or traveling caravans to savage. As their favored haunts often overlap with coastlines trade routes, regions known to be within the territory of a fjord linnorm are often avoided by ships. Fjord linnorms are not particularly adept at capsizing ships, as are some other large waters monsters, but one might argue that such tactics are unnecessary for a creature the size and power of a fjord linnorm in the first place. Both the curse and poison of a fjord linnorm are extremely dangerous for those who frequent the watersways of the north. The fjord linnorm's curse is particularly devastating to waters creatures, and such beings are careful to avoid possible conflict with such linnorms.

Males and females form their own packs divided by gender, coming together only during the annual mating season. Flame drakes mate once a year. Males play no part in raising their offspring, and abandon their partners soon after mating. Females lay clutches of two or three eggs in secluded mountains nests, and raise their hatchlings for only 2 years before rejoining their packs and abandoning their offspring to their fates.

Flaming Skull,0.5,undead,any,"This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.","Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how mcan be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in way and applied to of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching : A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type  chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning : This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn  special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing : This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming : Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chillsing scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming skull's Cha modifier.

A flesh golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. A flesh golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiffjointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Although most flesh golems are mindless, there are persistent rumors of unusual golems who somehow retain the memories of a previous life.

Fleshdreg,1,aberration,ruins,"Composed of half-formed body parts, this creature stands on two monstrous legs. A mouth full of jagged teeth dominates the creature's bulbous head. Its veins pulse just beneath transparent flesh.","Sometimes a runewell becomes erratic after millennia without maintenance and disgorges an incomplete horror. Such misshapen lumps of tissue, appendages, and biting mouths are called fleshdregs. These incomplete sinspawn creep around forgotten ruins of the Thassilonian empire. Some escape the ruins and make their way to the surface to feed upon the sins of humankind. Fleshdregs vary in appearance from one another depending on various factors, such as the sins that powered their creation and the runewells that spawned them. Wrathful fleshdregs develop with a more predatory form than lustful fleshdregs do, and slothful fleshdregs look like little more than bloated piles of flesh atop stubby legs. Most fleshdregs stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh little more than 60 pounds. Greed fleshdregs are the tallest of their kind, and sloth fleshdregs the heaviest. Ecology Fleshdregs are practically immortal. They require little food to sustain their unnatural physiology, and don't seem to age or mature beyond the moment of creation. Violence or accidents claim the lives of fleshdregs more often than anything else. Fleshdregs emerge from runewells that have malfunctioned over the ages-no self-respecting follower of Thassilonian magic would want to create such pitiful creatures, after all. Sometimes a runewell absorbs particularly sinful souls through a soul lens without the device being calibrated correctly; other times, a creature is marked with a Sihedron rune to have its soul collected, and the inscriber performs the ritual incorrectly. In either case, the collected sins cause the runewell to vomit forth these broken, spoiled sinspawn. Habitat & Society Fleshdregs follow true sinspawn around like pets or curious children. Sinspawn use these weaker creatures as slaves, troops, or hunting companions. Though they're treated horribly, fleshdregs still seek out the compof their larger, more advanced cousins. Despite their low intelligence, these pitiful creatures recognize the Sihedron rune and its connection to their creation. Mfleshdregs remain in the ruins of their birthplace, surrounded by Sihedron runes, for this very reason, waiting patiently for the return of their runelord masters. Fleshdregs behave differently according to their associated sins. Sloth fleshdregs rarely hunt for sinful creatures, preferring to keep to their lairs, while wrath fleshdregs are the most likely to wander outside of a Thassilonian ruin as they seek to spread rage.",400

It is unknown if flinds are a subspecies of the gnoll or a genetic anomaly produced among large gnoll packs. Flinds are often found among gnoll bands acting as leaders, as their strength and relatively superior intelligence puts them above their lesser brethren. Flind combat tactics are similar to those of gnolls. They prefer to strike from ambush, using terrain and concealment to their best advantage. They are most often seen acting in the role of leaders to gnoll bands, keeping discipline with a ruthless hand and little mercy. Flind Characters Flind leaders are always fighters.

Foo Dog,2,outsider,any,"There can be no mistaking this animal-like creature for a mere beast, for its face has an almost supernaturally human look to it.","Foo creatures are benevolent guardian spirits that hail originally from the Outer Plane of Nirvana, where they spend their days cavorting in the idyllic wilds or aiding that realm's inhabitants, particularly the agathions, in their work. Yet while they come from Nirvana, foo creatures are often encountered on the Material Plane as well, for they are favorite conjurations of mcultures and religions. Countless species of foo creatures exist-for if an animal dwells upon the Material Plane, it is certain that somewhere in the vast wilds of Nirvana its spiritual double frolics and plays. Nonetheless, certain foo creatures are more common than others, and the most often encountered of all are dogs and lions. A foo creature can be called to the Material Plane for reason a conjurer can imagine-these monsters are generally much more intelligent than their mundane counterparts, and can not only follow complex orders but can speak and converse as well. Typically, a foo creature is contacted to serve for a time as a guardian-by adopting its statue form using its freeze ability, a foo creature can appear as little more than an ornate decoration astride the facade of a building or standing guard over a fountain in a city plaza. They are not as often called upon to serve as soldiers in armies, for foo creatures detest war. They generally dislike serving as mounts as well, although for particularly pious and kindly folk, they have been known to make exceptions. CREATING A FOO CREATURE ""Foo Creature"" is an inherited template that can be added to animal, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A foo creature retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1. Alignment: Any good. Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider with the good subtype. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: As the base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet. AC: A foo creature's natural armor bonus increases by +2. Hit Dice: The base creature's racial Hit Dice change to d10s. Defensive Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities. It also gains the following. Damage Reduction : A foo creature gains DR/ bludgeoning based on its Hit Dice. A foo creature with up to 10 HD gains DR 5/bludgeoning. A foo creature with 11 or more HD gains DR 10/bludgeoning. Paired Protectors : When two or more foo creatures are within 30 feet of one another, they both gain the benefit of a protection from evil spell. The caster level of this protection from evil effect is equal to the highest Hit Dice of the affected foo creatures. This effect can be dispelled, but if it is, a foo creature can reactivate it as a swift action. Stony Defense : A number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice, a foo creature can harden its skin to unyielding stone as an immediate action. It gains hardness 8 until the end of its next turn, but its speed is reduced by 10 feet for the same duration. Special Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base creature's special attacks and special abilities. It also gains the following special quality. Freeze : A foo creature can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A foo creature that uses freeze can take 10 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue. A foo creature can maintain this position for as long as it wishes. Abilities: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence. Feats: All foo creatures gain Iron Will as a bonus feat. Languages: All foo creatures speak Common and Celestial. CREATING AN IMPERIAL FOO CREATURE Among foo creatures there exist what are known as the ""imperials""-the leaders of particular races of foo creatures. Imperial foo creatures are much more powerful than the typical examples of their kind, and possess a wide array of additional magical powers. Each imperial foo creature is a unique entity; only one exists at one time. When an imperial foo creature is slain, the next most powerful foo creature of its species immediately transcends to this role to replace the one that was lost. To create an imperial foo creature, first generate the statistics for a regular foo creature. The steps you'll go through to create the imperial version of that foo creature are more akin to those you'd go through to advance a creature by Hit Dice rather than a standard template. Step One-Increase Ability Scores: Upon becoming an imperial, the foo creature gains a +6 bonus to all of its ability scores, save for Intelligence, which increases to 20 . Step Two-Advance Hit Dice: An imperial foo creature always has at least double the original foo creature's Hit Dice-you can give the imperial foo creature even more Hit Dice than this if you want to make a particularly powerful one. Base attack bonus, saves, skill ranks, feats, and all other variables dependant upon Hit Dice change as normal. Step Three-Increase Size: Increase the foo creature's size by one category, applying the modifiers for size changes as summarized on Table 2-2 on page 296 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. Step Four-Spellcasting: An imperial foo creature casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for an imperial foo creature. The imperial foo creature gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, but gains no other class ability normally granted by the sorcerer class. Step Five-Determine CR: Compare the foo creature's statistics to those presented on Table 1-1 on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary to determine the creature's final CR. An imperial foo creature has a minimum CR score of 11.

A long spike adorns its thrashing tail.","forests drakes are the degenerate cousins of green dragons, possessed of cruel cunning but little actual wit. Like most drakes, forests drakes are bullies, prowling deep forests in search of their favorite prey-elves and fey. forests drakes eagerly attack communities of such forests creatures unless driven off with arrows or other shows of force. Like mother drake types, forests drakes organize themselves in packs called ""rampages,"" and keep communal lairs in secluded forests locations. Such packs are usually made up of siblings who break from the pack only during mating season. A forests drake pack has a distinct pecking order, with younger and newer members receiving the least desirable portions of pack kills and the fewest mating options. forests drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon as they hatch. forests drake hatchlings immediately band together in a pack. While few survive so long, forests drakes can live up to 200 years. forests drakes are typically about 10 feet long with equally long tails, and weigh around 1,000 pounds.",1200
forestser's Bane,5,plant,temperate plains,"This creature resembles a huge, dark green shrub.","The forestser's bane is a huge, immobile, and carnivorous shrub. Closer inspection reveals large, tough leaves radiating from its central stalk. These dark green leaves hide six purple serrated stalks inside its body. At the center of this low-growing shrub is a 3-foot diameter yellowish orb from which sprout msmall green branches. Each branch has small, sweet smelling  berries of various colors growing from it. When a living creature moves near a forestser's bane's leaves, it attempts to grab the creature. Trapped creatures are subjected to attacks by several serrated stalks that slash and cut until the opponent escapes. The forestser's bane releases a trapped victim when either it or the victim is dead, or the leaf holding the victim is destroyed. The snapper saw can also attack with its stalks without first grappling an opponent.

Forgefiend,10,outsider,underground,"A massive, fire-filled maw splits the belly of this lumbering iron-skinned fiend, whose short arms end in razor-sharp claws.","Scanderigs, more commonly known as ""forgefiends,"" look like large, heavily armored, barrel-shaped giants, with enormous mouths in their bellies in addition to the normal-sized ones in their heads. They are native to the Plane of Earth, but sometimes make their way through subterranean portals onto the Material Plane, where they gorge themselves on rich and relatively uncontested mineral veins. A forgefiend might live quite happily inside a mountains's heart for centuries, only causing trouble when the ore runs out or interlopers attempt to mine its territory. Forgefiends are particularly feared in mdwarven societies. In addition to their penchant for destroying deep forges, they are often portrayed as boogeyman-like figures for frightening dwarven children and instilling good smithing habits-for it is said, ""For every scrap of slag you waste, a scanderig is making haste. Those who use excessive ore find forgefiends scratching at their door!""",9600
Forgotten One,2,fey,forests,"This is a small 1-foot tall creature with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and long lithe limbs. Its hair is brightly colored and decorated with leaves and twigs and it is dressed in greenish-brown clothes. It carries a tiny spear in its hands.","Forgotten ones are a sprite race related to pixies. These wee folk are natural spies and trackers, and are routinely employed by powerful forests-guarding fey creatures such as unicorns, dryads, and nymphs. It is not uncommon for travelers in a fey forests to be followed by scores of forgotten ones, all moving unnoticed through the treetops as quickly and quietly as squirrels. While some forgotten ones keep track of the interlopers, others send messages back and forth to alert more powerful fey guardians to the presence of outsiders. A forgotten one is about a foot tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and long, nimble limbs. Most forgotten ones weave twigs and leaves into their hair for decoration and to help conceal themselves in the treetops. Rangers are druids are especially fond of the forgotten ones, and often use them as intermediaries between themselves and the greater Fey guardians of the forests. Forgotten ones try to avoid combat with anything larger than themselves-they are well aware of their own limitations. If hard pressed or ordered into combat by a greater fey creature to defend their forests, forgotten ones will fight with courage not often attributed to creatures of such small size.

Forlarren,2,fey,temperate plains or forests,"This humanoid creature has the legs of a bald goat, a completely hairless body, and a horned head with a sinister expression.","A nymph's charm and beauty are such that she can seduce nearly creature that she sets her attentions on-and often, unfortunately, creatures she would rather not consort with. When a nymph catches the attention of a fiend and the fiend takes advantage of the creature, the resulting offspring is not always a half-fiend. Roughly one in 20 such incidents results instead in a strange creature known as a forlarren-a unique creature that possesses its own unusual abilities and qualities. Few nymphs survive the ordeal of giving birth to a forlarren- those who do might attempt to raise their children in loving environments, but the evil that lurks in a forlarren's soul is powerful. In most cases where a nymph attempts to raise a forlarren child, it's only a matter of time before the forlarren grows resentful and its evil nature compels it to murder its mother. Most forlarrens are female, and few are capable of conceiving children of their own. A forlarren grows to adulthood with astonishing speed, reaching full growth in only a year-even those who come into the world as orphans are capable of defending themselves and seeking out food. Yet despite the rapidity with which they reach maturity, few forlarrens survive to adulthood. Cast out from both sylvan and fiendish society, the typical forlarren is a lonely creature, cursed by its own existence. It detests itself and everything it sees, and soon becomes consumed by hatred of life itself. The forlarren vents its rage on good and evil alike, lashing out at anything that approaches it. The forlarren attacks with its clawed hands, typically focusing on a single opponent at a time and attacking until it or its opponent is slain. Yet curiously, when a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother sometimes surface, and it shows profound remorse for its cruelty. With such a pendulum of erratic behavior, it is no wonder that forlarrens are all but incapable of forming lasting friendships-even with others of their own kind. The majority of forlarrens inherit little in the way of the magical abilities possessed by their fey mothers, but they do gain a small measure of the powers of their fiendish fathers. In most cases, this manifests as the ability to use heat metal three times per day, but some forlarren instead gain a different spell-like ability chosen from the following list: chills metal, flame blade, flaming sphere, gust of wind, summon swarm, or warp wood. A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds. In theory, these creatures can live for hundreds of years, but most perish through violence before they turn 10.",600
Forsaken Lich,12,undead,any,"This horribly withered creature moves in jerks and twitches as if constantly wracked with pain. Waves of shadow undulate through the creature's body, emerging like appendages from just beneath its dry, stretched skin.","The means of attaining lichdom are extremely personal for mortal spellcasters, fraught with misinformation and peril. The smallest miscalculation in the potion of lichdom's formula or most minute flaw in one's phylactery can interrupt the process that infuses one's mortal soul with overwhelming arcane and negative energies. Other times, an inexperienced wizard attempts the transformation, or erroneously consumes a formula produced for another spellcaster, instantly dying from the backlash of potent forces or condemning himself to a terminal but far more terrible end. In these sorrowful cases, the process traps the soul of the would-be lich outside a phylactery that will not accept it and a body that has rejected it. The potent arcane forces tampered with by the lich's failed creation also find themselves unleashed but uncontrolled, surrounding the newly formed abomination, empowering it but also slowly consuming its essence. This creature, known as a forsaken lich, is granted the undeath it sought in life, but in a terrifyingly temporary fashion. For the miscalculations of its ambitions, the creature's once-vibrant body shrivels and decays like that of a lich, but becomes a lifeless shell manipulated by the malicious soul and unchecked magical storm that envelop it, forces that control the corpse's actions almost like a marionette. Yet this doom is temporary for nearly all who attempt this foul transition. With the soul unbound from the body and both spirit and corpse exposed to destructive arcane tides, both are slowly eroded. After 1d10 days, the forsaken lich's body and soul are both consumed like a lit candle, eventually reduced physically to ashes, and spiritually to nothing-its essence utterly annihilated, scoured from existence for all time. Creating a Forsaken Lich ""Forsaken lich"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature , provided it can create the required phylactery. Rarely, a creature unable to create a phylactery stumbles upon this state through tragic ambition. A forsaken lich retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A forsaken lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A forsaken lich has a +3 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, forsaken liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A forsaken lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, spell resistance 25, and immunity to cold and electricity, in addition to immunities granted by its undead traits. The forsaken lich also gains the following defensive abilities. Soul Shield : The shadowy double superimposed over the forsaken lich's corporeal form flits around its body, granting the creature concealment . The miss chance increases to 50% in dim light. This ability never grants total concealment; it only increases miss chances. Spell Storm : A forsaken lich is the epicenter of a squall of unchecked magical energies. If a spell targets the forsaken lich and fails to overcome its spell resistance, this uncontrolled magic redirects the spell as per spell turning. The forsaken lich is always considered to have 10 spell levels of turning left for the purposes of this effect, even if it is affected by multiple spells in the same round. Special Attacks: A forsaken lich gains the special attack described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the forsaken lich's HD + the forsaken lich's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Disembodied Strike : The forsaken lich has a special touch attack that it can make as a standard action, using its highest base attack bonus. This attack originates when its disembodied soul reaches out independently and uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures + 1 point of damage per every 2 Hit Dice possessed by the forsaken lich. This attack has a reach 5 feet greater than the forsaken lich's normal reach, and may be directed at nearby undead creatures to heal them, or used on the forsaken lich itself to heal damage inf licted on its corporeal form. Soul Lash : Unbridled magic endlessly funnels into a forsaken lich's body, scouring its body and soul with mighty energies. As a swift action, each round a forsaken lich can unleash this dark energy in a blast of pure magical destructiveness. This blast takes the form of a 240-foot line of destructive energy that deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 per 2 Hit Dice the forsaken lich possesses  and paralyzes those affected for 1d10 rounds. Creatures that make a Ref lex save partially avoid the arcane lash, taking only half damage and avoiding the paralysis. This energy is not completely under the forsaken lich's control. If the forsaken lich does not spend a swift action to discharge the energy every round, it takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 x 1/4 of its total Hit Dice. Special Qualities: A forsaken lich gains the following special quality. Delusory Aura : Like its soul, a forsaken lich's mind is discorporated and scattered across the area around its corpse. This fills the area within 100 feet of the forsaken lich with an ever-shifting panoply of its darkest dreams, dashed ambitions, and enraged insanity. This area is considered to be under the effects of mirage arcana, but of a particularly disturbing variety. All living creatures within the area take a -4 penalty on saves against fear effects. If the effect is dispelled, it reconstitutes 1 round later. Abilities: Str +6, Cha +6. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.",19200
Fossil Golem,12,construct,any,"Fossilized bones make up the body of this animated construct, from its horned shoulders to its tyrannosaur-skulled hands.","A fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of long-dead dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. These bones are generally not assembled with attempt to accurately model the original creature-usually, the skulls of powerful predatory dinosaurs  serve in the place of hands, granting the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an additional peril-they transform fossilization into a terrible form of contagion that can affect creature they damage. Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns and other natural fortifications. A fossil golem at rest might look to the untrained eye like nothing more than a strange display of bones.

Four-armed,3,monstrous humanoid,temperate or warm oceans,"This burly humanoid has sharp scales and fins like some predatory fish. As if its maw full of serrated teeth were not intimidating enough, the monstrosity clenches deadly claws at the ends of four powerful arms.","The unpredictability and viciousness of the sahuagin race isn't just an aspect of their sharklike temperament- it seems to be inherent in their very beings. The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest to this, their forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, sahuagin mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in sahuagin communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among their people's rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed sahuagin brutes and malenti- sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves-arise most commonly, though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage seas. Sahuagin Alterations Both the four-armed sahuagin and the malenti use the stats presented on page 239 of the Bestiary as their foundations, with the following alterations. As sahuagin are such common menaces over the course of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path, their variants are included here to make encounters with the shark people even more unpredictable and deadly. Four-Armed Sahuagin: These mutants gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus feats and the multiweapon mastery ability. These changes do not include an increase in such a mutant's Hit Dice, but do increase its CR to 3. Despite the advantages these additions give the creature, its hit points are on the low side for a CR 3 monster. GMs should consider giving four-armed sahuagin armor considerably better than that usually worn by CR 3 monsters to make up for this relative glass jaw. Giving the creature leather armor  grants it a +2 armor bonus, increasing its AC to 18-above the average for its CR, but a considered benefit to help balance out its weakness. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, rangers, and warriors. Malenti: These mutants gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, Deceitful and Skill Focus  as bonus feats, and command as a spell-like ability . Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. The benefits a malenti gains largely offset those it loses, resulting in no change to the creature's CR. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards. Other Sahuagin Mutants Although four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common sahuagin mutants, they are not the only abnormalities to arise from sahuagin stock. The following mutants are also sometimes found in sahuagin societies. While rarer than other mutants, they too quickly garner the respect and fear of their piscine brethren. Prehistoric Sahuagin: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to some even more savage epoch; they are Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with waters dinosaurs and megafauna in addition to sharks. They are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures or waters that are somehow strangely affected by the flow of time. Shark-Blooded Sahuagin: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of sharklike teeth, and the fins and tail of an oversized thresher shark . These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a swim speed of 80 feet, and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Shark-blooded sahuagin are most typically found in sahuagin communities with unusually high numbers of shark guardians and near shark breeding grounds. Spined Sahuagin: Covered in hundreds of needle-like spines, these sahuagin can raise these piercing protrusions to impale creatures that attempt to grab or consume them. Any creature that grapples a spined sahuagin takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training as a bonus feat. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive waters predators.",800

A long, serpentine tail, gray and yielding to blue near the barbed end, trails behind it. Two large bat-like wings protrude from its back.","Fraz-Urb'luu is one of the most physically powerful demon princes as well as one of the most cunning. His deceptions range far and wide, affecting and influencing not only those on the Material Plane but also other demon princes and demon lords. His malevolent nature lends itself well to his trickery and deception, and he bends others to do his will. Those that oppose him are quickly dispatched. Those he favors are often captured and taken back to his lair in the Abyss where they are forced into a life of servitude. When the day comes that Fraz-Urb'luu grows weary of them, he devours them or throws them to his other servants to do with as they wish. He makes his home deep within the Abyss on a smoldering and scarred layer devoid of most life. His keep is a large iron and stone castle situated near the very center of the layer. A constant stream of traffic emanates to and from his castle; demons and slaves tending to their daily tasks. Fraz-Urb'luu stands 18 feet tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds. Fraz-Urb'luu opens combat by pounding his foes with his spells or spelllike abilities. He next assaults them physically by pummeling with his powerful fists and slashing with his tail. A grabbed foe is entwined in his tail and gnashed between the demon prince's fangs. One of Fraz-Urb'luu's favorite tactics, after wearing down his opponents, is to summon a demon prince and then immediately teleport away as the prince arrives. Servants of Fraz-Urb'luu Followers of Fraz-Urb'luu are usually evil humanoids and consist of clerics, politicians or aristocrats, sorcerers, and adepts. Devout followers of Fraz- Urb'luu are called Deceivers and must sign a pact of evil with Fraz-Urb'luu.

Frost Drake,7,dragon,cold mountains,This two-legged dragon has dull blue scales tinged with bright blue ice. A freezing mist issues from between its powerful jaws.,"Degenerate cousins of white dragons, frost dragons are ferocious predators. They are larger than other drakes, reaching heights of up to 16 feet and weighing upward of 2,500 pounds. Their wide, clawed feet enable them to easily burrow through snow, though not through dirt or clay. Young frost drakes form adolescent hunting packs divided along gender lines, but older frost drakes are usually encountered in mated pairs. Frost drakes mate for life, leaving their packs when they find a suitable mate. Mated pairs make a nest together, and the female lays a clutch of two to five eggs. Both parents care for their offspring when they hatch, and families usually form small packs until the young reach maturity at 5 years of age. At this point, the parents abandon their offspring, usually laying a new clutch of eggs in a new nest elsewhere, and leaving the fledgling drakes to find their own adolescent packs to join.",3200
Frost Giant,9,humanoid,cold mountains,"This giant looks like a thick, muscular human. It has frost-white skin and long, light blue hair that it wears braided.","A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old. Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain. Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords. Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves and commodities. Every group of frost giants typically has 1-2 humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler- usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets- white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found dwelling in a frost giant lair.",6400

Each carries his personal belongings in small sacks and takes them wherever he goes. A frost man's body radiates cold out to 30 feet, though not enough to deal damage. There is much speculation on the society of frost men. Other beings only encounter them as lone males. Speculation suggests that there must be villages somewhere with women and children, perhaps buried deep in cold mountains caves. Tribes that are aware of frost men fear them greatly for their deadly talent and refer to them as ""ice demons."" Frost men appear in the outside world occasionally and wish only to go about their unknown business undisturbed. Anyone bothering them can expect to be attacked.

Frost Wight,4,undead,any,"The pale flesh of this walking corpse is rotting and putrid, its body skeletal in places, ice and frost cling to its hair, and its eye sockets glow with blue-white light.","Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like.

Frost Worm,12,magical beast,cold plains or mountains,This immense white worm has a single circular eye in the center of its head. Wisps of icy fog waft up from between its mandibles.,"With armor-crushing jaws, flesh that radiates cold, and a terrible keening cry capable of holding creatures fascinated, frost worms are apex predators of the frozen tundra and glaciers. In the frost worms' far-reaching hunting grounds, they fear only the remorhaz, for the heat generated by an enraged remorhaz causes intense pain to a frost worm. This extreme aversion to heat, as well as its freezing touch and devastating breath weapon, stems from an unusual facet of frost worm physiology-veins that run with magically cold blood. This creature's ichor is clear, but infused with such sub-freezing temperatures that the monster's flesh can freeze waters in the skin of creatures that touch it. When a frost worm dies, this magical energy dissipates, and both blood and muscle immediately freeze solid and then explode into a catastrophic barrage of icy shrapnel. As a result, even those predators that might legitimately prey upon the burrowing monstrosities tend to leave frost worms well enough alone. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.",19200
Frostfallen Mammoth,10,undead,cold land,"This frozen mammoth erupts into movement, its bones armored with plates of ice and eyes burning with cold flames.","Frostfallen creatures are mindless undead infused with icy cold and animated by a hatred for all living things. Their bodies radiate a devastating chills that cloaks them in patches of ice that act as armor. Frostfallen creatures appear otherwise as they did at the time of their reanimation, except for a cold gleam in the eyes. Ecology In the harshest reaches of the world, cold is an ever-present enemy. When a creature dies from exposure to such harsh conditions, bitter anger and the searing cold sometimes combine to reanimate the dead as one of the frostfallen. Once reanimated, frostfallen creatures prowl the cold lands in which they fell, wreaking indiscriminate vengeance on living creatures out of spiteful rage. Although frostfallen creatures can be created through necromantic magic like other undead, arcane scholars are fascinated by the necromancy that brings frostfallen creatures to unlife, for the animating force is a synthesis of negative energy and a bone-numbing cold. This cold empowers the creature's attacks, wreathing its natural weapons in a deathly chills. Those who have fought these creatures describe great wounds instantly numbed by the lethal touch of frostbite. In addition, a frostfallen creature's body emanates an aura of cold that flash-freezes moisture in the air around it, coating the creature in a patchwork of ice capable of def lecting blows from even the heaviest weapons. The creature's affinity for cold also allows it to locate nearby warm-blooded creatures, even in driving blizzards and on moonless nights. Frostfallen creatures move with the same gaits they had in life, while gaining a savage surge in physical power. Additionally, unlike normal zombies, the frozen condition of the creature fortifies its unlife, making it extremely durable. Indeed, throughout the northern reaches of Avistan, legends persist of specific frostfallen mammoths, dire bears, and even giants that have hunted the Crown of the World for centuries. Habitat & Society The corrupt animus that powers frostfallen creatures imbues them with a hatred of all living things, and most spend their time wandering wintry terrains near where they died, looking for life to snuff out. Sometimes, vestiges of behavior from their original forms lead to groups banding together, like frostfallen wolves that hunt in packs. Even those frostfallen that have never encountered others of their kind seem to instinctively recognize their own, and band together if prey is nearby. In Irrisen, winter witches and other ice casters prefer creating frostfallen creatures, as such creatures' bodies more readily withstand the decay and brittleness often faced by skeletons and zombies in harsh northern climes. Casters who create frostfallen creatures often use minor magic to emblazon a creature's ice armor with carvings or specific colors, effectively branding the creature as a servant. On rare occasions, casters will create frostfallen creatures in warmer regions like the Mwangi Expanse or the deserts of Thuvia. Despite the scorching heat of such places, frostfallen creatures retain all of their powers. In such cases, the undead's creator normally employs her minions against creatures that are susceptible to the frostfallen creature's freezing attacks. Some frostfallen creatures have even survived independent of their creators. When such a rarity comes to pass, the frostfallen creature simply begins hunting the region for fresh life to end, though it will often lie in wait in cooler places like deep caves, or under the waters of an oasis so as to better ambush creatures and travelers who would never expect to see a frostfallen creature so far south. Animating a Frostfallen Creature A magic-user can create form of frostfallen creature by casting animate dead upon the corpse to be animated and providing an amount of ice of equal weight, plus two blue topazes or turquoises worth at least 100 gp each. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of frostfallen creatures equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Frostfallen creatures count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons and zombies that can be created using animate dead. Creating a Frostfallen Creature ""Frostfallen creature"" is an acquired template that can be added to corporeal creature , referred to hereafter as the base creature. A frostfallen creature uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: As base creature + 1. Alignment: Always neutral evil.

It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: The natural armor bonus improves by +4. Hit Dice: A frostfallen creature drops HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they had 1 racial HD. A skeleton uses its Charisma modifier  to determine bonus hit points. Defensive Abilities: Frostfallen creatures gain DR 5/ bludgeoning . They are immune to cold. Weaknesses: Frostfallen creatures gain vulnerability to fire. Speed: A winged frostfallen creature's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, its fly speed is unchanged. Retain all other movement types. Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the frostfallen creature's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. Special Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all of the base creature's special attacks and also gains the following. Cold : A frostfallen creature's body generates intense cold, dealing an amount of cold damage with its touch determined by its Hit Dice. Creatures attacking a frostfallen creature with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. Frostfallen Creature Hit Dice Cold Damage 1-5 1d6 6-10 2d6 11-15 3d6 16+ 4d6 Abilities: A frostfallen creature's Strength increases by +2 and its Charisma by +6.

Fuath,1,fey,waters,This waterslogged gremlin has lobster claws for hands and an almost canine face with webbed ears.,"Drowners of sailors and sinkers of ships, a fuath  is a wicked gremlin found in the sea. It climbs aboard ships in the dead of night to sever ropes, bore holes in barrels, soil provisions, and murder hapless crew it puts to sleep or catches alone. It delights in drowning creatures by surrounding them with magically thickened waters, cackling with wicked glee as its victims claw desperately for the air only inches from their mouths. A fuath wears seaweed, shells, and coral like other creatures wear armor, clothes, and jewelry. Its body is protected by a hard, hunchbacked carapace. It stands less than 2 feet tall and weighs 12 to 15 pounds. Fuaths don't share a common language with other types of gremlins, though they can pantomime to each other fairly effectively. They have a surprising rapport with other sea creatures, even foul-tempered beasts like reefclaws . Small groups of fuaths lair in sea caves or rocky crevices. Larger groups frequently lay claim to whole sections of ruined ships. Their lairs usually include several trained guard animals. Fuaths prefer the taste of ""land-meat"" to anything from the sea, and often raid shore and ships to slakes their hunger. They adore sea hags to the point of worship.",400
Fukujin,3,outsider,any,This diminutive humanoid looks like a truly ancient but proud old warrior. A tiny tree branch juts from the top of his head.,"Spiritual guardians of ornamental shrubs and miniature trees, fukujin are highly regarded among Tians as bringers of good fortune and sound wisdom. Fukujins are thought to only come to goodhearted and devoted bonsai gardeners, and since bonsai plants are often only cultivated by astute and aesthetically minded humanoids, the kami are usually of a similar nature, speaking to mortals rarely and always cryptically. Regardless of how much of their coveted knowledge they impart upon favored mortals, however, fukujins always bring with them a sense of hope and good luck, and almost all within close proximity of the kami feel an instant sense of relief. Fukujins resemble humanoids with tree branches protruding from their bodies, most often their heads, and some fukujins possess leafy hair or treelike limbs. A fukujin in its physical form is only as tall as its bonsai ward-usually only a foot or two-and weighs less than 30 pounds. Ecology While msee the art of bonsai gardening as humanoids' attempts at controlling or forming nature, fukujins ref lect the practice's virtues of patience and nurturing. Fukujins maintain that a moment of patience and study can reveal multitudes more than years of trial and error, and the diminutive beings spread this knowledge wherever they go. While kami do not reproduce in typical sense, fukujins are known to sow seeds of bonsai plants in the wake of their footsteps, further delighting communities that appreciate such flora. Though assignment of kami remains up to the mysterious will of the gods, fukujins do their part in creating numerous hosts for these spirits. The health and strength of the tree branch protruding from a fukujin's head is often said to be a good indicator of the skill of the warded bonsai tree's caretaker. While the aesthetic values of bonsai trees are often completely subjective, the kami spirits are evidence that there is perhaps a series of core doctrines bonsai farmers should adhere to when taking care of their plants-ideals that a gardener can strive toward to ensure he achieves success in his maintenance of the small tree. A poorly trimmed bonsai plant may sicken the spirit for a time, for instance, while expert grafting can result in a strong or knowledgeable kami. In most cases, however, a kami will almost always leave its ward if a bonsai gardener neglects the plant long enough or effectively ruins the effort, for though fukujins are patient, they have little tolerance for the virtues of negligence and wastefulness. While nearly all fukujins are calm, collected, and patient spirits, the beings are by no means all the same, as their physical appearances, predispositions, and demeanors are just as often reflections of the particular bonsai plant that they watch over. Fukujins who reside within the hearts of deciduous trees, for example, tend to be of lighter color as well as more airy and spirited than the hardy and resilient fukujins of coniferous shrubs, who take on a red, earthy hue. Plant type can also hint at particular magical qualities the spirit might have-white-trunked trees tend to attract gaunter, more fatalistic individuals, while plants with brown or ebon bark inspire kami that are more attuned to the energies and mysteries of magic. The tree branch that sticks out of a fukujin's head while the spirit is in its physical form is often of the same variety as the bonsai tree that the kami protects, though exceptions have been known to exist among particularly dual-natured spirits. Habitat & Society Since their wards are by nature the direct result of humanoid intervention, fukujins are naturally social creatures, and most seek to assist their humanoid partners in not only cultivating beautiful plants, but in all spheres of life. Mbonsai gardeners are often content to live in a permanent home, establish a family, and live a life of tranquility, and fukujins happily provide all manner of advice regarding these domestic issues. In other instances, however, fukujins have been known to travel alongside particularly adventurous cultivators, humanoids who keep the shrubbery and kami spirit in safe and comfortable packs or pouches and consult them for wisdom in circumstances both dire and unusual. The miniature kami's insights and good luck prove as useful in the heat of battle as in the hearthstone, and so humanoids from nearly all walks of life seek the favor of these beings. Bonsai trees are delicate plants and their kami ref lect this fragility. What they lack in physical defenses, however, fukujins make up for in grace and keen insight, using their natural acumen to avoid and deter hazards before they're even encountered. Some might mistakenly see this expert passiveness as a manifestation of fukujins' philanthropic ideals and good intentions, but more often than not their flightiness is simply what they deem to be the wisest course of action. In situations where violence is inevitable, fukujins seek the aid of stronger individuals to help protect them, true to the tradition of their wards' reliance on humanoid intervention and maintenance. Rather than view this reliance on humanoids as a weakness, however, most fukujins accept it as part of a long-lasting transaction between the two forces, each providing unique benefits to the other throughout the relationship. To bolster this partnership, fukujins harness healing powers as well as the strength of their insight, ensuring that their caretakers remain healthy and able to protect the kami and their wards. While they almost always possess pertinent and useful advice, fukujins are known for being reserved under most circumstances, sharing what knowledge they have only when it is absolutely necessary, and they never share wisdom superfluously. Fukujins are normally individualistic and solitary like the plants they watch over, and when they interact with one another they usually do so telepathically. What people often perceive as the luck of fukujins is often merely the result of wise advice garnered from the spirits, though when asked if the kami really are bringers of fortune, fukujins are known to remain even more tight-lipped than usual. Occasionally one might encounter a fukujin in the wild, in lands far from the societies and plants where they commonly make their homes. In such cases, these miniature kami often claim shrubs, young plants, and even whimiscal-looking mushrooms as their wards, grooming nearby groves and glades into quiet meditation gardens or into artistic shapes, inviting visitors to rest and reflect.",800
Fungal Crawler,3,aberration,underground,This giant fanged cricket is caked in pungent fungal growths and topped with a mushroom-like cap.,"Fungal crawlers are a perverse fusion of animal and plant. Over thousands of years, they have prospered and spread beneath the world, dominating the wildest depths of these underground regions. Like hyenas, fungal crawlers are top-tier scavengers. They are efficient hunters, but just as often feed on found carrion or take meals from other predators. When times are especially lean, fungal crawlers can even survive without food, subsisting on radiation and heat absorbed through the fungal flutes covering their pale, sickly bellies. Thousands of breeds of fungal crawlers exist across the world, varying in appearance and habits, but all share a few common features. They invariably appear as monstrous crickets or locusts fused with fungal growths, often topped with mushroom-like caps. This hybridization makes them adept survivors, and infestations are notoriously difficult to clear out entirely. Their needle-like teeth cannot chew solid food, so most fungal crawlers rely on digestive enzymes injected through their bite to make their meals palatable. Average specimens grow to 30 pounds and 3 feet in length. They reproduce by releasing spores, which remain viable for decades until they contact organic matter and eventually develop into small, pale grubs. Msubterranean civilizations tame fungal crawlers as guard animals, pets, or food. Though simple-minded, they are amicable enough to be trained when well-fed. Fungal crawlers hold no loyalties, though, and often flee or attack their keepers at the slightest provocation. Thanks to the bizarre energies that suffuse their homes, fungal crawlers are incredibly diverse. They have adapted over millennia to fill every environment: flying variants fill subterranean rifts with the deafening drone of their wings, while waters breeds skim across the surfaces of underground lakes, and still others thrive in the fiery chambers and tunnels of volcanic networks.",800
Fungoid,3,plant,temperate or warm marshes,"This tall, stocky and powerful humanoid seems formed of mushroom flesh. Its rough facial features are crudely discernible and its arms end in oversized hands.","Fungoids are man-sized humanoid creatures formed of mushroom flesh and leaves. Coloration varies from brownish-green or brown to dark green mottled with brown splotches. Most weigh about 300 pounds. They are found in all but the coldest of swamps and marshes and delight in attacking creatures that wander too close to their lair. Fungoids are carnivores and consider the flesh of humans, elves, and goblins a delicacy. When food is scarce, fungoids become scavengers and feed on carrion. Fungoids lair in the darkest and most dismal place they can find-the more devoid of light, the better. Typically a lair is ringed with mushrooms of varying colors, shapes and sizes. Such a telltale sign is often the only clue that a fungoid lair is present as the lair itself is normally well-hidden or camouflaged. Woe to a creature that actually wanders close enough to examine the mushrooms; by then the fungoids are likely aware of the interloper's presence and are biding their time before an all-out-attack. Fungoids are nocturnal hunters and often travel up to 5 miles away from their lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried or dragged back to the lair and devoured over several days time. Multiple fungoids are often encountered together on hunting excursions, but they never share their kill. ""Each to their own"" is the unspoken motto among fungoids. Fungoids are straightforward combatants that rush into melee swinging their powerful fists. They pummel their foes relentlessly until they are destroyed or their adversaries are killed. Multiple fungoids sometimes work with one another to bring down powerful foes, but once the fight is over, the fungoids cooperation with one another ends, and it's every creature for itself when assessing and gathering up the kills. Fungoids never retreat and always fight to the death. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Fungus Gargoyle,5,plant,any,"This creature looks like a winged statue, humanoid in shape, carved from molds, funguses, and mushrooms. Its arms and legs end in clawed hands and feet, and its mouth is lined with fangs carved from the same substances its body is.","Fungus gargoyles are thought to be gargoyles that have been transformed into their current state by an evil cult that pays reverence to various demons of slime, ooze, and fungus. These creatures are often found acting as guardians in temples dedicated to such demons. Unlike normal plants, fungus gargoyles do not require food or air , but sometimes eat their fallen enemies simply for the sheer pleasure of doing so . A typical fungus gargoyle stands about 5 or 6 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds. Though its shape can vary, most resemble ugly winged humanoids. Fungus gargoyles typically ambush their prey, standing motionless until their opponent moves close. The fungus gargoyles then leap to the attack, slashing with their claws.

Fungus Leshy,2,plant,swamps or underground,"Mismatched eyes dot this plant creature's thick mushroom cap, while below works an overlarge maw set with pale fungal teeth.","Keepers of cavernous mushroom forests and rotting compost pits deep within the swamps, fungus leshys preside over subterranean growth and the rot that fertilizes new life. Among the most alien and monstrous-looking of all leshys, these tiny rot farmers' frightening appearance has more to do with the asymmetrical eeriness intrinsic to molds and fungi than an outward expression of evil. Like all their kin, fungus leshys vary widely in form, often adopting the colors and shapes of the mushrooms and other large fungi common to the areas they tend. Fungus leshys are spawned from realms of underground wonder or the rotting places of the natural world. They perform an important service in the lands they keep, encouraging the growth of fungi, transporting rotting material to fertilize other plants, and making the most use of growth that has died off. Fungus leshys are most active at night and spend the day in the forms of plump fungi amid their ripest compost heaps or fungal glens. Fungus leshys are 2 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds, their spongy interiors full of hollows and fluffy spores.

Fungus Queen,9,plant,underground,"This eerie creature has the upper body of a beautiful, pale green woman and the lower body of a pulsating mound of fungus.","Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins in the service of Nocticula attempted to invade the Jeharlu, the Abyssal Realm of Cyth-V'sug, demon lord of disease and fungus. They sought to assassinate a powerful witch named Soris Delyn, who had befouled one of Nocticula's favorite mortal temples, hidden below the Chelish city of Vyre, before fleeing to her patron's side. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with the outcome, Soris returned to the Material Plane with the fungus queens seeded them throughout the Inner Sea region to aid in the spread of Cyth-V'sug's cult. The fungus queens have taken to the Material Plane like rot to a carcass, and today hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the foul reaches of the world. They are particularly fond of large cave systems in the reaches of Nar-Voth near the surface, and of the slums of ruined cities in the Worldwound. Styrian Kindler's Account of Ostog the Unslain tells of a particularly harrowing encounter with a fungus queen in the caverns below Devil's Platter east of Sandpoint, and of indications that this was but one of msuch queens dwelling in the region. A particularly dangerous and powerful sect of advanced fungus queens dwells within swampsy reaches of Tanglebriar, commanding groups of vegepygmies grown from the corpses of slain elves-these fungus queens have seceded from the rule of Cyth-V'sug and now serve his rebellious minion Treerazer in the crusade to corrupt and destroy Kyonin. An encounter with a normally nonintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way is sure evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but these monsters are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves as well, particularly attractive humanoids. Those charmed minions they especially favor are given the gift of the fungus queen's embrace, and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those they have infested gain their eternal ire, but it is by succubi that fungus queens are the most enraged. Whether it be a simple territorial conf lict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the sensuous plants abandon their normally subtle approaches of mental control and trickery, and instead bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature limb from limb. Fungus queens take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control. While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territorial boundaries apart from nearby queens, and they take great pains not to ""poach"" from their sisters' harems of charmed and infested pets. Mfungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in ranger, bard, or sorcerer- they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. A typical fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. FUNGOID SIMPLE TEMPLATE  Creatures with the fungoid template appear as they did in life, save that their flesh is pallid and moist, and mushrooms and mold cake their bodies. This template can be applied to living, non-plant creature. A fungoid creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Fye,4,undead,any,"This creature resembles a translucent humanoid whose face is contorted and twisted as if frozen in an eternal scream, though it makes no sound.","When a traumatic event occurs within the vicinity of a temple or other holy place, energy often lingers in the area polluting and contaminating an object or the ground itself.

Fye do not communicate nor reason, they simply exist. Though it is not bound to the area where it was created, a fye rarely moves more than 100 feet or so away from its ""birthplace"". A fye appears as a translucent humanoid about 6 feet tall whose lower torso tapers off around the knees into vaporous nothingness. Its face always has the appearance that the creature is screaming or howling though it never utters sound. A fye usually does not enter combat unless it is directly approached or molested. In combat, a fye uses its cause fear spell-like ability against its closest target, followed in the next round by its feeblemind ability.

Fyr,2,fey,temperate forests or mountains,"This small, goat-headed humanoid has large backward curving horns, goat-like legs, a small bushy tail, and a human torso. Except its arms and hands, thick brown fur covers its entire body. It is heavily adorned with rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other such trinkets.","Fyr are satyr-like creatures that make their homes in the mountains wilds and dense forests in well-secluded places such as caves or caverns or under a covering of thick branches and giant leaves. They are a solitary and nomadic race, rarely staying in one place for much longer than a few months before moving on. Though always on the move, a fyr can acclimate itself to its surroundings very quickly. Most encounters are with a solitary creature or a solitary creature and its animal companions. Fyrs are on good terms with gnomes, druids, treants, elves, and halflings, and often trade goods with them or aid them in times of need. Fyr are master jewelers, and their trinkets and baubles are highly sought after by some of the more civilized races that appreciate fine jewelry. These fey tolerate humans and dwarves and likewise trade with them when they near a human settlement or dwarven stronghold. Fyr dislike orcs, goblins, bugbears, and other goblinoids, and avoid contact with them. Fyrs prefer to avoid combat if possible, but if their homeland or comrades are threatened, they attack. Fyrs use their natural ability to hide themselves in their terrain and attack from surprise. Most of the time a fyr attacks by butting with its horns, but some prefer a ""less animalistic"" form of combat and use weapons in combat. Favored weapons include a small longsword, club, hand axe, and dagger. A fyr does not hesitate to retreat if the tide of battle turns against it and usually employs pass without trace so it can escape without being tracked. If encountered with its animal companions, the fyr directs them in combat against its foes. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",600
Gallows Tree,13,plant,"temperate or warm forests, hills, marshes, or plains","This creature appears as a massive, tall tree with thick branches from which hang several humanoid corpses tightly secured by their necks with greenish-brown ropes. Its canopy is thick and bushy, and its trunk is mottled brown.","Gallows trees are sentient plants that sustain themselves on the internal organs and body fluids of living creatures. They use deception to lure potential prey into range at which time they unleash the gallows tree zombies attached to their branches to kill or capture the prey. While mobile, a gallows tree prefers to remain in one spot for an extended length of time . From this location, it simply waits for prey and then attacks when such beings come into view. Gallows trees do not collect treasure but occasionally such items  are found in the vicinity of a gallows tree. A gallows tree normally stands idle, lowering its zombies to the ground when living prey come within 100 feet of the tree. If a foe comes within 15 feet of the tree itself, it lashes out with its sharpened branches and pummels the creature or attempts to wrap a branch around the foe. A grabbed foe is subjected to additional damage as the gallows tree pummels it with its other branches. Occasionally the tree works in concert with its zombies, grabbing a foe and holding it while its zombies pound it into goop. Slain creatures are dragged close to the tree, sliced open, and their innards devoured by the tree's roots. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",25600

They serve no purpose in life now other than killing or capturing living prey for the gallows tree that created them. These monsters retain small memories of their former lives and these scenes sometimes manifest in the zombie's mind, causing it great anger which it vents on the nearest living creature. Gallows tree zombies appear as humanoid creatures with deathly graygreen skin that feels coarse and rough to the touch. A long, sinewy cord of greenish-brown wraps around the zombie's throat and connects it to the gallows tree. Gallows tree zombies show no spark of life in their eyes, but are not completely mindless. They are not undead even though their name suggests otherwise; therefore, they cannot be turned or rebuked. Gallows tree zombies hang motionless from the tree that created them, being lowered to the ground only when a living creature comes within 100 feet of the gallows tree they are connected to. They are formidable opponents and relentlessly pound their foes with their club-like fists while breathing a cloud of choking spores. The zombies prefer uneven odds that favor them, so ganging up on an individual is the norm in battle.

Gallu-Demon,6,outsider,any,This creature looks like a 9-foot tall faceless black-skinned humanoid with long wicked talons. Its otherwise featureless face has a mouth filled with rows of sharpened teeth. It wears no clothing or armor of kind.,"Gallu-demons are shape-shifting demons of the underworld. They are often employed as soldiers and spies by various demon lords and balors in their abyssal armies. Gallu-demons are quick to anger and hard to control, so companies of these demonic beings are loosely organized at best. Where the gallu-demon excels however, is entering the material planes, disguising itself as a normal humanoid, and abducting a mortal it has befriended, quickly whisking it back to its abyssal lair where it turns said mortal over to its master. Gallu-demons have been known to spend months at a time on the Material Plane just to befriend and eventually abduct a chosen target. Abducted targets are sometimes devoured by a gallu-demon before it has completed its task, but more often than not, an abducted victim is given to the gallu-demon's master who enslaves the victim . A gallu-demon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Its flesh is glossy black and other than a large mouth lined with teeth, it has no facial features, though it does seem to be able to see, hear, and smell normally. Gallu-demons attempt to snatch opponents and transport them to the nether spheres of the underworld, where other demons and undead lie waiting in ambush, eager to consume such hapless victims. The galludemon often uses its shape-altering power to approach unsuspecting victims, or to perform special missions such as escorting mortals out of the underworld to claim another in their stead. It must reveal its true form to employ its improved grab ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400
Galvo,9,magical beast,waters,"This creature is constantly crackling with blue energy, and appears to be composed of dozens of undulating electric eels tightly knotted into a slithering, humanoid shape.","In a sunless trench in the Arcadian oceans, deep siyokoy fleshcrafters created the first galvos to serve as soldiers in their war against the sahuagin and skum. Since those days, galvos have moved beyond their darkened trenches, breeding and expanding into shallower, warmer waters. In recent years, they have begun to come closer to civilizations, preying on coastlines communities. A true horror to look upon, a galvo averages 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds. Ecology Direct sunlight dries out a galvo's hide. This does not harm the galvo in the short term, but it causes discomfort. As a result, galvos prefer to stay deep underwaters during the day and stalk the shadows by docks and riversbanks at night. A galvo can live both in the waters and on land, and frightening stories tell of galvos springing up from the waters to strike at prey both on ships and on beaches. While an electric eel's diet of invertebrates and fish would easily sustain a galvo physically, it would not satisfy the sadistic creature's appetite for terror. Invertebrates and fish accept death too easily; galvos prefer prey that screams. Galvos do not wear armor or wield weapons. They attack with their natural weapons which are augmented with potent electrical charges. Much like the electric eels that form their bodies, galvos focus their energy into concentrated electricity, and discharge it with a touch. Even without their formidable electric powers, galvos are dangerous creatures. The eels that make up their bodies tear at their victims with biting mouths. To attack opponents outside their reach, galvos launch component eels from their swarming bodies. When a galvo kills a target, it feasts as soon as it safely can, usually after bringing the victim back to its underwaters cave lair. The victim is stripped of bulky metal armor and weapons, then subsumed into the galvo's writhing body, which peels apart and engulfs the corpse to swiftly and brutally devour its prey. A galvo discards the bones of its victims from its swarming body as they are picked clean. If the meal is small enough, a galvo can maintain its normal activities while it digests, chewing and tearing apart one meal as it hunts for another. Galvos defend themselves with a greater fervor when digesting, but do not attack as aggressively, as they are not usually in the habit of killing more than they can consume at one time. Despite their propensity to work together during mating seasons, galvos do not actually require other galvos to reproduce. As galvos are composed of eels of both sexes, all eels forming a galvo are attracted to one another during these two months and the creatures appear more tightly wound, reducing their size slightly. Instead, the female component eels lay eggs within the swarm, which are inseminated by the male component eels. When the eggs hatch it appears as though a tiny swarm of eels simply emerges from the larger parent galvo, leading mobservers to incorrectly assume galvos reproduce asexually. There is no sexual interaction between separate galvos. They instead come together in cohabitation, working together to attack prey and feed. Typically each galvo births three to 10 infant tangles during this time. Adult galvo cohabitants care for the entire nest, not caring to keep track of which galvo birthed which tangle. As the mating season ends, the galvos find themselves less interested in one another. They drift apart towards the end of this hormonal phase, and each returns to its own lair. At this time, the infant tangles are expected to leave as well and fend for themselves. Only about half of all galvo infants survive to reach adulthood. When a galvo reaches adulthood, it claims a permanent lair. Ideal lairs are underground caves, although large clearing between rocks and out of direct sunlight is satisfactory. A galvo primarily hunts the area near its lair, specifically the land above, where prey is plentiful and one catch makes a large enough meal to sustain it for several days. The magically enhanced galvo hive mind develops a higher intellectual capacity than individual electric eels ever could, showing a level of intelligence approaching that of a below-average human. Galvos cannot speak, but they learn to understand languages when living among or near creatures that communicate verbally. If their need to cause harm is met and they are provided an waters living space, galvos sometimes even come to be loyal followers of more powerful creatures. This is especially true for siyokoys, who keep large stables of galvos at the ready in their endless fight against the sahuagin and skum. Underwaters, electric eels are irresistibly drawn to galvos out of a mix of familiarity and curiosity. Galvos, for their part, typically tolerate such followers for short periods of time before spurning the pests. There has never been a recorded case of a stray electric eel being absorbed into the swarm, although there have been mcases of galvos tiring of mundane eels' compand cannibalizing these followers. Habitat & Society There is no true galvo society. Galvos sometimes work together, but these alliances often are short and last only through a single hunt and feeding. The strange creatures make exceptions during their two-month mating season, when spawned and fertilized eggs require additional protection in order to survive. Galvos do not use items nor intentionally collect wealth. However, when they consume a victim, galvos indiscriminately eat its belongings during their hasty meal. Whatever gear on the corpse of a victim was too big to be eaten is expelled nearby, most often in the galvo's underwaters lair. Reports tell of undigested gems and other valuables being found in the gutted component eels of a freshly killed galvo. In extremely rare circumstances, traditionally worn wondrous items  caught within component eels sometimes convey their magical effects to the galvo.",6400
Gambado,3,aberration,temperate plains,"A dull white humanoid skull lies on the ground in a tangle of sticks, leaves, and twigs.","A gambado makes its lair in a 6-foot deep pit. It hides its body with rocks, leaves, and anything else in the surrounding area, allowing only its head to be seen. Thus, when viewing a hidden gambado, it appears to be nothing more than a humanoid skull resting on the ground. When living creatures approach the gambado, it strikes. The gambado is a human-sized creature with a cylindrical torso topped by a humanoid skull-like head. Two long arms ending in razor-sharp claws protrude from the body. Its torso ends in three long, single-toed feet. Its body is gray in color and leathery and can be compressed like a spring. This is its primary means of locomotion. By compressing its body, the gambado can spring up or forward. Gambado are solitary creatures by nature, and on the rare occasion that more than one is encountered, each will have its own lair and pit from which it attacks. The pits are usually close together to maximize their attacks on creatures within the area. Any treasure collected by a gambado is stored on its pit floor or in a small and well-hidden hole  in the side of its pit. Gambados speak no known languages, and it is unknown how they communicate among themselves. A gambado springs to attack time a living creature comes within 2 feet of its lair. It attacks relentlessly with its bite and claws, but does not fight to the death. If combat goes against it, it seeks the quickest possible means of escape.

Garden Ooze,2,ooze,"temperate forests, marshes, or urban",What seems to be a mass of diseased fibers growing on a plant suddenly moves and slithers independently from its sickly host.,"A garden ooze is an animate, acidic mass of protoplasmic goo that dwells among foliage and scavenges proteins in the form of carrion or small animals that blunder into its vicinity. Although garden oozes are occasionally found in underground regions near the surface-such as sewers, sinkholes, and shallow caves-these oozes prefer the outdoors. One reason for this is that garden oozes are attracted to large collections of organic material where other tiny creatures might come to scavenge. Quick and cunning hunters when compared to most oozes, garden oozes are particularly dangerous because they readily attack creatures that wander nearby regardless of the creatures' size. Oozes that sense prey moving closer are likely to wait to attack until the potential meal is within reach. The oozes also give chase when prey flees. Garden oozes innately change hue to match the ground underneath them, so they can be hard to spot. When a garden ooze attacks, it lashes out with a whiplike appendage coated with a potent flesh-eating acid. If injured, the ooze releases a disgusting stench that makes it harder to fight off. Further, when one garden ooze attacks, other garden oozes nearby join in, piling on and making escape all but impossible. Fortunately for larger potential prey, most garden oozes are quite small, the largest among them reaching 3 feet in diameter before they split into smaller oozes. These oozes are also known as rat-catcher oozes or compost oozes, and some brave gardeners actually encourage the growth of such oozes in their gardens as a way to combat pests. Once the pests are under control, however, the oozes themselves must be hunted and slain before the garden is safe to tend.",600
Gare Linnorm,15,dragon,cold rivers,"An enormous draconic head rises up atop a massive serpentine neck wider than a galleon's mainmast. Seemingly endless coils break the waters's surface around it, only hinting at the monster's terrifying size, as it opens its steam-shrouded maw with a hiss.","So named for a northern word for ""rivers,"" a gare linnorm's body resembles that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature's head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike mlinnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through waters and ice holes. A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years. Ecology Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins, but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite dwelling in waters, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting through rivers and watersways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects prey above. A gare linnorm's breath weapon is similarly linked to this internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature's serpentine body pass waters through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en route to the linnorm's mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the waters through a series of muscular chambers that turn the waters into a gout of steam hot enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between the inside of the linnorm's mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward and, because of the linnorm's magical nature, achieves an almost solid state, hampering movement throughout its area. In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm's fangs are infused with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist's fire. Meanwhile the poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing the target's ref lexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in. Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwaters creatures don't provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves when such creatures come to the waters's edge to drink or cross. When hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through ice or emerges from the waters. It bites first to poison its prey, then strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it into the waters, where creature affected by the linnorm's poison soon drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring another while others burn within the dragon's steaming breath. After feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riversbed dens to sleep, often for days at a time. Habitat & Society Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm's territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000 square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead, after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lakes or section of rivers. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard until the waters refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it deep in the mud and silt of a riversbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency. Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females producing an egg just once every century. Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface of the waters. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than the giant's entire clan.",51200
Gargantuan Monstrous Sea Wasp,11,vermin,warm waters,"A translucent blue and nearly invisible in waters, this cube-shaped jellyfish has four distinct sides and trails dozens of extremely long tentacles.","Monstrous sea wasps are deadly waters creatures with long, writhing and highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm waters and tend to congregate near coastlines regions or rivers mouths where they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience. A creature stung by a sea wasp that lives to tell about, never forgets its brush with this monstrosity. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.",12800
Gargiya,10,magical beast,warm oceans,"With burning eyes and a snapping maw, this blood-red serpent rises from the oceans's depths. Sweltering heat radiates from its rippling scales.","Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the oceans floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a well-earned nickname-""boiler beasts."" Gargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of slithering through waters like an enormous python, a gargiya stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons. Ecology Legends of the seas say that early in gargiyas' existence, as the oceans floor around them shuddered and stretched, the warmth of the seas' burgeoning volcanoes fascinated the beasts. To the gargiyas, these seismic regions offered a siren call of safety, isolation and-unbeknownst to the animalistic creatures-power. While it's unclear just how it lends gargiyas such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas' primary sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities. Scholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat, they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see sentient creatures-even if they're sailing a mile away-as threats to be met head-on. The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even the slightest sign of unlucky passersby. Apparently, to the gargiyas, who venture near their precious lairs must covet them. Because of gargiyas' aggressiveness, a small subset of oceansic cartographers has devoted itself to recording the locations of their known lairs. These maps, available in msouthern ports' markets, are popular among traders and pirates who wish to skirt fiery confrontation. However, in testament to the cutthroat competition between mport merchants, it's not unheard of for these maps to contain ""mistakes""-oversights built into the guides by their previous owners, hoping to lure rivals to horrific doom, or protect favored shipping lanes. Despite gargiyas' destructive reputations, some Golarion cultures revere their molten cores as a symbol of status and wealth. Taldans, in particular, are drawn to the cores' seductively mysterious glow. The richest Taldan patriarchs often believe owning such a rare treasure-and showing it off, of course-is a worthy life goal. Careless of the risks gargiya hunts entail, these patriarchs sometimes sponsor teams of adventurers to quest for these cores. Most of these expeditions end in bloody and burning tragedy, but to some hardy sea-goers, the potential rewards of glory and riches are too alluring to resist. Habitat & Society Gargiyas mostly live alone near major archipelagos with abundant volcanic activity. They are most numerous in the isolated waters surrounding the Shackles, though scattered sightings have been reported throughout Golarion's warmer seas. There is a significant concentration of gargiyas near the Smoker where magma seeps up from the sea floor, and also talk of a stretch north of Shark Island where gargiya lairs speckle the oceans floor by the dozens. No one knows, however, whether this latter story is true or rather was concocted to deter authorities from the hideouts of buccaneers who roamed the islands before the sahuagin staked their claim there. Gargiyas do not typically share their homes with others of their kind. However, sailors have told stories of defeating a gargiya after a long and brutal struggle only to come face to face with another one-ostensibly coming to its kin's aid. The question of whether these tales are simple exaggerations or evidence of gargiya collaboration has prompted ma fistfight in portside taverns. How well these braggarts fare in such brawls often indicates whether they're capable of the outlandish adventures they so boldly claim. Although tales of collaborating gargiyas are unsettling enough, even more sinister rumors have surfaced from seafarers who dare to brave the Eye of Abendego. There, the tales say, the turbulent seas beneath Golarion's permanent hurricane hide groups of gargiyas whipped into a frenzy by the tempest that followed Aroden's death a century ago. According to legend, these gargiyas roam the entire area of the Eye as predators, ambushing ships and boiling their crews in the oceans's salty waters. It is said that they decorate their volcanic lairs with their victims' bones, hinting that gargiyas possess an intelligence beyond that of mere animals. Unlike mreptilian creatures, gargiyas birth their young live. Scholars agree that, typically, male and female gargiyas come together to breed every decade or so. Afterward, the beasts abandon each other. When the female returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magma-spewing fissure, where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home. Although there is some debate about gargiyas' longevity, scholars believe they typically live around 300 years. Rumors, however, speak of gargiyas that have lived much longer-perhaps even predating modern civilization-but if have encountered such an ancient terror and survived, they have never surfaced to tell the tale.",9600
Gargoyle,4,monstrous humanoid,any,"Seemingly carved from a dark gray stone, this sinister crouching humanoid resembles a horned, winged demon.","Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called ""wings"" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night. The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region's architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle's appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically. One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths-they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the waters subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet . Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastlines regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.",1200

Mmagic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of gargoyles, emulating those creatures' ability to blend in with stone structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles to create stealthy protectors and watchdogs. Mspellcasters construct gargoyle guardians that have special abilities, making them even more capable and vigilant sentinels.

Garipan,10,outsider,any,"Batlike wings stretch behind this stone-faced creature with a wide, wild grin and fierce red eyes. The molten core in the creature's torso glows through rugged cracks in its dark stone skin.","Vicious beings with little memory of who or what they might once have been, garipans know only two things: that they were once evils in service to the legions of Hell, and that they are no longer bound to that infernal hierarchy. With resistant, stony hides; sharp claws; and a flaming core to rival the inferno of Hell, garipans combine some of the worst depravities of devils with the freedom of beings with nothing at all to lose. These hulking, winged creatures often masquerade as gargoyles, but are actually the final state of failed conjurations. If a summoning is cast incorrectly, pulling only a portion of a devil's essence to Golarion, unidentifiable magical environmental conditions combine with the shard of the outsider's being to create a garipan. Garipans are rarely aware of the full details of their previous existence; much in the same way that lesser devils can forget their lives when they ascend to more powerful forms, newly formed garipans are overwhelmed by unfamiliar sensations. Unfettered by conjuring magic, unrestricted by magic that protects against extraplanar intrusion, and free from the threat of banishment back to Hell, garipans experience freedom for the first time, and this freedom most often results in a break from their previous lives. In combat, a garipan uses flight and the fire raging within it to its greatest advantage, swooping overhead with its breath weapon first, then closing in for a full attack with its bite and claws while its breath weapon recharges.",9600

Gashadokuro,13,undead,any,"This massive skeleton appears to be the animated bones of some giant humanoid. As it lumbers forward, the bones and skulls of countless smaller creatures rattle inside its massive rib cage and fall from the intersections of its joints.","Gashadokuros are enormous skeletons that come into being as a result of mass starvation, the countless victims of such a tragedy fusing together into an undead colossus that continues to hunger even in death. Although a gashadokuro may at first appear to be the skeleton of some giant humanoid, the detritus sifting through its joints and its deadly ability to absorb creatures quickly reveal that the animated horror is something far more terrible. A gashadokuro's size depends on the scale of the famine that caused its emergence, with more devastating food shortages resulting in larger gashadokuros. A typical gashadokuro is 30 feet tall and weighs up to 5,000 pounds. Ecology Gashadokuros usually form in the wake of horrible natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or destructive storms that destroy crops and leave thousands without food. As hunger turns into famine and famine turns into death, the spirits of the dying sometimes leave a fragment of their pain and hunger embedded in their physical bodies. When the haunted corpses begin to decompose and sink into the ground, the bones do not fertilize the nearby grubs and plants as would normal bone meal, but instead become the devourers, absorbing countless vermin and showing the first sparks of undead energy as the bone shards and bits of marrow begin to move through the dirt of their own accord. The cursed bones of the starved victims congregate beneath the soil, and when they finally stitch themselves together and take the form of a gashadokuro, the undead monstrosity bursts forth and begins an endless search to satisfy its unearthly hunger. Although its body is composed mostly of bones and other organic material that never fully decomposed, a gashadokuro is far from mindless, and still possesses a flicker of intelligence. The combined intellects of so monce-living creatures weave together into a rudimentary but dark cunning, and the undead colossus uses its feral instincts to hunt living creatures, forever seeking to sate its ineradicable, collective memory of starvation. A gashadokuro's tombstone-sized teeth and jagged claws are more than capable of destroying most foes, but it wields simple tools-such as an unearthed tree trunk used as a club-when it needs some sort of weapon to crush its opponents. In a grisly mockery of human digestion, a gashadokuro may capture a dead victim in its jaws and incorporate the corpse into the innumerable bodies that churn within its massive chest cavity. In a matter of seconds, the corpse begins to turn into bleached, brittle bones, its indigestible possessions falling through the gaps in its skeletal frame as the giant lumbers on. Only when the gashadokuro's rib cage is completely filled with the bones of victims does its terrible hunger subside. But as the creature wanders and small vestiges of its meals tumble slowly from within, a gashadokuro starts to know hunger once again, and it resumes its hunt for new prey. A gashadokuro will hunt and kill anything, its appetite knowing no bounds. Nonetheless, it prefers larger creatures in the hope that such food will end its perpetual craving. Tales tell of ranchers who unknowingly raise their livestock in a gashadokuro-plagued area, awaking to find all of their cattle gone, a trail of prematurely bleached bones leading into the distance their only clue as to their animals' whereabouts. Although the bones cradled within a gashadokoru's torso serve to abate the creature's hunger, the behemoth also uses them as deadly weapons against more formidable prey. In combat, a gashadokuro sprays a wicked blast of fragmented bone shards at its foes, the deadly shrapnel flaying skin from enemies, stripping bark from trees, and punching through plate mail. After it has slaughtered its opponents, the gashadokuro picks up the bloody bodies and consumes them in its gruesome fashion, converting its victims' bones into additional fuel for its deadly attacks. Habitat & Society Gashadokuros can arise from almost terrain, although they are most common in harsh, resource-strapped lands like scorching deserts or icy tundra. However, even urban areas can give rise to one of these predatory horrors if its people succumb to the right mix of hunger and despair. Once formed, a gashadokuro's ability to range knows no bounds, and such terrors often travel hundreds of miles beyond their place of emergence to feed. Despite its ability to understand the common tongue of the starved individuals who make up its bulk, a gashadokuro cannot be bargained with and does not make allies, even among its own kind. Its voracity drives it ever onward, and it knows no distinction between good and evil victims, wreaking havoc wherever it goes with no regard for the target of its endless craving. A gashadokuro's single-minded destructiveness can often unite even the bitterest and most ancient of rivals in tenuous pacts to rid the land of its monstrous presence. Occasionally, evil clerics and powerful necromancers can bend a gashadokuro to their will and, if successful, unleash the monster as a scourge against their enemies. Few risk such an attempt, however, as most evil spellcasters know that should they lose control over such a powerful minion, the consequences would be dire. The intentional creation of a gashadokuro is almost unheard of, as the drawn-out suffering and deprivation required to create such mass starvation require time and a concerted effort few can muster. However, there have been instances of particularly heinous rulers who have sought the power of such an undead goliath, starving their people to death in order to use the ensuing monster as a weapon in war or for some other detestable purpose. More often, though, cruel warlords and merciless generals who wish to create such a horrific beast take the opposite route and attempt to cut off their enemies' access to food, effectively striking the targeted nations twice when the famished citizens starve, then rise from the earth as gashadokuros eager to destroy those whom they may have once called allies and kin.",25600
Gelatinous Cube,3,ooze,underground,"Bits of broken weapons, coins, and a partially digested skeleton are visible inside this quivering cube of slime.","One of the dungeon's most unusual and specialized predators, gelatinous cubes spend their existence mindlessly roaming dungeon halls and dark caverns, swallowing up organic material such as plants, refuse, carrion, and even living creatures. Materials the cube cannot digest, such as metal and stone, can eventually fill up the creature's mass with such detritus, and at times the creature may excrete some of this material out of its body. Often the treasure and possessions of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube, leaving a ghostly impression of their material remains. Sages believe these creatures evolved as a specialized advancement of gray oozes. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as protectors of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping the immense creatures in massive metal crates and transporting them through either slave power or magic to their final guard posts. They make particularly efficient waste disposal mechanisims as well-a tribe that can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or other area that it cannot climb out of can use it as a midden or even a deadly trap, depending only on the ingenuity of the creatures who caught it. Gelatinous cubes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh upward of 15,000 pounds, though subterranean explorers report larger specimens trawling the deepest caves and corridors. In locations with plentiful sources of food, gelatinous cubes can exist for hundreds of years, if not thousands. However, if denied organic material for more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins shrinking. Eventually this stresses its walls and the creature leaks rapidly evaporating slimy liquid until its body collapses and disappears completely.",800

Two large recesses on its surface function as eyes and its moth stretches wide.","Geons are natives of the Elemental Plane of Earth. They are sometimes summoned by powerful spellcasters to do their bidding, usually acting as protectors or guardians. Some, however, find their way to the Material Plane on their own when a portal between the two planes opens. On the Material Plane, geons are found in mountains, barren hills, and other rocky environments. Most geons have been given a task by an earth god and live to faithfully carry out that task. A geon's voice is low and rumbling, sounding like stones grinding together whenever the creature speaks. Geons shun combat if possible, using their special abilities to hide in the surrounding earth. If the geon has a task and that task is threatened, the guardian does not hesitate to enter combat or use its abilities to animate boulders to attack its foes and create walls of stone to contain them.

Geryon often leaves his fortress to wander the city, but rarely ever journeys beyond the city's gates. The city is a large, dark place filled with all manner of filth, waste, and creatures. Geryon is one of the most powerful arch-devils  and enjoys displaying his physical prowess to who would watch, often destroying pit fiends or minor dukes for sheer pleasure and entertainment. While he is weaker than other arch-devils , he has allied himself with Mephistopheles and as such is feared by many.

Layers of skin continually flakes off of the monster's parched, exposed flesh, which is a sickly, pale yellow. The average gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Gholdakos are nearly always guardians of some special relic or tomb in Ghol-Gan ruins, having been ordered to protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away from their posts, though being caught by the undead giant almost always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be tricksters.

Ghorazagh,13,aberration,underground,"With an armored spherical body, numerous tentacular legs, and a multi-eyed visage, this creature is truly hideous.","Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-f loat like tumorous specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched vermin of those horrid places.

While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are incapable of digesting blood. Their digestive systems process flesh, bone, and all other organic material, filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed internally with mucus and other strange fluids to form a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh hives are constructed entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance.

Ghost,7,undead,any,"This spectral, horrifying figure glides silently through the air, passing through solid objects as if they didn't exist.","When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil-even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife. More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue-there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover-after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost's abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts. When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal ""copies"" of items that it particularly valued in life . The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but such attack deals only half as much damage  unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality. The original items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place . Creating a Ghost ""Ghost"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6. A ghost retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Armor Class: A ghost gains a def lection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier. It loses the base creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or ghost touch items. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel resistance +4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain the rejuvenation ability. Rejuvenation : In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the ""destroyed"" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM. Speed: Ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet , unless the base creature has a higher fly speed. Melee and Ranged Attacks: A ghost loses all of the base creature's attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can wield ghost touch weapons as a ghost. Special Attacks: A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a ghost gains one ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR . The save DC against a ghost's special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Additional ghost abilities beyond these can be designed at the GM's discretion. Corrupting Gaze : The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage . Corrupting Touch : All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inf licts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inf licted. Draining Touch : The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 points from one ability score it selects on a hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard ghostly touch attack. Frightful Moan : The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours. Malevolence : The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell , except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours. Telekinesis : The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds . Abilities: Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a ghost has no Strength or Constitution score. Skills: Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge , Knowledge , Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.",3200

Ghost-faced orcs are similar in every way to their common cousins- filthy, smelly, aggressive and thoroughly cruel. Their hair is ranges from black to slate grey to shock white. Their equipment is ill kempt and crudely made, leaving most to forage for better gear amongst their victims. Ghostfaces are seldom seen above ground except on moonless nights. Ghost-faced orcs are proficient with all simple weapons. Most are warriors, fighters or barbarians and favor greataxes and longspears to other weapon. They on occasion carry shortbows for hunting or ambushes. Ghost-Faced Orc Society Ghost-faced orcs differ little from their kin with the exception that a larger portion of their population are clerics in service of Grotaag. As such these battle priests hold a revered place in society. The priesthood is referred to as the Ghost Face Cabal which is made up of the highest level clerics amongst the tribe. The cabals outfit themselves and their most powerful slayers with enchanted weapons, armor and potions. Ghost-Faced Orc Characters Ghost-faced Orc leaders tend to be clerics of Grotaag or powerful barbarian champions. Clerics have access to two of the following domains: Chaotic, Evil, Trickery, and War. +6 Strength, +2 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, -6 Charisma. Blood orcs are brutal and savage. Darkvision: Ghost-faced orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Special Qualities: ferocity, invisible in shadows , light sensitivity Languages: Ghost-faced orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc.

Ghoul,1,undead,land,"This humanoid creature has long, sharp teeth, and its pallid flesh is stretched tightly over its starved frame.","Ghouls are undead that haunt graveyards and eat corpses. Legends hold that the first ghouls were either cannibalistic humans whose unnatural hunger dragged them back from death or humans who in life fed on the rotting remains of their kin and died  from the foul disease-the true source of these undead scavengers is unclear. Ghouls lurk on the edges of civilization  where they can find ample supplies of their favorite food. Though they prefer rotting bodies and often bury their victims for a while to improve their taste, they eat fresh kills if they are hungry enough. Though most surface ghouls live primitively, rumors speak of ghoul cities deep underground led by priests who worship ancient cruel gods or strange demon lords of hunger. These ""civilized"" ghouls are no less horrific in their eating habits, and in fact the concept of a welllaid ghoul banquet table is perhaps even more horrifying than the concept of taking a meal fresh from the coffin.

Ghul,5,undead,warm deserts,"Draped in fine dark robes, this undead creature's body seems to be made of equal parts bone, leathery flesh, and blood-red smoke.","Ghuls are undead jann whose eternal existence was twisted by fate and wrought through the displeasure of Ahriman, Lord of the Divs. As if the curse of undeath and ravenous hunger were not enough, these once-majestic creatures now bear donkey hooves as feet. Despite their horrific undead appearance, this feature shames them the most, and they hide their feet from view. Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and other places of the dead hoping to feed on corpses. They also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as they enjoy the taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality, believing innocence and youth taste more delicious than the barely palatable flesh of the bitter and old. Sometimes a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form, keeping a safe distance until the ceremony, whereupon it changes into its true form to attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as delicious as innocence to a ghul. While not directly affected by sunlight, ghuls despise its presence and only move about during the day if forced to by necessity. They primarily hunt at night, sometimes straying far from their graveyard lairs and burial caves in search of fresh prey to sate their hunger. The longer a ghul goes without feeding, the more ferocious and primal the creature becomes. A well-sated ghul organizes with others of its kind and lesser undead, tormenting nearby towns and settlements. A ghul involved with this level of organization often has a scattered set of lairs throughout the deserts. These allow the ghul to strike far from its home lair and hide again without having to travel during the blistering daylight sun. When a ghul goes for too long without feeding, it becomes increasingly feral and violent- its statistics don't change, but it grows less concerned with fleeing combat, even when it is obviously outmatched.

Giant Archerfish,1,animal,temperate waters,This silver fish is 3 feet long with vertical black stripes.,"Giant archerfish are peaceful, surface-dwelling waters animals that shoot a powerful stream of waters at land- or airborne creatures in an attempt to fell it into the giant archer's body of waters where the fish quickly swims in and devours it. These creatures exist mainly on a diet of insects and small animals such as birds, shrimp, worms, and snails though some of the larger ones occasionally target small humanoids as prey. Giant archerfish are typically solitary creatures and rarely travel in schools. Schools of these fish, when encountered, do not work in concert with one another; every fish is on its own. Giant archerfish are three feet long and have silver-colored bodies with vertical black stripes that begin just behind the head and fade as they near the tail. Their eyes are either cloudy blue or silver and its fins are slightly darker than its body. Some species of giant archerfish are yellowishgray with dark-colored eyes, but all have the vertical black stripes. Giant archerfish can grow to be five feet long.

Two long segmented antennae jut from its head.,"Assassin bugs are predatory insects that feed on the blood and tissue of living creatures. Actively hunting or passively waiting for its prey, an assassin bug is a formidable killing machine that has few enemies. Assassin bugs are communal creatures and nests of up to 20 or so are not unheard of. Most nests contain at least one female of mating age and during mating season the female deposits a sticky clutch of eggs  in cracks or crevices in the forests floor. The eggs hatch within two weeks and newborn assassin bugs look exactly like their adult counterparts . An assassin bug goes through several growth stages before finally reaching adult stage within one year. An assassin bug stands 5 feet tall. Its body is segmented and almost always dull brownish black . Its front curved legs  are black and covered in tiny hairs that aid it in climbing as well as capturing its prey. An assassin bug has two pairs of wings that it keeps folded against its back when not using them to fly. Depending on the disposition of the assassin bug, it is either an opportunistic ambush hunter that lies in wait for its prey to come close, or it actively seeks out its food. Regardless, when a victim is within range, the assassin bug leaps to the attack, attempting to grapple and pins its prey so it can inject it with its organ-dissolving saliva. A victim that dies is kept in the assassin bug's lair for several weeks and feasted upon by it and others in the nest, each taking a turn drinking the liquefied internals of the victim.

Giant Beheaded,2,undead,any,"This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.","Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how mcan be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in way and applied to of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching : A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type  chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning : This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn  special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing : This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming : Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chillsing scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming skull's Cha modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same beheaded's scream for 24 hours.",600

Giant Blister Beetle,1,vermin,warm forests,"A large beetle with a slick, dark green carapace approaches. The creature snaps its large serrated mandibles, black in color, together as it moves toward you.","Blister beetles are nocturnal scavengers found in forests or underground. They are non-aggressive creatures, but have voracious appetites and will, if food is scarce, attack just about anything that comes close to them. Their favored meal, however, is bees; both giant and normal. Their immunity to poison aids grants them protection from the deadly sting of giant bees . A cluster of beetles waits near an area frequented by bees and then spring to attack when a bee lands on a flower or plant. Another favored meal is grasshoppers. Blister beetles ambush these large insects and drag the prey back to their lair. Blister beetles reproduce and mature rapidly. The female deposits a group of 2d4 eggs in a hole in the nest. The male then sprays the eggs with its blister spray. Within three days the eggs burst open with an audible pop and out swarm the young blister beetles. Young reach maturity in about three weeks. When attacked, a blister beetle releases a foul stream of black oily liquid that irritates the skin of living creature it hits. Afterwards, it moves to combat and strikes with its mandibles.

Bog turtles are diurnal creatures and spend the nighttime hours sleeping in their lairs. Giant bog turtles are solitary creatures; rarely is more than one ever encountered. Mating season is the only time more than one is encountered and it is short, one month during the spring. The female lays a clutch consisting of 1d3+3 eggs. The eggs are buried in swamps mud and hidden from predators and those that would steal them. The female stays near the eggs at all times except when eating or hunting. Gestation lasts about 3 months before the eggs hatch. Newborn bog turtles grow rapidly and are self-sufficient within one year. Young reach maturity around four years of age. A giant bog turtle is about 20 feet long. Younger bog turtles have light stripes ringing their shell. As they age, the stripes slowly fade. A giant bog turtle lies silently, drawn into its shell waiting for prey to pass near. At a distance greater than 30 feet, its shell resembles a large mound of earth or foliage and is often mistaken for such. Once prey moves within range, the giant bog turtle snaps its head out and attempts to swallow a foe. In deeper waters, it opens its mouth and draws in waters, plants, rocks, and pulls swimmers close enough so it can use its bite and attempt to swallow the creature.

They are nocturnal hunters that enjoy swooping down on unsuspecting prey, scooping it up, and flying back to their nest to dine on the meal. Giant falcons prey on animals such as birds , reptiles, and rodents. Prized meals include snakes , dire rats, and small humanoids. Prey is captured and carried to the nest, where it is devoured later or fed to the young. Mating season for giant falcons varies, but typically occurs during the summer months.

Most giant falcons have a light-colored chest with white predominant on the neck and throat and slowly fading as it reaches the abdomen. Giant falcons are generally solitary hunters, though excursions consisting of up to four of these creatures are not unheard of. Such hunting teams communicate with each other, relaying their position as well as the position of their target through vocalizations consisting of loud squawks and cries. A giant falcon attacks by swooping down on its foe and raking with its talons and stabbing with its beak. Training a Giant Falcon A giant falcon must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant falcon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly giant falcon requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a giant falcon requires an exotic saddle. A giant falcon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check.

They have strong hind legs with powerful tendons that allow them to leap incredible distances with ease. A giant flea is about a foot long, with an oval, flattened body. This shape makes it easy for a giant flea to move in and among the hairs of large mammals. When lacking mammals large enough for them to feed on, giant fleas live in swarms of up to twenty individuals. These swarms wander at random, seeking prey large enough to sate their appetites. Female giant fleas lay their eggs in warm areas  and leave them to hatch and fend for themselves. The female lays a clutch of up to 2d10 eggs, half of which never hatch. The larvae hatch in two weeks, and resemble hairy maggots; they are effectively helpless . They mature into adult giant fleas in 1d6 months, and leap away to join or form a colony.

Local legends call this plant names like ""mancatcher,"" ""snapperjaw plant,"" ""dragonleaf plant,"" ""cowbiter,"" and ""green gulper,"" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap. As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe. While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more. As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites , consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.

Workers spend their time pulling nectar from flowers and carrying it to the nest where they feed the young, the queen, and the other hornets. They are also the hornets involved in defending the nest and queen from attack. When aggressors are detected within 100 feet of the nest, the workers fly out and patrol the area. Creatures that move within 20 feet are attacked. The queen's sole purpose is to lay eggs that ultimately hatch and grow into new hornets. She has no stinger and does not attack-workers kill most aggressors long before they reach the queen. Giant hornet builds its nest high above the ground in much the same way a standard wasp does. A giant hornet's nest has a curved flare at the top. Giant hornets attack by biting their foes, only relying on its stinger when threatened. During combat, it releases a pheromone that agitates all other giant hornets in the area, making them more aggressive. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Giant Horsefly,3,vermin,temperate or warm forests or marshes,"This creature looks like an 8-foot long hairy, black fly.","Giant horseflies are aggressive relatives of the smaller horsefly and generally frequent the same type of habitat. Their lairs are always built near a source of waters and the lair itself is kept damp by waters from the surrounding ground. A typical nest contains one female and up to 20 males. One male is taken as a mate and during the spring or fall months, the female lays a clutch of 5-8 eggs. During warmer months or when the temperature is extremely high, a flurry of activity can be noticed around the nest as the horseflies prepare for the colder months and the female prepares to lay her eggs. Young hatch within a few weeks and resemble giant larvae with segmented bodies. Each segment of the larvae's body has small protuberances that aid in movement. Giant horseflies sustain themselves on a diet of nectar, pollen, and blood. Their hunting territory typically covers a range of several square miles around their nest. Blooded targets usually involve animals, livestock, and the occasional humanoid. Giant horseflies look like large, black hairy flies. Their bodies are thick and their multifaceted eyes are black and dark gold. Wings are translucent and their legs are long, bristly and jet black. Females have a slightly longer mouth tube than males. Giant horseflies attack by delivering a painful bite to their opponent. If hunting, a giant horsefly attempts to grapple its foe and drain its blood. Slain prey is left to rot; the giant horsefly only drinks its blood, it does not eat its remains. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800

The giant mantis, a master of hiding in dense undergrowth, is almost unnaturally patient as it lies in wait, striking with unsettling speed as unsuspecting meals wander by. In msavage societies, the giant mantis is particularly feared-in regions where these vermin are common, they are often regarded as messengers of death sent to the world by angry gods. Their swift speed, alien appearance, and near-invisibility in forests give rise to mlegends- that the giant mantis can become invisible, that it can smell fear, and that the souls of those who it slays and eats are digested and kept from moving on to the afterlife. While the giant mantis is nothing more than an efficient and deadly vermin, the numerous legends and whispers regarding its supposed powers and alien intellect have inspired some spellcasters to work such features into their constructs as a way to make them even more fearsome. There are even stories of entire societies of assassins who worship an immense mantis as a god, and who have taken to heart the mantis's style of murderous ambush, fighting with twin serrated rapiers. The giant mantis presented here stands 7 feet tall and 15 feet long, and weighs 650 pounds. Larger giant mantises exist in the deepest, darkest forests of the world, where they might prey upon things as mighty as giants or dragons.

Giant pikes, like their smaller counterparts, are voracious and often attack prey much larger than themselves. Their diet consists mainly of soft-finned fish, trout, perch, frogs, mice, ducks, birds, and small humanoids. Larger prey includes humanoids, other giant fish, deer, and sheep or goats. Giant pikes have no qualms about eating those of their own kind, especially when food is scarce. The giant pike averages about nine feet long and can grow to a length of 20 feet. Its coloration varies from dark green to brown and its body is covered in lighter colored spots. It has a single dorsal fin and a white or cream-colored underbelly. The giant pike hides in weeds, behind rocks, or some other such cover, waiting for potential prey to wander nearby.

Giant scorpions weigh between 2,000 and 6,000 pounds. Giant scorpions normally feed on other giant vermin, as well as large mammals that they paralyze with their venom, but they will attack and eat living creature that ventures too close.

Giant scorpions engage in complex courtship rituals when they mate, grasping each other's pincers, arching their tails, and performing a circular ""dance."" Soon after mating, the male usually retreats to avoid being cannibalized by the female. Female scorpions do not lay eggs; they give birth to live young in broods of a dozen or so. The mother carries her brood on her back until the young are old enough to fend for themselves and hunt their own prey. Giant scorpions live in underground burrows, either as solitary hunters or in small colonies, and will sometimes take up residence in man-made ruins or dungeons if food is plentiful.

Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds.

Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean. Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or deserts-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the skies, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watersing holes, rivers, and coastlines cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or waters so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.",4800
Giant Tarantula,8,vermin,forests,"A massive tarantula covered in bristly hairs strides forward with deliberate steps, its eight eyes scanning for prey.","A tarantula doesn't use a web to ensnare prey, though it may spin a trip wire to signal an alert when something approaches its burrow. These spiders grab with their appendages, inject paralyzing venom, and dispatch their unfortunate victims with their fangs. They also secrete digestive enzymes to liquefy their victims' bodies so that they can suck them up through their straw-like mouth openings. After a large meal, the tarantula may not need to eat for a month.",4800
Giant Tick,1,vermin,temperate forests,Giant ticks appear as 3-foot long ticks. They are otherwise similar to normal ticks.,"Giant ticks attack by dropping on their prey from above and stabbing with a hollow mouth tube.

It swims aggressively towards anything that draws too near.,"The giant tiger barb is peach with black-striped gills that resemble the stripes of a tiger.

Giant Toad,2,animal,"temperate forests, plains, or swamps",Stubby warts dot the skin of this horse-sized brown toad. Its throat bulges and ripples as though about to croak.,"Most giant toads live in dryer areas after maturing, returning to the waters only to mate and give birth. Giant toad companions are identical to giant frog companions , save that they lack the frog's tongue and pull abilities. Instead, they gain the poison skin ability at 4th level.",600
Giant Tuatara,4,animal,temperate plains or hills,"This reptile has a beak like upper jaw, a long narrow body and is covered in hard scales and short spines running along its back.","This burrowing reptile has a sharp beak designed to crack and tear through the carapace or scaled hide of its prey. A tuatara's diet consists of anything it can find: plants, insects, and adventurers. Prey that is not devoured immediately is dragged back to its lair and either fed to the young. Their slow metabolism allows them to go long periods of time without eating so food is generally not kept or saved. In times when food is scarce, tuataras often eat their own kind. They generally bury their eggs in a burrow with females producing 1d0+4 eggs per litter during the warmer months of the year. Females mate once about every four or five years, and rarely before 20 years of age . Mating occurs in the early spring months and incubation lasts 13 to 15 months with young being born the following summer. Young are helpless and depend solely on their mother for survival for the first few months of their life. Tuataras live to be about 100 years old. A giant tuatara is about ten feet long and weighs close to 400 pounds. Its color ranges from gray or olive to dull red. It lacks ears but has two small openings on either side of its head that seem to function as such. On top of its head is a ""third eye""  that helps the tuatara in regulating its body temperature. Males have a noticeable crest down the center of its neck and back; females have the same crest, but it is much less pronounced. Tuataras stalk their prey at night, having excellent vision in low light and a keen sense of smell. They generally avoid contact with creatures larger than themselves if they can help it. When threatened, a tuatara inflates its body, raises and flares its crest, and darkens the scales between its shoulders and neck. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Giant Vulture,4,animal,warm plains or hills,A wickedly hooked beak and an immense bald head draw attention from this enormous scavenger's vast wingspan.,"Larger even than condors, giant vultures dwell only in regions where carrion is both large and plentiful, such as the primeval wildernesses where megafauna roam. They also flock to regions torn by war, feasting on the dead with no concern for allegiance or race. Giant vultures rarely wait for wounded creatures to finish dying before they feed, and are much braver than most wild animals. A giant vulture, for example, wouldn't think twice about swooping down on a heavily armored column of soldiers just to snatch up a few wounded stragglers from the end of the line. A giant vulture stands more than 13 feet tall, has a wingspan of over 30 feet, and weighs 500 to 600 pounds.

Giant Wasp,3,vermin,temperate forests,This horse-sized wasp is covered in yellow and black vertical stripes-its stinger is the size of a sword and drips with venom.,"Giant wasps nearly always form nests, though not like their much smaller cousins. Each nest functions with one leader , a few workers, and several soldiers. The workers and the queen produce offspring while the soldiers protect the nest and hunt for food. Giant wasp nests are typically found in caves, abandoned houses, or complex large enough to fit a dozen 10-foottall insects. Giant wasps attack when hungry or threatened, stinging their prey to death. They take dead or incapacitated opponents back to their lairs as food for their unhatched young-the experience of lying in a wasp nest, paralyzed while its grubs feed, is one of nature's cruelest inventions. Even when part of a nest, giant wasps tend toward solitary hunting, and it's rare to see more than one at a time.",800
Giant waters Beetle,3,vermin,freshwaters waters,This giant beetle has a cylindrical and hydrodynamic body that tapers into a pointed tail section. Its wing covers and carapace are brownish-black and its legs are dull yellow. A silver stripe runs along its dorsal side.,"These highly aggressive beetles make their home in deep freshwaters, such as rivers, lakes, pools, and seas and can be found in climate, stretching from the warmest to the coldest. Giant waters beetles are predators and sustain themselves on fish and other waters animals. They spend most of their lives in the waters, rarely coming on land. If encountered on land, a giant waters beetle will never be more than 30 feet from source of waters. They are diurnal creatures and hunt during the day, diving with blinding speed when they spot a potential meal in the waters. When not actively hunting, they simply drift along with the current. Giant waters beetles lair on the bottoms of lakes, pools, and seas. If a colony is found, there will be at least 1 female giant waters beetle and 2d4 eggs. Giant waters beetle eggs are brownish with flecks of green. Eggs hatch within three weeks after the female deposits them Giant waters beetles reach full maturity in six to eight weeks. When hunting, these creatures prefer to attack by ambushing their prey from above. They drift along and then dive at the target with blinding speed . Prey is bitten by the giant waters beetle's oversized mandibles. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Giant Whiptail Centipede,3,vermin,temperate or warm forests or underground,"An elephantine centipede scurries about, its double tail lashing angrily behind it.","Whiptail centipedes are carrion eaters, though corpses large enough to satiate them are a rarity.

Giant Yellowjacket,4,vermin,temperate or warm land,The massive winged insect has a pattern of black and yellow markings on its body and a wicked-looking stinger at the tip of its thorax.,"be distinguished from giant hornets by the yellow markings on their thorax and abdomen. Giant yellowjackets spend their days suckling nectar from flowers and fruit juices from plants. When hunting for food to feed the young, they seek out sources of carrion or animal tissue. Living prey is attacked and stung to death and then cut into pieces by the giant yellowjacket's sharp mandibles and carried piece by piece back to the nest. Giant yellowjackets generally build their nests high above ground in rocky outcroppings or forestsed areas. Some giant yellowjackets prefer to build their nests underground, constructing them in abandoned giant snake holes. Giant yellowjackets are 8 feet long with alternating bands of black and yellow on their thorax and abdomen. Workers generally have thicker black bands than the queen or soldiers. The yellowjacket's stinger is slightly curved and barbed and their mandibles are well-formed and developed, allowing them to chew their food. Giant yellowjackets attack by biting their foes. Though it has a poisonous stinger, it usually conducts combat with its bite attack, unless threatened by or confronting a particularly powerful opponent. In such cases, the giant yellowjacket brings its stinger to bear and repeatedly stings its foes until they are dead. If attacked, a giant yellowjacket releases a pheromone that agitates all others of its kind, making them deadlier and more aggressive. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Gibbering Mouther,5,aberration,underground,"This horrid mass of eyes, mouths, and formless flesh stares in all directions, its countless maws yammering ceaselessly.","Disgusting, loathsome, and hungry-these are the only words that properly describe the gibbering mouther. A foul beast that lurks in underground caves, sewers, and nightmares, mouthers have no societal, ecological or religious significance other than their ability to drive those that listen to them mad. Some scholars believe that gibbering mouthers are a lesser variant of the much more dangerous shoggoth, while others theorize they are a punishment by some powerful being or deity inf licted on those who have offended it.",1600
Gigas Clam,11,magical beast,oceans,"This monstrous clam's conjoined shells open wide enough to swallow a horse. Inside, two tubular siphons flank the thing's innards, which resemble a fleshy, vaguely humanoid woman, save that instead of a face, it has a singular massive maw filled with rows of ravenous teeth.","Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the oceans floor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam. Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the oceans floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food. Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the waters, attacking passing ships as well as coastlines communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open waters. Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds. Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastlines communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them. Infamous Deeds Primarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them worthy of their notoriety. Humanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well-a field of the creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the day of the attack, which mclaim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not normally available to the gigas clams. Mof the merfolk still yearn to reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings. In the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji rivers delta, where they feed on the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the rivers's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures. The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry that the clams might organize a retributive assault. Adventure Hooks Gigas clams tend to remain passive during the cooler months, but those who venture too close to their homes during the wrong season might run afoul of the giant mollusks. • A trio of scavenger ships recently returned from looting Azlanti ruins only to meet their fate at the hands of a gigas clam, which smashed the ships to pieces and littered their treasures all over the sea floor below. Only the captain and two sailors survived the ordeal; the captain wants to return and claim what's his, while his two crew members want to have nothing to do with the sea for a long while. • In response to sightings of a gigas clam breaching the waters this past summer near Corentyn, the Chelish Navy issued notice of a substantial bounty on the strange beasts. Several folk plan to set sail to hunt the creature. One ship in particular is crewed entirely by tengus, who keep a mysterious contraption covered with oiled canvas on their ship's deck and guard it day and night.",12800
Gigas Hell,15,humanoid,any,"A giant like a mountains of corpses thunders into view. Armor crafted from the twisted bones of a hundred gigantic victims girds a twisted humanoid body covered in angry red burns and the jagged scars of crippling battles. Despite its wounds, the surviving figure exerts a terrible strength, hefting its grisly armor with ease.","The giants of the Pit, Hell gigas roam the hinterlands of Hell, stalking forth from ruined, millennia-old fortresses to enslave those who slip through the grasp of devilkind. Called ""phyriphlegeians"" by titans and some of the other elder races of the multiverse, these arrogant and most ancient of giants care only for their own tyrannies, petty schemes made abominable by their masters' scale, strength, and disregard for the survival of all other beings. More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction. The typical Hell gigas stands well over 50 feet tall and weighs upward of 20 tons, in addition to the weight of its armor of bone and metal. Ecology Exceptionally rare creatures, even on their native plane and compared to others of the waning gigas races, Hell gigas bear the crushing weight of beings that have endured millennia of life in Hell. Most appear as wasted giants bearing the scars of countless skirmishes and hardships, marmored over in half-living suits of exposed muscle, knotty bone, and grisly iron. Even with such second skins, the gigas radiate auras of infernal heat, which, along with their incredible strength, allow them to sculpt stone and iron into grim structures and vicious weapons. Habitat & Society Most Hell gigas live on the infernal layers of Avernus, Dis , and Phlegethon, keeping to the mountains and masterless expanses beyond the interests of devils and the damned. In some such realms lie the rare, crumbled ruins of fortresses even larger than the gigas' power to craft. Within these ruins and the lavasoaked catacombs below, the Hell gigas make their homes, living as despots apart from others of their kind, ruling over stray fiends, hellspawn, and wayward souls. Few Hell gigas care to venture forth from the infernal realm, finding other planes uncomfortably cold. When they do, they universally hold a special hatred for fire giants, loathing the giants yet at the same time delighting in enslaving them and forcing them to do their will. Hell gigas attempt to avoid devils as much as possible. While a gigas can easily crush most devils, those who slight greater devils or members of the diabolical nobility risk destruction or enslavement by the easily offended lords of Hell. The First Giants Scholars of the unfathomable eons that mark the immortal tides of extraplanar history have long debated by what means the inhabitants of the Material Plane took their varied-yet in mways similar-forms. Madhere to the assumption that creator deities designed each mortal race, creating what they deemed as right or desirable in miniature multitudes. Others, however, claim it began with the titans. Mighty beings, not unlike gods themselves in mways, titans possess power beyond most races and a history stretching back before even the oldest mortal races. Although the titan race has diminished, now inhabiting only the most remote corners of Elysium and the Thanatotic realms of the Abyss, their forms have persisted throughout the millennia, and their ancient progeny and myriad inheritors now range where titans once ruled. After ages of life upon the disparate planes of existence, the true titans gave rise to scions imbued with the powers of those strange realms, beings known as gigas, which were less than their progenitors but still mighty beyond reason. Distinctive to each realm the titans trod, the gigas rose as servants and emissaries of their lords and ancestors, carving out dominions among the natives of the planes that so shaped them. As countless ages passed and gates opened, allowing passage to the Material Plane, both titans and gigas found their way to new realms. While most titans cared little for these small, mundane worlds, the gigas found places where they could, for the first time, be masters in their own right. And as the gigas were born of both titankind and the planes, so were the gigas' spawn, the giants. Within the lands the gigas settled arose new beings, whole races specially adapted to life within their specific environs. With the march of countless epochs the titans waned, and so did their children, and their children's children. Today, titans remain rare, little-known even among the planes, declining as they suffer from the wounds of an ages-old conflict. The gigas, too, stand distant, removing to the frontiers of realms they once mastered-Hell gigas picking across the ruins of mountains fastnesses, Maelstrom gigas coasting ether storms upon islands of reality, Nirvana gigas crafting and dominating new dominions of dreams, and countless more withdrawing in the face of extinction. Even on the mortal plane, the age of giants has passed on most worlds, with the great beings of ancient times retreating in the face of countless lesser races, devoid of the giants' might yet powerful in numbers. Some draw a connection between humans  and giants suggestive of a heritage similar to that of giants, gigas, and the titans before them, yet from the limited vantage of mortal lives, few definite corollaries can be made. Perhaps in future eons the truth of such conjecture might make itself apparent to the inheritors of humankind.",51200

It has a long, narrow crocodilian snout and a cluster of antenna-like whiskers sweeping back from just above its jaws.","One of the rarest of sea serpents, the gilded serpent is known for its glittering golden hide, and is often hunted for this skin, and for the powerful narcotic that can be made from its venom. In the wild, gilded sea serpents live on the most secluded islands and hidden lagoons, where they nest in sandy lairs and shallow, sun-warmed waters. Wealthy coastlines lords have been known to acquire gilded sea serpent eggs or infants and raised them captivity. These serpents are usually revered as holy or prized as status symbols; captive gilded serpents that are mistreated quickly lose the will to live and die. The golden hide of a gilded serpent can be harvested and made into a single set of scale mail that fits a Medium or smaller creature. This armor is considered masterwork, and has the same properties as mithral scale armor. The poison of the gilded serpent can be milked or harvested as well, then made into a powerful narcotic drug called golden bliss . Gilded sea serpents flee danger when they can, using their ability to swim swiftly to evade danger as quickly as possible. If cornered or surprised, however, they lash out with their bite, and use their constriction attack if their prey is small enough. The venom of a gilded sea serpent numbs the flesh to pain and induces a state of catatonic stupor. Golden Bliss This drug is made from the venom of a gilded sea serpent.

Gillman,0.33,humanoid,temperate oceans,"A handsome, well-formed man walks out of the waves, the gill slits on the side of his neck flexing.","The enigmatic and reclusive gillmen  are the waters descendants of the vanished Azlanti race. When Earthfall struck Golarion and the continent of Azlant was shattered, most of the Azlanti dwelling died in the fires or drowned in the waves. Yet a number found succor with their undersea aboleth enemies. For reasons that remain unknown to this day , the aboleths rescued a small fraction of these drowning humans, warping their flesh to help them survive in the aboleths' uncontested undersea realm. Yet with that action, the aboleths seemed to lose interest, and in the thousands of years that followed, the gillmen formed a society of their own. Physically, gillmen resemble their ancient ancestors, with expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are close enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such  without fear of detection. Gillman Characters Gillmen are defined by their class levels- they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Girallon,6,magical beast,warm forests,"This four-armed, gorilla-like creature, covered with matted white fur, roars in rage as it rears up to its full, towering height.","Girallons are among the jungles's most dangerous predators. They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four muscular arms are capable of inf licting incredible damage on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds. Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary girallons are usually young males looking to start their own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack intruders without warning, including strangers of their own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring around their target and suddenly close in. While most girallons are little more than beasts, ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes hint that the girallon wasn't always the stupid creature it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. With each generation, these first girallons grew more and more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest part of the jungles. In addition to their intellects, these girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called ""high girallons,"" these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent girallon generally speaks whatever language the local humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange ruined cities in the junglesor mountains, and conduct raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends of four-armed ""white orcs.""",2400

All girtablilus share a zeal for religion, although the objects of veneration vary from tribe to tribe. Some girtablilu tribes still serve long-forgotten deities, preserving the divinities' names and holy rituals. Others embrace religions derived from prehistoric worship, devoted to the idea of gods that once were or might never have been. Girtablilu leaders are clerics or oracles, and are responsible for the tribe's religious observances and laws. Tradition and service to the group are important.

Glabrezu,13,outsider,any,Four arms grace the torso of this towering monstrosity. The monster's eyes shine with a mix of intelligence and cruelty.,"Whereas the succubus is a demon that works her wiles by exploiting the physical lusts and needs of her prey, the glabrezu is a tempter of a different sort. Ferocious and bestial in form, the glabrezu is in fact a master of trickery and lies. With its ability to cloak its true form in pleasant illusions, the glabrezu uses its magic to grant wishes to mortal humanoids as a method of rewarding those who succumb to its guile and deceit. A wish granted by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher's need in the most destructive way possible-although such methods might not be immediately apparent. A struggling weaponsmith might wish for fame and skill at his craft, only to find that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons to further his destructive desires. A lonely man who wishes for a companion might have his wish granted in the form of a lost love returned to ""life"" as a vampire, and so on-the glabrezu is nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal's desires. A glabrezu stands 18 feet tall and weighs just over 6,000 pounds.

Glacial Ooze,6,ooze,cold plains,At first glance what appears to be a snow bank or mound of snow reveals itself to be a sentient creature formed of snow and ice.,"This creature appears as translucent bluish-white icy sludge about 10 feet on each side . This ooze is conjectured to be a relative of the gelatinous cube, though a link between the two has yet to be established. The glacial ooze is at home in or out of the waters, and is often encountered inhabiting frozen or partially frozen lakes and rivers. It gains nutrients from waters and snow, absorbing them into its gelatinous form and digesting them. Like moozes, the glacial ooze is a scavenger and feeds on the carcasses of once living creatures that have frozen to death. Rather than completely digesting such creatures, the glacial ooze absorbs all bodily fluids and liquids from a corpse, leaving behind a frozen and rotted husk.

Glass Golem,8,construct,land,"This jagged construct of glass has a human's shape, save that one arm ends in a jagged hammer and another in a spike of glass.","A glass golem is a sizable guardian constructed by a powerful caster, usually in the shape of an armored humanoid. They are more common in deserts lands where quartz-based sand is readily available, or in urban centers where glassblowing is commonplace. A typical glass golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 2,500 pounds. Stained Glass Golems : Divine casters sometimes build glass golems that resemble the windowpanes commonly found in temples. Thin and agile, these colorful beings often act as spies, wielding powers of stealth that their other counterparts do not possess. A stained glass golem has a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks.

Glass Urchin,9,vermin,warm oceans or coastlines,This strange-looking creature has a spherical body covered with hundreds or thousands of two-foot-long bright purple spines that darken to ominous black tips.,"Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via oceans currents or, more commonly, tides. Hunter Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues that can whip out and pull food to them. Spear Urchins: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed. Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin's venom. Sea Urchins as Difficult Terrain The giant sea urchins presented here are fantastic evolutions of their much more common, smaller, and less offensive kin. Yet even the smaller common urchins can pose a problem for unwary adventurers. Sea urchins live in vast colonies on tidal rocks, and moving across a field of urchins can be quite awkward and painful. Their thousands of spines are just as sharp as those possessed by their larger kin, and they function as caltrops to anyone that walks over them. Worse, these spines are venomous, and can poison those who take damage from them. Those who succumb to the poison suffer searing pain that can sicken them for several minutes. Though uncomfortable, fortunately this venom doesn't actually inf lict either ability damage or ability drain. Sea Urchin Venom: Spines-injury; save Fort 11; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect victim is sickened for 1 minute; cure 1 save.",6400
Glass Wyrm,12,dragon,underground,"This creature appears to be formed of crystal or glass. Its scales are semi-transparent and appear razor-sharp. Its head is angular with two blade-like horns swept back across its crown. A glass fin-like crest starts near the base of its skull, runs down the center of its back and tapers off as it reaches the monster's tail. Its large wings are translucent and the sound of grating glass can be heard as the beast moves.","Glass wyrms are relatives of other dragons and are believed to have their origin on another plane of existence. They make their home beneath the surface world and enjoy the relative solitude of the underground world. Their lairs normally consist of a maze of twisting and winding corridors meant to confuse and befuddle trespassers. Their lairs are littered with scores and scores of gemstones and broken glass . Glass wyrms sustain themselves on a diet of gemstones and natural minerals, and rarely eat meat . In battle a glass wyrm relies on their breath weapon and natural attacks, switching between them as the battle warrants. Powerful foes are always targeted first and subjected to the monster's breath weapon. Some glass wyrms keep torches or other light sources scattered about their labyrinthine lairs so they can use their reflective hide to blind trespassers and enter combat quickly before their opponents can react.

Globster,5,ooze,oceans or coastlines,"This grotesque mass of blubber and rancid flesh piles up hideously upon itself, opening a vast maw filled with teeth.","A globster is a living collection of half-digested parts from large sea creatures such as whales and squid. Passersby usually discover it by smell long before they see it. Munfortunate folk who happen upon a globster mistake it for the carcass of a beached sea animal, getting too close before discovering the seemingly dead creature is very much alive. For a time, sages believed globsters were undead-that they were simply undulating wads of rotting flesh animated with a drive to feed. However, globsters are actually living creatures. Globsters usually wash up on a beach or float to the shore to feed on terrestrial stock for a few hours before returning to the safety of waters. Some say the tides and phases of the moon are to blame for the times globsters come to land to feed. Globsters reproduce by mixing parts of their own foul bodies with the poorly digested remains of their meals.",1600
Gloom Crawler,8,magical beast,underground,"This giant, squid-like beast has thirty to forty tentacles, each about 30 feet long. At the end of each tentacle stares a small, round, lidless eye with a stark blue pupil. The creature's glossy flesh is inky-black with a slightly paler underside centered upon a vicious looking, monstrously-sized, hooked beak.","The gloom crawler is a solitary creature resembling a giant squid with blackened skin and a large mass of writhing squid-like tentacles. It makes its lair in underground caves, dungeons, and other such subterranean complexes far away from the daylight of the surface world and spends most of its time dormant, waking every so often to eat. The gloom crawler moves along its underground world using the suction cups on its tentacles to pull itself along. The average gloom crawler has anywhere from thirty to forty tentacles, each averaging 15 to 30 feet long. In addition, each tentacle has a small eye near the tip that allows it to see in direction at time if it wishes. When prey is encountered the gloom crawler brings as mtentacles to bear on a foe as it can, using its smaller tentacles to move around during combat. Gloom crawlers are omnivorous creatures sustaining themselves on a diet of subterranean plants, mosses, rodents, and other subterranean fauna. They do not, however, turn down the chance for a larger meal, such as that offered by a foolhardy adventurer that stumbles into a gloom crawler lair. When an opponent first approaches a gloom crawler, it lashes out with its tentacles attempting to grab a foe. If successful, it hangs on and constricts that opponent while fighting off other foes with its other tentacles. A held foe is also pulled in close so the gloom crawler can bite with its beak. A gloom crawler can bring up to five tentacles to bear on a single 5-foot space. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
Gloomwing,4,outsider,Plane of Shadow,"This creature looks like a giant moth. Its body and wings are black with spiraled patterns of silver. Two large black antennae protrude from its head. Eight legs run the length of its body, each ending in a pearly-white claw. Its mouth has two large pearly-white mandibles.","The gloomwing is native to the Plane of Shadow and is often summoned to the Material Plane by spellcasters to act as a guardian. On occasion, a gloomwing slips through a tear in the fabric of the planes and enters the Material Plane on its own. The gloomwing is the adult stage of the tenebrous worm . Female gloomwings lay their eggs in the bodies of slain victims. In 12 days, these eggs hatch, releasing 4-10 tenebrous worms. The ivory mandibles of a gloomwing can be pried or broken from its carcass and sold for 100 gp each. Gloomwings are aggressive creatures and fight from the air. They hover and flitter about an opponent, biting with their mandibles and slashing with their claws . After the first round of combat, a gloomwing secretes a pheromone that calls other gloomwings in the area to its aid. The pheromone also acts as a weakening agent against non-insect creatures in the area. Credit The Gloomwing originally appeared in the First Edition Monster Manual II  and is used by permission.

Gnarlwood,11,plant,temperate forests,"This creature resembles a treant but instead of the kindly, gentle face of the tree-folk its face is twisted into a grim scowl. Its deep-set eyes and jagged mouth give it an almost skull-like grimace and its four twisted arms are tipped in sharp woody claws. Its leaves are deep green, almost black, and have ghostly white markings on them. Behind it, the skeletal remains of unfortunate animals shamble through the undergrowth.","Gnarlwoods are grown from the seeds of treants that had the misfortune of sprouting in land cursed by an unhallow spell. The good nature of the treant is subverted by the very nourishment it gains from the earth, and the evil of the spell suffuses into its every fiber. Most gnarlwoods die before they are much larger than twiggy saplings, since few creatures of nature can survive on a diet of pure evil. Those that do survive grow into menacing, twisted mockeries of treants, with four knobby arms that end in cruel barbed claws. Gnarlwoods are spiteful, hateful things that seek to destroy everything they see. Bereft of compassion, gnarlwoods tear through forests accompanied by the shambling corpses of its victims, rending and clawing anything that moves. Some evil druidic temples secluded deep in ancient forests are protected by entire groves of gnarlwoods. Unfortunately for the worshippers, not even they are spared the psychotic wrath of the gnarlwood. A gnarlwood usually begins combat with its protection from good in effect  and normally sends its minions  into battle to distract or soften up its foes. In the first round it attempts to use its slay living spell-like ability against a creature it deems highly susceptible . In the next round it assaults its opponents with its claws, rending opponent it hits with at least two of its claws. It sprinkles combat with its spell-like abilities throughout. During battle, if possible, it tries to keep undead minions it has with it within the confines of its unhallowed aura so enemy clerics find it hard to affect them with their channel energy ability. A gnarlwood constantly howls and wails during battle and always fights to the death. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",12800
Gnasher Lizard,8,magical beast,temperate forests or mountains,"This 10-foot long stone-colored lizard has a large, wide gaping maw filled with double rows of dagger-like teeth. Its head is large and flat and sports a ridge of hardened bone that runs the length of its head before tapering off near the middle of its back. Its four legs end in large, flat clawed feet.","The gnasher is a deadly predator that often roams up to 3 miles from its lair in search of prey. Though its appearance lends to the façade of being a slow moving lizard, it is in fact, rather graceful and quick. Those that make the mistake of assuming the gnasher is slow-moving rarely live to tell others of their mistake. Gnasher lizards make their lairs in stony areas, typically forests clearings or mountains terrain, usually near  a waters source. They are carnivorous creatures and highly territorial, even attacking their own kind if one gnasher lizard intrudes upon the territory of another. Gnashers are solitary creatures and only come together to mate . Mating season is the only time more than one of these creatures is encountered together, and once the mating ritual is ended, each goes its own way. The female lays a clutch of 1d4+2 eggs which hatch within 3 months. Young reach maturity within 8 months and are left to their own devices. A gnasher lizard is typically 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20 feet or more. A typical gnasher weighs about 1,000 pounds. Though most are stone gray, some variants encountered have been colored greenishbrown or black. Its long fang-like teeth are razor-sharp and it uses these to tear its prey into pieces. Gnasher lizards typically attack from ambush, using their surroundings to conceal themselves and springing out at the last second to catch their opponents by surprise. Gnashers attack creature that wanders into their territory, including those larger than themselves, relying on their vorpal bite to quickly dispatch such creatures. When it swallows a foe, a gnasher lizard typically holds it in its stomach for several rounds before regurgitating it into its mouth, snapping down on it with its razor-sharp teeth and then swallowing it again.

Gnoll,1,humanoid,warm plains or deserts,"Hunched and feral, this furred, hyena-headed humanoid stands slightly taller than the average human.","Gnolls are a race of hulking, humanoids that resemble hyenas in more than mere appearance; they show a striking affinity with the scavenging animals, to the point of keeping them as pets, and ref lect mof the lesser creatures' behaviors. Gnolls are capable hunters, but are far happier to scavenge or steal a kill than to go out and track down prey. This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of whatever type is available, whom they force to dig warrens, gather supplies and waters, and even hunt for their gnoll masters. Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little different from other creature. The more ""civilized"" gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade with other tribes or slaver bands. Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or valor, instead preferring to flee once it becomes clear that victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with tail tucked away than to lose one's tail entirely. During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to flee. Gnoll leaders are typically rangers, although clerics are highly regarded as well. Most gnolls find arcane magic difficult to master, and as a result it is relatively rare to see a gnoll bard, sorcerer, or wizard.",400
Gnoll Mutant,4,aberration,warm plains or deserts,"Patchy, matted fur covers this mutated, hyena-headed monster, and acidic green drool pours from its ravenous maw.","The magic-warping effects of the Mana Wastes often extend to the very life force of creatures who wander the trackless deserts. The dangerous radiations of magic gone afoul infuse the bodies and essences of these wanderers. Those who spend too much time in the Spellscar deserts or the wasteland's other treacherous environs occasionally fall prey to the deadly energies that persist in these regions, and their bodies gradually decay more and more until they are so far removed from their original forms that they can be described only as mutants. These twisted and degenerate creatures roam in packs throughout the Mana Wastes. Because those who succumb to the Mana Wastes' mutagenic effects often hail from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar or one of its smaller holdings in the region, numerous humanoid mutants are proficient in the use of firearms, having learned to wield the weapons in place of the unpredictable forces of magic. Those who manage to actually secure a powerful weapon from one of the dwarven arms factories in the Wastes often garner the respect of other mutants. Such firearm wielders invariably rise to positions of power, becoming known as wasteland lords by their envious peers, who all squabble and fight for the same honor. Most Mana Wastes mutants collaborate in small tribal groups with other mutants, since those who wander the battered deserts alone risk attack from the resident mutated vermin or violent bands of lawless gnolls, giants, or goblins. The civilized people of Alkenstar shun mutants for the most part, regarding transformed humans and other wanderers of the Mana Wastes as no better than monsters. The border guards of neighboring Nex keep a stringent lookout for such wasteland travelers and attack them on sight. The necromancers of Geb, however, see potential in the mutated peoples of the Spellscar deserts, and occasionally entreat them to leave their blasted home and relocate to the heart of Geb in Yled by promising a life of comfort and acceptance. In actuality, such mutants are taken to the infamous Mortuarium, where Geb's cruelest wizards perform unholy experiments on Alkenstar's deformed expatriates and turn them into undead abominations to serve in Geb's lurching army. CREATING A MANA WASTES MUTANT ""Mana Wastes Mutant"" is an acquired template that can be added to living, corporeal creature. A Mana Wastes mutant retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: As base creature +1. Alignment: Any non-lawful. Type: The creature's type changes to aberration. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class: A Mana Wastes mutant gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor over the base creature's natural armor bonus. Defensive Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, DR 5/cold iron , and spell resistance equal to 11 + its adjusted CR. Mana Wastes mutants are immune to disease and poison. Speed: A winged Mana Wastes mutant's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, it loses this ability. Melee: A Mana Wastes mutant retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the mutant's size. Spell-Like Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant loses access to spell-like abilities the base creature may have had. Any spellcasting abilities gained from class levels remain unchanged. Special Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant retains extraordinary and supernatural special qualities of the base creature. A Mana Wastes mutant gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof . Acid Resistance : A Mana Wastes mutant gains resistance to acid 10. This ability can be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, the Mana Wastes mutant increases its resistance to acid by an additional 10. A Mana Wastes mutant that gains acid resistance in excess of 30 becomes immune to acid instead. Acidic Pustules : Mana Wastes mutants are often covered in necrotic pustules that burst at the slightest touch. Whenever a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to a Mana Wastes mutant, all creatures adjacent to the Mana Wastes mutant must succeed at a Ref lex save  or take acid damage as its boils and blisters pop and spray about. A Mana Wastes mutant deals an amount of acid damage in this way based on its size . Breath Weapon : A Mana Wastes mutant can spray a 30-foot cone of acidic bile from its mouth as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. The acid damage caused by this attack is equal to 1d6 per two Hit Dice the mutant possesses. A successful Ref lex save  halves damage taken from this attack. Disease : Even though Mana Wastes mutants are immune to disease, they carry a deadly magical contagion that they spread with their slam attacks. Mana fever: injury; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the Mana Wastes mutant's Hit Dice + the Mana Wastes mutant's Constitution modifier; onset 1d4 minutes; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain ; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who lives with mana fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease, but also becomes a Mana Wastes mutant. Increased Speed : Some Mana Wastes mutants are transformed in such a way that their base speed increases by 10 feet. Deformities: In addition to its special abilities listed above, a Mana Wastes mutant gains one of the following deformities from its transformation . d% Effect 1 Deformed Arm: One hand can't wield weapons, but the mutant's slam attack deals damage as if it were two size categories larger than its actual size. 2 Deformed Leg: The mutant's base speed is reduced by 10 feet , but it gains a +4 racial bonus to its CMD. 3 Shattered Mind: The mutant takes a -2 penalty to Intelligence, but gains a +2 racial bonus on Will saves. 4 Warped Hide: The mutant loses its +2 racial bonus to Con, but gains an additional +2 bonus to its natural armor. Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +2, Con +2, Cha -2. Skills: A Mana Wastes mutant gains Climb, Intimidate, Stealth, and Survival as class skills.",1200
Gnoph-Keh,11,magical beast,cold,"A vortex of freezing wind swirls around this six-legged, bearlike monstrosity. A single horn protrudes from its snarling face.","The gnoph-keh is a six-legged horned creature vaguely akin to a polar bear in shape and outline, yet possessed of a cruel and creative intellect that elevates it from the rank of wild beast to murderous warmonger. Covered with a dense pelt of shaggy white fur, the gnoph-keh is equally at home walking on two, four, or six legs. The creature prefers to travel on all six when using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the gnophkeh's ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its ability to move and see in such conditions without disadvantage, the creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells. Ecology The gnoph-keh is, and always has been, a beast of the frozen white realms. Temperatures above freezing are uncomfortable to the gnoph-keh, to the extent that prolonged exposure to warm or hot temperatures can actually kill this mighty creature. Its aura of cold helps to protect it somewhat when it ventures into temperate areas, but once in a subtropical or similarly heated environment, the monster's freezing body cannot compensate-its flesh begins to literally melt, as if it were composed of ice and snow. The gnoph-keh has watersy blue blood, and as it melts, this pale fluid runs in copious, steaming gouts from its body, inf licting severe pain on the creature. Accounts of gnoph-kehs being driven to blind rage in such conditions and simply attacking all nearby creatures and objects with no attempt to seek safety are likely apocryphal, since a gnoph-keh presented with such extreme temperatures generally does everything in its power to flee. They can use their ability to create blizzards to delay this fate, but in hot areas, the fact that this ability lasts only a minute usually only postpones the inevitable. Although once much more numerous, gnoph-kehs today are spread quite thin through the frozen wastelands and mountains heights they prefer to dwell in. This, combined with the creatures' long gestation period, means that few gnoph-kehs are born. The monsters are exceptionally long-lived, with all indications that they can survive for centuries, or even millennia, if not slain by sickness or violence. Gnoph-kehs typically only seek out others of their kind for two reasons-to mate  or to make war. Gnoph-kehs are hermaphrodites, capable of fertilizing others of their kind while also capable of becoming pregnant . Despite its resemblance to a mammal, the gnoph-keh does not birth live young-instead, it lays a clutch of a dozen or so furry eggs that it buries in the snow or in the ice of a glacier. As the eggs grow, they slowly absorb each other until finally only a single egg remains. The creature inside doesn't hatch as much as it simply absorbs the leathery, furry sphere that surrounds it, transforming into a fully grown gnoph-keh. Habitat & Society The primary driving force behind gnoph-keh society is war-not between themselves, but against other creatures that share their realms. Whether this drive to wage war is rooted in a strange psychological need, spurred by racial memories of the creatures' interactions with even more hostile races in the distant past, or something else entirely, there can be no denying that the gnoph-kehs enjoy the act of spreading misery to other races-particularly to humanoids. The only times a gnophkeh interacts with one of these ""lesser races"" is to subjugate it for the purposes of establishing an army that the gnoph-kehs can then use against similar races, for the only thing that eclipses a gnoph-keh's lust for warfare is the delight in turning tribes against each other. Once one tribe wipes out all of its competitors, the inevitable result is the final destruction of the victorious tribe by its own hateful commander. In this way, a single gnoph-keh can eradicate far larger groups than it would normally be able to destroy on its own. While gnoph-keh society may seem monolithic to humanity, this is largely due to the simple fact that most of humanity's interactions with the gnoph-kehs are in the framework of pain and death. And while gnoph-kehs do not usually gather in groups or build cities, there is evidence that this is not always the case in certain strange and ancient ruins found in frozen corners of the world. Most gnoph-kehs spend their time alone in contemplation or worship of strange statues they carve from glaciers or frozen lakes. The countenances of these gnoph-keh gods are alien and frightening. Very few gnoph-keh clerics or other divine spellcasters exist, prompting some scholars to theorize that these statues are in fact effigies of a long-forgotten and even more terrible force-perhaps the same one that nearly drove the gnoph-kehs into extinction so long ago and instilled in their minds such an overwhelming predisposition for war.",12800

Goblin,0.33,humanoid,temperate forests or plains,"This creature stands barely three feet tall, its scrawny, humanoid body dwarfed by its wide, ungainly head.","Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense thickets of thistles and brambles, or in structures built and then abandoned by others. Very few goblins have the drive to build structures of their own. coastlines are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting through junk and flotsam in an unending quest to find treasures among the refuse of more civilized races. Goblin hatred runs deep, and few things inspire their wrath more than gnomes , horses , and regular dogs . Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic with a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the habit of ascribing magic to the mundane as well, with fire and writing both taking on mystical power in goblin society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its capacity to wreak great destruction and because it doesn't require size or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins believe that writing steals words out of your head, and as a result of this belief, goblins are universally illiterate. Goblins are voracious and can eat their body weight in food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs always have numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer human and gnome flesh, a goblin won't turn down food-except, perhaps, vegetables. Goblin Characters Goblins are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Goblin Dog,1,animal,"temperate forests, swamps, or underground","This mangy canine's face has the same flat nose, beady eyes, and protruding teeth as a rat grown grotesquely large.","Loathed by men and beasts alike, goblin dogs are ugly, stinking, craven, and foul-tempered. It's no surprise that goblins find kindred spirits in these shunned, disgusting beasts. Constantly itching, aff licted with a species-wide mange exacerbated by prolific dander, even the healthiest goblin dog looks sickly and starved. Despite its name, the goblin dog is in fact a species of rodent grown monstrously large. Their long-legged shape and proclivity to hunt and run in packs earned them their popular name, a name that mgoblins take issue with, as it galls the average goblin to consider these, their favored mounts, having anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven't bothered to come up with alternate names for goblin dogs. Perhaps they don't realize they can. Contact with a goblin dog's infested, mangy hide causes most other creatures to break out into hives, a condition known as ""goblin rash."" Goblinoids seem to be immune to this affliction, and are fond of keeping goblin dogs as guardians and mounts. Despite their skin conditions and disorders, goblin dogs are highly resistant to disease. Their favored food is carrion-the riper, the better. That mgoblin tribes let their goblin dogs run free in their lairs is the single reason most goblin dens aren't filthier than they actually are; constantly hungry, a goblin dog eats anything it can chew that it finds left behind by other, more discerning palates.

Goblin Snake,1,aberration,underground or swamps,"A gray, lipless goblin head with serpent's fangs sits atop the sinuous black body of this greasy-scaled snake.","Tenacious predators and bullies, goblin snakes are shrill, impulsive, and endlessly hungry. When their instinctual cunning takes hold, however, these maniacal creatures exhibit all the stealth and deadly cunning of serpents coupled with the capricious destructiveness of goblins. Cruel and selfish, goblin snakes care for little more than their next meals and indulging their unfounded arrogance. Like goblins, they can easily eat their body weight in food daily, but goblin snakes are also lazy, and are more likely to settle for easy meals rather than ones they must work to find. As a result, goblins snakes eat almost anything within reach and readily available, from carrion to rubbish . Goblin snakes delight in fresh meat, but strongly prefer having others bring it to them over hunting and killing it themselves. Enjoying the compof snakes, goblin snakes are often accompanied by several smaller venomous serpents, which the goblin snakes use to protect their lairs and supplement their food supply. Goblin snakes are exceedingly jealous of nagas, however, envying their serpentine majesty and mastery of magic. Enterprising and cunning goblin snakes have been known to impersonate nagas, demanding tribute and food from gullible creatures in awe of the ""naga's"" supposed magical abilities. Some scholars have noted the superficial similarities between goblin snakes and nagas, and have gone as far as to theorize that the goblin snake might be a particularly weak breed of naga-a theory that most nagas do not appreciate at all. Although goblin snakes are not as smart as goblins, their terrifying shape allows them to take positions of inf lated prominence within goblin society. Fearful goblins typically defer to the beasts, which well suits the goblin snakes' innate arrogance and sense of superiority. Goblin snakes affiliated with goblin tribes usually treat their goblin associates as servants at best and slaves at worst. Goblin snakes share goblins' fear of horses  and love of fire , but they are not as superstitious as goblins. Goblin snakes eagerly embrace magic if given the opportunity, and it is not uncommon for a goblin snake with adept, cleric, oracle, or sorcerer class levels to serve as a goblin tribe's shaman or high priest.",400
Gohl,9,aberration,underground,"This creature appears as a floating blob of mottled black and gray flesh.

Msmaller tentacles jut from its central form only to disappear back into its trunk just as quickly as they appeared.","Gohls are nightmarish creatures found lurking in desolate ruins or subterranean caverns.

Each of its three heads is gold with red eyes and has a wide mouth lined with double rows of needle-sharp teeth. Each neck is scaled gold and turns to dark green as it nears the gohl's body. The underside of each neck is slightly lighter in color. Gohls communicate with others of their kind by changing the color of their trunk. In combat, a gohl can release a loud, metallic-sounding roar from one of its heads and often does so, in an effort to scare its adversaries. Gohl's make no effort to disguise themselves or hide from opponents. As soon as intruders are detected in their area, they move to intercept them. The gohl begins combat by grabbing a foe with a tentacle. A grabbed foe is subjected to as mbite attacks each round as the gohl can bring against it. Multiple opponents are often grabbed and bitten as well. Foes that are killed by a gohl are carried to its lair and digested. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",6400
Golden Cat,1,magical beast,temperate,This marvelous creature appears as a small housecat with sleek golden fur and glowing emerald eyes.,"These fickle creatures are highly sought after due to their magical ability to grant luck to one fortunate enough to be selected as an owner. Such owners are known to spend extravagant amounts of wealth keeping the golden cat lavishly protected and comforted. Despite this, golden cats have been known to grow bored with an owner and strike out on their own in search of a new owner to bestow its good luck upon. While prized by their owners for the luck they bestow, golden cats are equally despised by the owner's allies for the bad luck they bring. Golden cats tend to lair in forestsed areas or hillsy terrain, usually near civilized lands where the population is the greatest . They favor humans and elves as owners above all other races, disdaining the less civilized races such as orcs, half-orcs, goblinoids, and so on. A golden cat never takes one of the aforementioned races as an owner. A golden cat appears as a normal cat with rich golden fur and green eyes. Like all cats, a golden cat enjoys catching mice, rabbits and small birds. They tend to avoid attacking things larger than themselves unless cornered and defending themselves. Even then, they seek escape as soon as possible. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Golden Guardian,6,construct,any,"This gilded statue appears to be crafted of solid gold plates, its shining visage carved with exquisite detail into an eerie replica of a human face.","Golden guardians are humanoid automatons formed of iron, steel, and most of all, gold. Their appearance can range from rough, lumpy humanoid shapes to statue-shaped conglomerations of gold coins to exquisitely detailed gilded statues with eerily accurate human faces.

Goliath Stag Beetle,8,vermin,warm forests or plains,"This massive beetle is the size of a small house. Its immense, horn-like mandibles clash with a hungry fervor.","Making its home in tropical and subtropical forests across the globe, the goliath beetle is among the largest species of giant beetle. While its diminutive cousins are primarily herbivores, the goliath stag beetle is carnivorous, hunting herd animals, humanoids, and even giants with ease. They typically use their trample attack against creatures smaller than themselves, returning after this punishing assault to pick off anything that's still moving with swift and deadly bites.

Gongorinan,11,outsider,underground,"This human-sized crablike creature scuttles on six stumpy legs, and each of its four arms sports a different method of inflicting pain.","The gongorinans are the spawn of the nascent qlippoth lord Yamasoth, although one could be forgiven for thinking them of them less as offspring and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an immense, stocky crab, save that they lack all of the features crabs have adapted for an waters life-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical gongorinan possesses no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that. Each gongorinan has four of these, and each arm is a different, highly specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or the wielding of weaponry, while the mantislike claw is used to shred flesh and create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to snatch and hold victims close for oviposition. A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder. Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist , but these are quite rare on the Material Plane save for in the depths of Hollow mountains. Ecology All gongorinans carry within their bodies a brood of horrific egg masses, yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind . Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans' lord, Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs. The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor that's not quite tongue and not quite toothed prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the process of oviposition leaves the horrid creature open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to the lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed. Once an egg has been implanted, it takes mdays to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location. Victims are often cocooned in webs or left stranded in high cavern ledges far above the ground so that the egg can gestate. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't hatch so much as it merely merges with the host, effecting a horrific and permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can inf luence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful creatures that are already found in the region, for these ""young"" are loyal to their parent and serve as loyal guardians or playthings. Victims retain no true portion of their previous personality, but those who have been rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of their time as a transformed monstrosity. Mnever quite recover from these ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard their monstrous life as having been their true life, and their true life as the curse. The most despondent of these victims eventually seek the promise of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing. Habitat & Society Gongorinans are an industrious and intelligent breed of qlippoth, and where they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes to live in. These gongorinan ""cities"" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers for their transformed children to live in. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but even the Material Plane is no stranger to gongorinan hive cities. The largest of these hives are thought to be located deep beneath Hollow mountains, where Runelord Alaznist lured the Polymorph Plague himself, Yamasoth, into dwelling for a time. While Yamasoth has long vacated the Darklands caverns under Hollow mountains, they bear the name of his spawn- Gongorina-and his spawn dwell there still.",12800
Gorbel,0.5,aberration,warm forests,"This bizarre creature is a small orb with reddish skin. Atop its round body are six eyestalks, each ending in a sapphire-colored eye. Dangling beneath its body are two stubby legs that end in claws.","The gorbel is a strange creature approximately 3 feet in diameter. Its reddish skin is a thin but tough and rubbery membrane. The spherical body of a gorbel is highly elastic and filled to near bursting with a lighter-than air flammable gas that smells of rotten eggs . A gorbel eats, breathes, and excretes through an aperture best described as a mouth. This mouth is lined with a ring of sharp teeth that face inward to help it force food into its gullet. Gorbels primarily attack with their claws, only resorting to biting after they have latched onto their prey. A gorbel will attack and try to eat whatever it thinks is edible - generally including anything that moves that is smaller than the gorbel. Its strange metabolic processes instill it with an almost insatiable hunger. Credit The Gorbel originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio  and is used by permission.

It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of lion. It is a highly territorial predator whose hunting range often covers several square miles around its lair. The creature makes its home inside caves high atop mountains or deep inside caverns. A typical lair contains a mated pair and one or two young. A gorgimera's dragon head can be that of of the evil dragons . The lion head has no mane, and the scaled gorgon head is a deep navy blue with glowing red eyes. A gorgimera prefers to attack from ambush. It usually attacks by biting with its lion head and dragon head, butting with its gorgon head, and slashing with its front leonine paws. In lieu of biting, the dragon head and gorgon head can emit their respective breath weapons.

Gorgon,8,magical beast,"temperate plains, rocky hills, or underground",This bull-like creature seems to be made of interlocking metallic plates. Faint plumes of green smoke puff from its mouth.,"Gorgons are magical, foul-tempered creatures-while they might appear to be constructs at first glance, beneath their artificallooking armor plates they are made of flesh and bone. Like aggressive bulls, they challenge unfamiliar creature they encounter, often trampling their opponent's corpse or shattering its stony remnants until the creature is unrecognizable. The females are just as dangerous as the males, and the two sexes appear identical. A typical gorgon stands 6 feet tall and 8 feet long. It weighs 4,000 pounds. Gorgons derive nutrients from the consumption of minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and statues they create are likely to be gnawed thoroughly. They cannot digest metal or gems, so their dung  often contains small, raw crystals and nuggets of ore. Their aggression toward all other creatures means that there are few to no predators or other prey animals in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull. Their flesh is tough but beefy , and to those who acquire the taste, quite filling. Mstone giant tribes believe eating gorgon meat enhances their own natural armor. Powdered gorgon horn is worth 250 gp as an alternate material component for magic items using bull's strength, stoneskin, flesh to stone, statue, and similar magic.",4800

This stat block can generally be used for of the larger types of primates, such as gorillas-for smaller apes like orangutans and chimpanzees, apply the young simple template. Even smaller primates should use the stats for monkeys found on page 132.

Gorilla Bear,5,magical beast,warm forests,This creature resembles a massive gorilla with shaggy dark fur and the forepaws of a powerful bear.

A gorilla bear's fur is always dark and ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Its paws and feet end in elongated nails, brown in color. A typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 1,700 pounds. Its eyes are always one of two colors crimson or emerald green. No other eye color has ever been seen on a gorilla bear . Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves or caverns, often hidden among the twisted tangle of trees and shrubs of jungles. They are diurnal  hunters and feast on a diet of meat, savoring the taste of goblins and elves. A typical lair contains a mated pair and 1d4 young. Gorilla bears are highly aggressive and attack their prey relentlessly. Gorilla bears never retreat and always fight until either they are all dead or their opponents are all dead. Opponents that attempt to flee are usually run down. Gorilla bears attack with their claws, cutting huge chunks of flesh from a foe when a claw attack hits. When presented with the opportunity, gorilla bears grab their opponent and squeeze them until dead, gnashing and biting at a grappled foe with their pointed teeth.

No friend to its true dragon cousins, a gorynych sometimes threatens green and black dragons for mastery of their lands. A gorynych seeks out young dragons that have only established small hoards, killing the rival creatures and claiming their treasures as its own. It dominates drakes and wyverns, but true dragons consider it a repulsive throwback to an ancient line of mutants and deviants. Motivated by greed, gluttony, and unnatural lust, a gorynych lives to collect treasure, feast as often as possible, and chase after humanoid maidens, using alter self and charm person as necessary. Gorynyches are particularly creative with the use of their limited wishes in duplicating other spell effects to secure their desires and complete their hideous tasks.

Gourd Leshy,1,plant,hills or plains,This little plant man walks on legs like tangled vines and has a pumpkin carved with eyes and a mouth for a head.,"With tangles of leafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for a head, gourd leshys present a rather comical appearance. Intimately connected with the harvest season, gourd leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of crops, especially vegetables and grains. Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd leshys. They do their best to exactly reproduce what worked before with every trivial activity, and change seemingly random details when attempting tasks they previously failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and ends as good luck charms, ranging from polished stones to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets. As gourd leshys aren't particularly strong, they often fight dirty. One favorite trick is to wait for an enemy to come within striking distance while in gourd form so that they can assume their true form and make a sneak attack in the same round. GROWING A GOURD LESHY Gourd leshys grow best in small vegetable patches or in sunny meadows. Carving eyes and a mouth into a growing gourd leshy's ""face"" is an important part of the growth ritual, for neglecting to do this robs the gourd leshy of its ability to see or speak.

Grand Defender,15,construct,land,This mighty golem made of polished iron resembles a keen-eyed dwarf. It carries a warhammer and a large shield bearing Torag's symbol.,"Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals or communities. Ecology The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its ""empty"" state only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the herald. As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the compof other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its sense of ""taste"" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability. Habitat & Society Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity, the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and more embarrassing over the centuries.",51200
Grave Risen,4,undead,any,"This rotting, worm-ridden corpse is draped in tattered and loosely fitting rags and dented and armor. Blackened eye sockets serve as its eyes, and the stench of death clings to its body. Its nails are long and filthy, caked with dirt and soil from the grave.","Grave risen are rotting undead creatures that upon first glance resemble zombies. They are created from a normal corpse in an area where the blood of a spellcaster is spilled and permeates the ground. The blood fuses with a corpse which sometimes animates as a grave risen. These creatures rarely wander far from the area where they were risen, preferring the stench of death and the serenity of death that lingers in the air. Grave risen have no love for the living and attack living creatures on sight. Living creatures slain by a grave risen are clawed and mutilated and then buried in a shallow grave by the grave risen as a mockery of its own current existence. Grave risen do not speak or communicate; only occasionally loosing guttural tones from their rotting vocal organs. Since grave risen are rarely encountered anywhere but cemeteries, burial grounds, or the like, they usually begin combat by animating corpses and sending them against their aggressors. After animating corpses, the grave risen attempts to down its foes with its filthy claws. Slain foes are destroyed  and are not consumed by a grave risen. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Graveknight,11,undead,land,"Shadows veil what lurks within the dark, imposing armor of this figure, though two piercing eyes gaze from its closed visor.","Undying tyrants and eternal champions of the undead, graveknights arise from the corpses of the most nefarious warlords and disgraced heroes-villains too merciless to submit to the shackles of death. They bear the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight's essence is fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of its battle lust. This armor becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone locked within. CREATING A GRAVEKNIGHT ""Graveknight"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice . Most graveknights were once humanoids. A graveknight uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The graveknight's type changes to undead . Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft. Aura: A graveknight emanates the following aura. Sacrilegious Aura : A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the spell desecrate and uses the graveknight's armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits of this effect . In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or spell with the healing subtype-must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's Hit Dice + the graveknight's Charisma modifier. If the character fails, the effect is expended but does not function. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a graveknight uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points. Defensive Abilities: A graveknight gains channel resistance +4; DR 10/magic; and immunity to cold, electricity, and additional energy type noted by its ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also gains spell resistance equal to its augmented CR + 11. The graveknight also gains the following ability. Rejuvenation : One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the undead horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the process anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully healed. Attacks: A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the graveknight's size . Special Attacks: A graveknight gains the following special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's HD + the graveknight's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Channel Destruction : Any weapon a graveknight wields seethes with energy, and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice the graveknight has. This additional damage is of the energy type determined by the ruinous revivification special quality. Devastating Blast : Three times per day, the graveknight may unleash a 30-foot cone of energy as a standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight has . This damage is of the energy type determined by the graveknight's ruinous revivification special quality. Undead Mastery : As a standard action, a graveknight can attempt to bend undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the graveknight's control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day to break free from the graveknight's control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same graveknight's undead mastery for 24 hours. A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the graveknight exceeds this number, the excess from earlier uses of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per animate dead. Special Qualities: A graveknight gains the following. Phantom Mount : Once per hour, a graveknight can summon a skeletal horse similar to a phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom steed, and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on the graveknight's total Hit Dice rather than caster level. A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later. Ruinous Revivification : At the time of its creation, the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type inf luences the effects of several of a graveknight's special abilities. Ability Scores: Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a graveknight has no Constitution score. Skills: Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Ride checks. Feats: Graveknights gain Improved Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, and Toughness as bonus feats. GRAVEKNIGHT ARMOR In death, the graveknight's life force lingers on in its armor, not its corpse, in much the same way that a lich's essence is bound within a phylactery. Unless every part of a graveknight's armor is ruined along with its body, a graveknight can rejuvenate after it is destroyed. A typical suit of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit points, though armor with enhancements or made of special materials proves more difficult to destroy. Merely breaking a graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it must be ruined, such as by being disintegrated, taken to the Positive Energy Plane, or thrown into the heart of a volcano.",12800

Gray Nisp,8,fey,temperate or warm waters,"This creature resembles a hairless humanoid with smooth, slick skin; its hands and feet are webbed and end in claws, and its face has large, dark pupilless eyes. It has no noses or ears, and its small fishlike mouth is filled with tiny, sharp teeth.","Nisps are a race of waters-based fey creatures that dwell in swamps, rivers, lakes, and seas. They are aggressive hunters and dine on anything they can catch and kill. Gray nisps dwell in deeper waters, in caves on the oceans floor or hollows at the bottom of sizeable lakes. They are isolative and territorial. They are also smart enough to realize how dim they are, and this realization makes them irritable and unpredictable. They have a keen sense of smell, and immediately investigate creatures that stray too close to their lair. Their curiosity usually takes the form of pulling apart intruders to see how they are built. Though technically sentient, nisps do not reason the way most creatures do. They have no concept of love, duty, or hatred, though they do seem capable of nearly insatiable curiosity and malice. This fearsome creature is 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a white underbelly, and weighs well over 300 pounds. It has large, wicked talons and an unusually large mouth, filled with dagger-like teeth. Gray nisps surprise intruders if they can. They may start with their spell-like powers, or engage directly in melee; they may even attempt to speak with intruders, though their innate stupidity usually results in increasing frustration, and finally a burst into action.

Gray Ooze,4,ooze,cold marshes or underground,"A seemingly mundane puddle, patch of moist stone, or glistening rock is suddenly revealed to be more as a terrible pseudopod lashes out.","Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary marsheslands, or sometimes even dungeons and caverns, gray oozes consume organic materials they encounter. Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marshes pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on. Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by mwho dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history of magical pollution. Variant Gray Oozes The gray ooze adapts readily and swiftly to changes in environments, the simple structure of its primeval form and its method of using fission to reproduce all but ensuring that such changes occur. Listed below are two such variants that adventurers have encountered. Crystal Ooze : The crystal ooze is an waters variant that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found in the gray ooze's beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the waters subtype and a swim speed of 30 ft. The crystal ooze lacks the gray ooze's constrict ability, but it does secrete a paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw . Id Ooze : Perhaps the strangest variant gray oozes are those that have developed a rudimentary intelligence, including the ability to communicate telepathically with other oozes, or even the ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw mental power. Id oozes are advanced gray oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 , can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes within 100 feet via telepathy, and can use lesser confusion at will as a spell-like ability .",1200
Gray Render,8,magical beast,temperate marshes,"This hulking beast has slick, gray, hairless skin. Its numerous yellow eyes and wide toothy maw are its only facial features.","Standing over 9 feet tall and weighing in excess of 4,000 pounds, a gray render is a solitary and savage predator. Renders are gifted with immense strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding within. Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely. Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamps. The render acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they attack it. Most animal ""pets"" grow to accept its presence, and primitive humanoid ""pets"" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the gods. A render's bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years, after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites. Renders are generally not malicious, and only attack if hungry or if they or their pets are threatened. A render protecting its pets fights to the death.",4800

In their eyes blaze endless possibilities for bloodshed and terror, their myopic gazes seeming to witness the potential for infinite deaths and devastations hidden within each moment. Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages are usually loners, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in minstances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak these cyclopes with veils of menace and dark legends. Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them-desertsed islands, high craggy mountains, and stoic hills countries often provide the great caves they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands, spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals.

At the center of the creature's front is a circular opening that leads into its interior.","These gigantic but primitive life forms feed on sea life swept near them, and may pose a threat to anyone unlucky enough to move within their threat range. In rocky areas, a great sea anemone has a green interior. These horrors lurk in areas near the surface of the waters, where tidal currents sweep waters laden with fish across their surfaces. Great sea anemones in the open are easily spotted and avoided, but they sometimes lurk at the end of rocky channels or around bends, whereupon they pose a hazard to unwary undersea travelers. In addition to being found in reefs and shoals, mundersea races harvest these creatures when young and plant them in or near their lairs to serve as sentinels against unwanted intrusion. Care must be taken in this process, for the anemone is very difficult to train, and may well snack on the very creatures who cultivated it. The great sea anemone is immobile. Great sea anemones snag anything large enough that comes within their reach with their tendrils. Once their intended victim stops struggling, it is drawn into the anemone's interior, where it is digested. If injured it withdraws its body into its rubbery trunk, and if badly injured it expels the contents of its stomach in a cloud of acid. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800

It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a waters elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that emits wisps of smoke. Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools when combating foes.

One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground.

These creatures feed on bone marrow and their lairs are always scattered with leg bones, arm bones, spinal columns and the like from once living creatures; both humanoid and animal. They make their lairs deep underground and avoid natural daylight, though some brave the surface world and venture from their lairs at night. These creatures rarely foray into the outside world, so such encounters are rare, and will always be with more than one boneneedle. Boneneedles tend to congregate in clusters or packs and a typical lair can contain mof these creatures. They have no social structure and simply rely on one another for hunting and feeding. Any young boneneedles present are generally nonthreatening as they lack the deadly mandibles that adults possess. Boneneedles are bloated, yellowish-white blobs of rubbery flesh with spidery legs of black or gold. The mandibles are glossy-black and hollow, and aid the boneneedle in piercing its prey's flesh and bone and siphoning off its meal. When feeding, the boneneedle's fleshy form pulsates and expands. After feeding, its form becomes less translucent and takes on a sickly yellow color. Boneneedles are highly aggressive and opportunistic hunters. Using their coloration, they hide among the piles of bones in their lair and wait for living creatures to wander close by. When prey comes within range, the boneneedle darts from its hiding place and bites. If subjected to natural daylight, boneneedles flee from the source of the light in the most direct route possible.

Its head is crocodilian with razor-sharp teeth, and its humanoid body appears as an oozy and swirling black mass.","Greater ooze demons attack using their slams or bite and claw attacks. They like to grab a foe and hold on, pulling it close to their body where they subject it to their acid damage. They are not afraid of charging straight into melee, as unaware opponents soon discover their weapons dissolve upon contacting the demon's oozy form. Thereafter, the ooze demon vomits on its foes, an act that revolts most foes, much to the delight of the greater ooze demon. Greater ooze demons stand 12 feet tall but can reach heights of 20 feet or more. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Jim Collura.",12800
Greater Positive Energy Elemental,10,outsider,Positive Energy Plane,This creature appears as a shimmering and wavering sphere of brilliant white energy with small motes of light winking in and out of existence along its spherical form.,"Positive energy elementals are creatures of pure positive energy. They are found primarily on the Positive Energy Plane, but on rare occasions, one slips through a portal or is summoned to the Material Plane. These creatures seem to be able to communicate with others of their kind by changing the intensity of energy in their bodies and altering their shape ever so slightly. Positive energy elementals hate negative energy elementals and always attack them on sight. Aside from that, positive energy elementals rarely engage in combat. If confronted however and forced into battle, the creature responds by pummeling its foes with its powerful fists dealing positive energy to its foe. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600

Greater Verduous Ooze,11,ooze,temperate forests or plains,"A pool of greenish muck, blossoming with weird vegetable-like growths and sap-seeping boils, twitches into unnatural motion as a pseudopod springs outward, dragging the entire grotesque mass forward with an ameboid life.","Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again. Ecology Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds, mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3 years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural gases from the land. As mas 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months. Habitat & Society Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and junglesenvironments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass, flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed. Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes' relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close. Greater Verdurous Ooze Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.",12800

Green Hag,5,monstrous humanoid,temperate marshes,"Knots of dark, moldering hair spill over the features of this sickly, thin, green-skinned crone.","Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions-for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast. A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds. Hag Covens When three hags of type gather, they can form a coven to gain increased magical ability. Any combination of hags can form a coven, but green hags are the most common members of such foul gatherings. Whenever all three hags of a particular coven are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use of the following spell-like abilities: animate dead, baleful polymorph , blight , bestow curse , clairaudience/clairvoyance, charm monster , commune, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana , reincarnate, speak with dead, veil , vision. All three hags must take a fullround action to take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 9th . The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if with a Charisma score of 16 unless one of the hags has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that hag's Charisma modif ier. At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful hag covens might have additional spell-like abilities.",1600

They shoot first and eat later. Greenskins are a wicked orcish species of arboreal hunters. More stealthy and agile than their common cousins they are slighter of build but suffer no penalties from daylight or bright light. They are generally open and friendly to other evil humanoid races and often set up trade routes with said creatures. They make their homes among the dense foliage of the forests building their wooden huts from the trees and branches. Some tribes even build their entire village among the treetops . Greenskin orcs stand about 6 feet tall. Females are slightly smaller. Hair color is always black or greenish-black. Eye color varies, but is usually dark brown, dark green, or occasionally deep, rich blue. Greenskins are highly proficient in the use stealth and surprise, attacking with their ranged weapons when an enemy is sighted. They seek to disable and weaken foes with arrows before closing to finish the job with their wicked longswords. Greenskin Orc Society Greenskins tend to get along well with most other species of orcs being smart enough to take orders and wise enough to keep their mouths shut. They often serve roles in mixed tribes as scouts and skirmishers. Greenskins are mortal enemies of elves and the bane of fey and enchanted woodland creatures. They torture such beings mercilessly should they manage to take one alive. Despite their skill with the longbow, greenskin warriors are equally proficient with the longsword and hunting knife. Greenskins tend to hunt in packs, using their scent ability to track their quarry. Their hunting packs are competitive with one another, each member seeking to be the one to make the kill. Greenskins are likely to have 1d2 trained worgs among them. Greenskin lairs often have as mas two dozen of these foul creatures living and sleeping amongst their masters filthy sleeping rags. Greenskin tribes are known to hire themselves out to civilized masters as scouts and even irregular and regular missile units. They are also likely to serve evil druids and despotic ranger lords. Greenskin Orc Characters Greenskin leaders tend to be rangers or druids. Greenskin orcs pay homage to ""He of the One Eye"" or a nature god local to the area.

Gremlin,0.5,fey,land,"This creature resembles a goblin with long floppy ears, a pinched wrinkled face, nasty claws, a mouth full of sharp teeth and a wicked glint to its eyes.","Gremlins are wicked fey beings who revel in destruction and creating mayhem. They are known to wreck machinery and equipment, often laying nasty traps behind, insuring that repair is next to impossible. Due to their phase door ability they can get inside even the most complicated and tight areas without fear of detection and remain as long as they like. Here they reside undetected until towers begin collapsing, forges explode, gates jam, and catapults begin to misfire. Once a village, city, or castle finds itself the unhappy host of a gremlin, it is almost impossible to root the creature out and remove it once and for all. Individual gremlins tend to scout out new areas in which to wreak havoc. Within weeks their numbers double, especially in high population areas where they may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A gremlin stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds. When pressed into combat, gremlins fight with bites, claws and their wicked blades which are frequently slick with nasty venoms. They prefer to hide in shadows and lash out with their sneak attack and use their phase door ability to beat a hasty retreat. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",200
Greruor Demon,10,outsider,any,"This creature appears as a massive, squat and bloated frog-like creature with arms in place of its forelegs. Two large horns protrude above deep sunken eyes.","Greruors serve in the infernal armies of several demon lords, particularly Tsathogga. They are strong, powerful, and brutal demons that delight in inflicting pain on others. They are extremely loyal and follow orders without question. Some greater demons, like nalfeshnees and glabrezus, relish the flesh of greruors' legs and often organize hunting parties to track and slay the frog demons. The greruors however are not the weak-minded brutes they appear to be and often win such confrontations using their deadly ranseurs and their large numbers to turn back their opponents. A greruor appears as a massive, squat, bloated, frog-like demon with arms in place of its forelegs. Its wide, frog-like head has two 3-foot long horns protruding just above its deep, sunken eyes. It moves by hopping on its rear legs. Its arms end in talons which are usually clutched around the greruor's deadly ranseur. Its huge mouth sports razor-sharp teeth of a dull gray color. The greruor stands about 8 feet tall when on all fours. In combat, they stand on their hind legs and attack with their ranseur. The greruor's flesh is greenish-brown mottled with red or gray. Its skin constantly oozes and secretes a thick, mucus-like clear slime that is slick to the touch. Greruors enjoy combat and seek it wherever they can find it. Normally they rely on their natural attacks, spittle, and weapons to fell opponents. If outmatched, they use confusion to disorient opponents, followed closely by shatter. Grabbed opponents are often held in the mouth of one greruor while another stabs the victim with its ranseur. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600
Grick,3,aberration,underground,"This pallid, slimy, worm-like creature is the size of a human, its mouth a sickening tangle of tentacles and hooked jaws.","The worm-like grick is a terror of the caverns and tunnels in which it dwells, lying in wait near heavily traveled underground passages or subterranean cities for the chance to reach forth from the darkness and take its prey. Those laid low by a grick are rarely consumed on the spot. Instead, fresh food is hauled back to the grick's lair in a tight burrow or high on a cavern ledge, where it is consumed in small bites at the grick's leisure. The origins of the grick are not known. Even though the grick has a rudimentary intelligence, it does not have society to speak of, and most are encountered alone. On those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple specimens, groups of gricks do not appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks individual targets and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous. Mnovice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they were unable to damage the creature with their nonmagical weapons. Those that are familiar with gricks  know the best strategy for dealing with them is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements. Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions when food is scarce in a given region, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but these sojourns are almost always out of necessity, and end as soon as the gricks find entrances to new subterranean lairs. They prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead, avoiding the open skies and going to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead. junglesGricks These surface-adapted varieties of the underground grick are shades of green and lurk in the undergrowth of jungles or climb low-hanging branches to drop on unsuspecting prey.

Griffon,4,magical beast,temperate hills,"This majestic beast has the body of a lion, the head and forelegs of a great eagle, and a massive pair of feathered wings.","Griffons are powerful aerial predators, swooping down from their high aeries to take their prey with beak and talon. Aggressive and territorial, they are no mere beasts, but rather calculating combatants and loyal companions to those who earn their respect, fighting to the death to protect their friends and kin. Weighing in at over 500 pounds and measuring 8 feet long from hooked beak to tufted tail, the griffon strikes an imposing silhouette that has long been used in heraldry and other iconography as a symbol of power, authority, and justice. In reality, the griffon is less concerned with abstract concepts than with hunting food and protecting its own. While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conf lict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food-horse flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained griffon's stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts' hunting shrieks split the skies. Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years to take vengeance over a slain mate or child. It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a griffon's allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord  is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount. Before it can be ridden in combat, a griffon requires practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward its trainer . After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common. Griffons can carry up to 300 pounds as a light load, 600 pounds as a medium load, and 900 pounds as a heavy load. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle.",1200
Grig,1,fey,temperate forests,"Perched on the prickly legs of a cricket, this tiny creature has gossamer wings and the upper body of an elven woman.","Grigs are tiny fey with the upper bodies of elf-like sprites and cricket bodies below. Their humanoid features vary wildly in individual appearance, but they usually wear their brown, silver, or green hair long and uncombed. In most cases, grigs' skin bears gold or green stripes or markings, and their legs are brightly colored. They prefer to eschew clothes entirely, wearing clothing only when such apparel has desirable magical effects. Grigs stand 1-1/2 feet tall, and weigh just under 10 pounds. Grigs make their homes in thick woods alongside rolling hills, often near bodies of waters. In every grig community may be found a clearing where the group observes the moon during its mlunar holidays. Despite their tiny size, grigs are eager to confront evil and vanquish ugliness-as a result, grigs often find themselves in trouble. They rarely attack directly, instead preferring the element of surprise. In combat, grigs maintain their distance and either depend on their spell-like abilities or fire their longbows from afar. Grigs use their movement to their advantage, frequently jumping about their enemies or flying beyond their reach. Gigs excel at music, and can create lively ditties simply by sawing their legs against their bodies. Grig music often stirs people to dance, even when the grigs don't enhance their music with supernatural compulsions. In addition to loving music, grigs enjoy the visual arts, especially paintings and sketches, and they often decorate their homes with bright colors and delightful images.",400
Grig Swarm,6,fey,temperate forests,Winged man-shaped creatures with blue skin and cricket legs buzz about in a dense mass both hypnotic and frightening.,"A grig swarm is a large mass of flying grigs. Normally grigs don't gather into groups larger than 80 or so creatures. But sometimes when several tribes come together, they join as a grig swarm. The individual grigs that make up the swarm have light blue skin, forests-green hair, and brown hairy legs, and usually wear tunics or brightly colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. A grig stands 1-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound. A grig swarm normally attacks by surrounding and enveloping its opponents. Before closing to melee range, a swarm uses its entangle ability to bind its foes. If facing destruction, a swarm often turns invisible and flees. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400
Grim Reaper,20,undead,any,"This tall, cloaked figure stares out from the black hood that covers its head. It wields an enormous scythe in its skeletal, bone-white hands, looking as though it is freezing the very air around it.","Known by mnames throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves. While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master's dreadful will and meet out death's unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds. Ecology Grim reapers have no creator and are not born by definition of the word-they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does. Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized death's terminal permanency. Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper. While similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed. Habitat & Society While grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in their endeavors. Among their mpowers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals. These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding. While stripped of their more powerful brethren's necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective. Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary. If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets. Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm. Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell create greater undead.",307200

Its mouth is wide and large and sports double rows of razor-sharp fangs. A purplish-black tongue flicks in and out of its mouth. The monster's powerful arms and legs end in filthy wicked claws that sport broken, black fingernails.","A grimm is perhaps one of the most evil of all fey. Conceived and created by members of the Unseelie Court, the monster's only purpose seems to be the destruction of life and that which is beautiful. Legends among the fairy folk say powerful members of the Unseelie Court  created this fell beast to avenge the death of their own who were slain in battle when the Unseelie Court and Seelie Court did battle. Grimms dwell in the deepest and darkest mountains making their lairs in deep recesses or hard to access caves and caverns, venturing forth only to kill and to eat. Grimms prefer a diet of meat, particularly good-aligned fey creatures, but they are not particularly picky and will gladly eat anything  that crosses their path. Slain prey that is not immediately eaten is stored in the grimm's lair for later consumption. These creatures are highly territorial and do not associate with other creatures, not even their own kind. A grimm stands 9 feet tall and weighs in excess of 1,200 pounds. Stout and powerfully built, its body teems with muscle and is always covered in a glossy sheen. A grimm opens combat slashing with its claws and gnashing with its terrible bite. If it can grab a foe, it does so, pinning it and draining its strength in order to increase its own. If fairing poorly, a grimm employs its spell-like abilities and blur special ability. Against overwhelming odds, a grimm shifts to the Ethereal Plane to avoid its foes. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",25600
Grimstalker,5,fey,forests,"This creature looks like a hairless elf, slender and graceful, with long arms that end in sharp claws. Its skin is brown and woody and resembles tree bark. It wears clothes made of leaves and vines.","The grimstalker or banaan  is a fey creature that does not share the beauty and goodness of its kin. Whereas other fey creatures have come to represent the beautiful or mischievous side of nature, the grimstalker most certainly reflects nature at its worst. They are dark creatures, their hearts tainted with the foulest of evil. Unfortunate souls that wander into a forests guarded by grimstalkers are never seen again-except for their skulls, which the grimstalkers hang from the trees as a warning to those that would dare trespass into their domain. Long thought to be a form of intelligent plant because of their mplant-like features, grimstalkers skulk among the trees of the darkest forests. Even among sylvan communities of elves the grimstalkers are legendary as natural born assassins. Grimstalkers sometimes work with other evil fey such as redcaps ; though such alliances are short and very rare, especially with the malevolent and untrustworthy redcap. It is rumored that powerful evil druids often summon grimstalkers for nefarious purposes. Grimstalkers strike from ambush if possible, hiding among the trees and dropping on interlopers into their forests. A troupe of grimstalkers that set up an ambush make ample use of the terrain, as well as nets woven from living vines, snares, and pit traps. Grimstalkers also employ trained plant creatures such as assassin vines and scythe trees. In melee they are capable of fighting with their claws or with weapons-their favorite weapons being a sort of spiked quarterstaff and longbows knocked with poisoned arrows.

Grindylow,0.5,aberration,waters,"With a large head and numerous teeth, this unsightly creature resembles a goblin from the waist up and a greasy octopus below.","About 4 feet long from head to tentacle tip, grindylows appear to be half-goblin and half-octopus, the split occurring at the waist. Grindylows are violent, ravenous creatures that use their spears to hunt or just to poke at things that scream and cry. While grindylows resemble goblins, they are not humanoid creatures. Nonetheless, these waters monsters are just as wicked as the most sadistic of goblins, and take immense pleasure in others' misfortunes and the spread of mayhem. Thanks to this twisted desire, grindylows have a nasty reputation among both other intelligent waters-dwelling creatures and most land-dwelling beings. Grindylows eat whatever they can kill, giving them a rather wide selection of meals. High or low, no one is safe from the brutish assaults; tribes of merfolk have been overwhelmed by bands of grindylows, as have galleons full of experienced sailors. While obvious predators such as giant eels or sharks evoke great fear from grindylows, no enemies are more hated than the squid, be it common or giant. None are sure where this disdain stems from, but it is speculated that a squid is to an octopus for a grindylow what a dog is to a goblin dog for goblins. Incredibly fond of their similarly designed kin, grindylows believe octopuses to be the epitome of beauty, with squids being regarded as hideous freaks in comparison. There is no greater insult to a grindylow than being called a squid. While grindylows can take class levels to gain power, certain grindylows are freakish throwbacks to a primal age- these grindylows never cease growing, and in time can become massive beasts of Huge size. Unlike the typical grindylow, these giants can attack with all six of their tentacles and constrict with great effect. Giant grindylows are fortunately quite rare.",200

The bulbous sac on its spine is an extradimensional space that can contain thousands of gallons of waters. The creature drains waters  from one place and releases it in another, typically creating boggy areas as it moves so it can travel more quickly than its tentacles can carry it. A grodair can rise up to 6 feet on its tentacles, measures 7 feet long, and weighs about 400 pounds. A grodair is intelligent, but extremely absentminded and careless.

Gronk,3,monstrous humanoid,cold plains,The most notable feature of the hairy humanoid is large curved horn projecting from the forehead. The creature's thick limbs and torso betray its muscular power.,"Gronks are the typical big, dumb brutes; a male gronk is on average approximately 9 feet tall, with females only slightly smaller. A gronk has mottled gray skin and shaggy brown hair that is thickest at its head and shoulders and gradually thins out around its waist. The arms and legs of a gronk are massive, like tree limbs attached to its thick barrel-like torso. The face of a gronk seems almost lost amid the long hair hanging from its head. The most notable feature of a gronk's face is the long, rhinoceros-like horn between its eyes. Gronks dwell in small family bands or nomadic packs. They are huntergatherers, wandering the cold plains they call home. Gronk packs never remain in one place for more than a month before moving on to greener pastures and better hunting grounds. They have been known to engage in barter with traders who cross their territories. Of particular interest to gronks are frost giants, with whom they have some sort of kinship or bond . Gronks are fiercely territorial, but will not attack strangers who are simply passing through. They know how long it should take to cross their lands, and anyone remaining there for longer than that is subject to a raid. During such raids, gronks often subdue rather than kill their opponents. Subdued opponents are left to fend for themselves in the wild while the gronks carry off their gear and supplies. The only creatures that are immediately attacked when they enter gronk lands are orcs. There is some ancient enmity between the two races that forces a gronk to attack orc or half-orc on sight. Such creatures are never shown quarter in combat and all battles between a gronk and orc or half-orc ends when one or the other dies. Gronks enjoy combat and enter into melee with unashamed glee. They can fight either armed or unarmed, and actually prefer the latter. Among weapons, gronks tend to use simple weapons such as clubs. They rarely use missile weapons of kind. Gronk Characters Gronks have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Most gronk leaders are barbarians. On rare occasions, a female gronk becomes an adept or druid; female gronks are the only members of their race who have ever shown skill with magic. Gronk characters have the following racial traits. +8 Strength, +6 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Gronks display the strength, ferocity and dull wits of the typical savage.

Grootslang,16,magical beast,tropical lakes or rivers or underground,"This enormous creature has the broad chest and massive forelimbs of a bull elephant, but its hindquarters bleed seamlessly into a serpentine body thicker than an oak tree. Its viperlike head is flanked by a thicket of sharp tusks, between which an eerily nimble tongue flicks back and forth.","Grootslangs are cruel, deadly creatures that inhabit tropical waters and deep caves. They have the broad chest and front legs of an elephant, but their lower half tapers to a long, snakelike tail. A grootslang's head has the diamond shape of a viper's, but three adjacent pairs of tusks sprout from either side of its jaws and small, leaf-shaped ears crown its skull. The grootslang's leathery hide has a metallic sheen and a dull copper color, with green veins throughout. Males and females grow to a length of 60 feet, standing 20 feet tall. Little differentiation exists between sexes save for a lighter green hue to the female's hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons and live up to 500 years. Ecology Legends claim that the grootslang is a primordial creature as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those days the gods-new to the crafting of things-made a terrible mistake in the grootslang's creation, for they had given it tremendous strength, cunning, and intellect. Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of their original creations escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs have come. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome reputation is well deserved. All grootslangs are carnivorous and require hundreds of pounds of meat per meal to sustain themselves. At home on land or in waters, they feed on large herd animals like zebras and elephants or on hippos and even small whales. Grootslangs' ability to travel large distances at great speed prevents them from over-hunting one region; their metabolism being more reptilian than mammalian, they feed roughly once a week. Although intelligent humanoids are too small to provide adequate nourishment, grootslangs delight in eating such creatures as it satisfies their appetite for cruelty. Stories are told throughout the Mwangi Expanse of grootslangs that ambush boats, small and large, offering to spare the vessels only if the passengers vote to throw one of their own to the creature as a meal. The grootslangs then watch as the agonizing decision is made. In rare instances, the grootslangs do not even eat the victims but let the entire crew go to live with the burden of their choice. All grootslangs covet gems, particularly diamonds, and despite the creatures' lust for cruelty, victims can sometimes bargain for their freedom in exchange for large quantities of precious stones. Such deals must be carefully negotiated, however, as grootslangs have no compunctions about honoring their word and are just as likely to take the offered gems and then still eat those who offered them. Habitat & Society Grootslangs are solitary creatures and do not join with other members of their kind, even for mating. A grootslang's famous love of gems is actually tied to the creature's reproduction and not its avaricious nature. A female lays a single egg once every 50 years. When the female is ready to produce her egg, she ingests all of the gemstones she has amassed since producing her last egg. The digestion of the stones couples with the production of the egg, creating an egg that is slightly translucent, but as hard as stone. She then deposits it in a deep, dark corner of a body of waters where it awaits fertilization. The egg emits a strong scent that diffuses into the waters and alerts passing males to its presence. Once a male detects the egg, the male also ingests a portion of its own cache of gemstones and then returns to fertilize the egg. As with the female, the male's consumption of the gems interacts with his reproductive system, and once the male has fertilized the egg, a second translucent and durable coating encases the now-gestating offspring within. Over a 2-year period, the embryonic grootslang develops, while the crystalline surface of the egg lets light and sound filter through to orient the embryo to its surroundings even before it hatches. Once sufficiently grown, the young grootslang begins to punch its way through the egg, sometimes needing a month or more to crack the egg's hardened surface. A hatchling grootslang is roughly the size of an adult crocodile, but needs another decade to reach full physical maturity. Reproductive maturity is achieved roughly 1 century after hatching.",76800
Gryph,1,magical beast,temperate forests or underground,"This hawk-sized avian looks much like a six-legged stork. Its feathers are unkempt and greasy, and its beak is razor-sharp.","Gryphs are bird-like creatures usually found underground, but they also favor dark and tangled forests. Gryphs normally survive on carrion and small animals, but take on larger game when driven by hunger or if they feel threatened. Most disturbing is their means of reproduction. Gryphs are hermaphroditic and mate frequently, such that their egg pouches are rarely empty. When they encounter a suitable host-a warm-blooded creature of size Small or larger, ideally alone-the gryphs swoop down, latch on to the target, and implant their eggs directly into its flesh. As long as the target is conscious, the flock continues its assault, though if the target flees the area, the gryphs return to their nest. The eggs quicken swiftly once implanted, and gryph chicks hatch forth mere minutes later in a bloody birth that is often fatal to the host. Gryphs have a strange affinity for vermin, often lairing in close proximity to one or more insect swarms or vermin of Medium size or smaller. The insects avoid the gryphs instinctively, feeding off the remains of the flock's meals and on creatures too small for the gryphs to bother with. Most gryphs have six legs, but some have four or even eight. Individual flocks are always made up of gryphs with the same number of limbs. A gryph is 3 feet tall and weighs 45 pounds.",400
Guardian Daemon,6,outsider,any,"This entity resembles a large bipedal bear-like creature with upward curving horns, elongated fangs, and blackish-gray fur. Its hands end in eagle-like talons.","Summoning a Guardian Daemon A guardian daemon can be summoned by a planar ally, greater planar ally, planar binding, greater planar binding or similar magic that allows a spellcaster to bring an outsider to the Material Plane. A guardian daemon is summoned to the Material Plane by a spellcaster with the task of guarding an area or treasure. These daemons vary in size and appearance, though most resemble large bears, wild cats, or apes with added daemonic characteristics . Despite its varying appearance and form, the guardian daemon is a dangerous adversary. A typical guardian daemon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Most guardian daemons are of neutral slant, though many, due to their daemonic heritage, are evil and usually only serve those of like alignment. A guardian daemon only initiates combat if the area it is guarding is entered or the treasure it is watching over is disturbed. Though guardian daemons can move both upright and on all fours, it always fights in a bipedal stance. When engaged in combat, it may move freely, but never leaves the area it is guarding . A guardian daemon attacks using its breath weapon, bite, and claws. It defends the area it is tied to until either it or its opponents are dead.

Guardian Naga,10,aberration,temperate plains,"A contemplative humanoid face framed by a cobra-like hood adorns the body of this long, brightly colored serpent.","Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobralike hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic junglessnakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds. While mguardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder-towering watersfalls, natural spires, mountainstop temples-minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.",9600
Guecubu,8,undead,any,"A skeletal carcass pulls itself from the ground, its body formed as much from earth and soil as from bones and rotting flesh.","Often when a particularly evil criminal is executed, suspicious folk fear that the criminal's remains might rise from death to continue to plague the living. To combat this possibility, mmobs or rural justices take to the practice of burning the bodies, grinding the bones, and scattering the remains in the wild. Yet in the case of particularly evil criminals, even these steps are in vain, for their will is enough to reassemble a body from earth, stone, roots, and plants drawn from the region into which the remains were scattered. Such an undead horror rises as a guecubu, a harbinger of misfortune and vengeance from beyond the grave. A newly formed guecubu remembers well how its enemies treated it, and while the undead creature retains none of its previous life's talents, its undead state grants it mnew tools to seek revenge with. Typically, a guecubu does not limit its revenge to those directly involved with its execution-entire villages and towns fall victim to its rage. The guecubu's tactics tend toward the subtle, and it seeks to spread misfortune and death on a person-by-person basis, slaying its enemies one at a time until they flee, so that all that remains is a ghost town. A guecubu is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.",4800
Gug,10,aberration,underground,"This towering menace has a horrible, vertically aligned mouth and arms that split at the elbows into twin clawed hands.","Gugs are inhuman monstrosities that dwell in the deep places of the world. Whether they were banished to the dark lands by ancient gods or the light-loving races they terrorized, or perhaps were brought to the deep realms by dark powers from some even more inhuman nightmare realm, is unknown, but gugs are loathed by other races for their carnal rites of slaughter. Gugs are 16 feet tall and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, but they move with an eerie, unnatural gait as though their limbs contained far too mjoints. They can contort and distend their limbs for greater reach or to wriggle easily through impossibly small passages. Gugs may cling for long hours to cave walls or just within dark side-caverns, lying in wait for prey to stumble too close. Their senses are keen, however, and their joy in the bloody hunt is considerable and gugs who catch the scent of blood may stalk their prey for long days, even venturing at times beyond their caves to dare the bright lands of the surface in search of tasty meat to drag back for their horrific sacrifices. Gugs are savage fighters when driven by a strong leader, but on their own may flee if brought to fewer than half their hit points, carrying off fresh meat for later feasting if they are able. They can subsist on fungi, slimes, and molds as well as carrion and even undead flesh-particularly that of ghouls. Some bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their alien patrons. These monsters are known as savants. They have a Charisma of 18 and can use invisibility, spike stones, transmute rock to mud, and unholy blight once per day each as spell-like abilities .

The gulper eel spends its life eating giant shrimp, and other creatures which happen to arouse its senses. Gulper eels spend most of their lives in the deepest and darkest parts of the oceans, rarely if ever venturing near the surface waters. Solitary creatures by nature, during mating season , it is common to find a pair of these creatures dwelling together. During mating season, the female deposits her eggs  in the dirt and mass of plants on the oceans floor. Within two months the eggs hatch and the young swim free. Young are independent within 2 weeks after birth and venture out on their own shortly thereafter. A gulper eel averages 10 feet in length but can grow to reach 30 feet or more. Its body is long, sleek, and black in color and its tail ends in a luminous organ. Its eyes are small for its body and close to its snout. It massive mouth is lined with rows of sharpened teeth. Gulper eels attempt to bite their prey, holding it before swallowing it whole. Because a gulper eel can unhinge its jaw and stretch its stomach, it can swallow opponents larger than itself.

"Hag, Annis",6,monstrous humanoid,cold marshes,"This repulsive, hunchbacked crone has skin the color of a fresh bruise. Despite her hunch, she looms taller than a human.","Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds. Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking-often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp. Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims  for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads  handy to return to the victims' parents, for example-often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death. Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though mprove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis-typically horrible triplets-are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles.",2400
Hala,4,outsider,any,"Skin the color of thunderheads and wings made for soaring through the most violent winds mark this lean, cyclopic being as a master of terrible storms. The sound of shrieking wind emanates from its mouth full of needle-sharp teeth.","Hala demons are commonly known as storm demons. Bound to service by Pazuzu, these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single, blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy horns growing from their heads. A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large wings that span 20 feet across. Ecology Hala demons form from covetous souls, those who desired the possessions of others so much so that they indulged in such acts as murder, theft, or blackmail. The more persons harmed by these desires, the more likely the soul is to become a hala in the Abyss. Halas are masters of the winds, harnessing the power of storms, redirecting and amplifying that energy to cause the most damage and chaos possible. They relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm's energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds also aids them in flight. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents around them. Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will often refer to the storm clouds they marshesal as ""my storm."" A hala is predisposed to grab item it finds particularly desirable, and will actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from others remains so prevalent in the hala's nature that it often carries large sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its flights. Bags of holding or handy haversacks are highly prized possessions to a hala, as it allows it to pillage even more items. Halas are voracious, with large mouths that open nearly ear-to-ear. Edible items they find in their pillaging are often consumed immediately. This includes a particular appetite for children and other Small humanoids. Habitat & Society Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force. Their heaviest concentration, however, exists in High M'Vania, as all hala demons are required to return to Pazuzu's realm once a century to report all that they have observed. Despite the duty to return to High M'Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated, remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains. Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountains range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forests or swamps. While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures: eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the eagle's territory and offspring. Dragons-of breed-largely view the storm demons as a danger to their own hoards of treasure, for if a hala discovers the dragon's lair, it will stop at nothing to possess all that lies within it.",1200

It wears tattered skins over a suit of hide armor.,"Half-ogres are rare crossbreeds of human and ogre. Standing a few feet shorter than their ogre kin and a few feet taller than their human kin, half-ogres have strength as well as speed and intelligence  in their favor. Their skin and hair color generally match that of their ogre parent, with dark tones such as gray, brown, or olive being the most prevalent. Half-ogres speak Common. Those with an Intelligence score of at least 10 also speak Giant. A half-ogre's usual weapon of choice is a greatsword or a longspear. They sometimes employ longswords and large wooden shields. Half-Ogre Society Half-ogres, though generally outcasts among humans and feared for their ugliness and size, can find some acceptance among ogres. Half-ogres in an ogre band need to prove themselves constantly to their larger kin, however. For this reason, half-ogres found among an ogre band are cruel, violent, and strong; weaker half-ogres usually wind up in the stew pot. Most half-ogres found among full-blooded ogres are leaders of the ogre band or are at least well on their way to becoming leaders. Their long years suffering the harsh treatment of their kin help half-ogres develop a sense of cunning and a strong will to survive. Therefore, ogres under the leadership of a half-ogre fight more effectively, even engaging in planned ambushes and complicated tactics that are beyond most ogres. On rare occasions, half-ogres collect into hybrid communities of other half-ogre races  or humanoids . These rogue bands of outcasts form bandit clans or marauding groups that are the bane of other humanoid communities in their area. Half-ogre Characters Half-ogres possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels. Halfogres have the following racial traits. +6 Strength, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma. Halfogres are fierce warriors, but weak minded. Darkvision: Half-ogres can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: A half-ogre begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. Racial Skills: A half-ogre's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x . Racial Feats: A half-ogre's humanoid levels give it one feat. AC: +2 natural armor bonus. Weapon proficiency: A half-ogre is proficient with the greatsword and all simple weapons. Special Qualities: Ogre blood . Languages: Half-ogres begin play speaking Common, and can also speak giant if they have an Intelligence of at least 10. Half-ogres with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Orc, Goblin, Troll Credit The Half-Ogre originally appeared in Dragon #29  and is used by permission.

Hand of the Inheritor,15,outsider,good-aligned plane,"This masculine, golden-skinned angel stands taller than the greatest human champion. His halo is a spinning wheel of blades above his head, and with a gesture it flies to his left arm like a deadly spiked shield, while great wings of brilliant energy manifest from his back.","The Hand of the Inheritor is a warrior angel, first to answer Iomedae's call whenever she must directly intervene on Golarion. As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be color, though he does not actually need them to fly. The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and Iomedae rarely calls upon him when the situation requires someone willing to mince words. He once served the Empyreal Lord Ragathiel  but asked to serve Iomedae after Aroden died, as she needed a hero to be her champion. Ecology The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans. He refers to Iomedae as ""My Lady, the Just Queen of Heaven,"" and treats her as if he were a knight holding a chaste adoration for a righteous courtly lady. His haloshield is called the Brightsword, and he sometimes refers to it as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a free action he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him. Habitat & Society The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed on Golarion, he guards noble souls through the Astral to Pharasma's court, patrols the borders of Iomedae's realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness. He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making. Though he is actually older than Iomedae, he defers to her divine wisdom and experience as a mortal, for he understands his perspective as an immortal angel living in the realms beyond Golarion is very different and sometimes emotionally distant from the thoughts and concerns of humanity. He is an ally of the heralds of Sarenrae and Shelyn, but is wary of the herald of Cayden Cailen, for that one's overt sexuality makes him slightly uncomfortable . Heralds of the Gods: Revisited The Hand of the Inheritor stands among a special class of unique, godly servants known as heralds. With few exceptions, every one of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes and upon the mortal realm. While not necessarily the most powerful of a deity's minions, heralds embody fundamental elements of a god's faiths and philosophies, and thus prove particularly suited to interactions with mortal worshipers-although a herald appears only at the direct order of a deity, not merely because a powerful cleric requires aid. Thus, heralds are creatures myth, and their appearances mark lives and events of legend. In the Pathfinder RPG, heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via the spell greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the Hand of the Inheritor. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will. Currently, the statistics for eight heralds have appeared in Pathfinder Adventure Paths, while all of these divine emissaries are described in Pathfinder Chronicles: Gods & Magic.

A rotted noose and several feet of rope hang from its neck and trail off behind it. Its eyes have no pupils.","A hanged man is the restless corpse of an evil humanoid that was hanged or the spirit of one wrongfully accused of a crime and hanged. It is a malevolent and vengeful creature that attacks living creatures on sight. Hanged men are usually encountered near the area where they were killed or in cemeteries, mausoleums, or graveyards where their body was laid to rest. They prey on the living and are found near civilized areas where their food supply is plentiful. Its lair is either its final resting place or a secluded and overgrown area near the place of its death. Its lair is always scattered with the remains of its victims, including treasure a former meal happened to be carrying. A hanged man attacks primarily with its rope, which has become imbued with negative energy and now acts as an extension of the hanged man itself. It uses its rope to capture victims and draw them in where it rips and tears them to shreds with its filthy claws. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",800

Haniver,0.5,fey,temperate coastlines,"This small, bizarre humanoid creature has strange yellow skin and tiny black eyes that burn with malevolence. It grins at its prey with a mouth filled with sharp, needle-like teeth. Its long tail and fins flap around wildly whether it flies through the air or swims through the waters.","Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities, featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme- the gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient youths, and make off with their trinkets. Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories-no matter how unlikely or comic- proves near to the truth. Strange fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping horseshoe crabs, and fatalistically teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would otherwise discard in moments if another creature-or former owner-expresses desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of sense of maliciousness, but merely out of curiosity and selfishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, leaving behind old ""treasures""-often strange or natural items that barely fit the description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it- hence the tendency of fishermen to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing. Hanivers possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds. Ecology Strange beings, even for fey, haniver gremlins bear similarities to both sprites and some breeds of coastlines fish. Their fin-like wings grant them great mobility, both above and below the waves, aiding in their odd habit of flitting in and out of rolling waves. Sets of tiny gills and lungs alike allow them to survive in both environments, making them strangely oblivious to the quandaries of those that cannot. If forced to the ground, a haniver moving along land is a pitiful sight, as it scrabbles its way across the earth with its feeble claws and flops like a fish at the bottom of a boat. Habitat & Society Hanivers rarely travel far from the oceans, preferring the coast both for the comfort of salt waters and for the strange things they often find washed up on beaches.Even though they don't require waters to live, their leathery bodies dry out over time, becoming chafed and stiff. Thus, few hanivers spend more than an hour out of the waters. These gremlins rarely keep lairs or places they call theirs, though most favor small flat underwaters crevices or gaps in sea cliffs on those rare occasions when they feel like sleeping. Some hanivers keep small troves for their treasures, and such nooks might be numerous and place a gremlin deems safe. Often seeming oblivious to others of their kind, or even avoiding them-fleeing from those who might also take a fancy to objects that fascinate them-hanivers occasionally travel together in small mobs. Banding together for safety as they flit across and below coastlines waves, these gremlins can prove incredibly frustrating, even dangerous, should they notice something of interest en masse. Ships at sea, lone fishermen, and even whales and some other forms of large marine life go out of their way to avoid swarms of hanivers. Those that don't risk finding themselves captured amid a storm of inexplicably terrifying, flapping pests, their every possession pilfered by the quick-fingered gremlins. Treasure With no real care for the treasures they collect or interest in items of value, hanivers swipe things based wholly on whether an object strikes their curiosity. Certain objects are guaranteed haniver bait, most specifically object with a lid or flap or anything that shines. As such, chests, packs, boxes, and tents prove irresistible to these gremlins, as do metal arms and armor, coins, gems, lanterns, fishing lures, buttons, sea shells, and the like-the shinier, the better. Additionally, every haniver has its own favorite treasures, and while one might need to claim every new feather it sees, another might obsess over objects that look like they'd make an entertaining noise when dropped from a height. Such fascinations are never malicious, but occasionally lead hanivers to imperil delicate objects or small creatures. On the other hand, hanivers' fixations can sometime prove their undoing, as these thieves' curiosity about closed spaces make these unsuspecting gremlins notoriously easy to capture, and other curiosities might directly lead to messy ends as they attempt to steal from animals, working machinery, or-most commonly-angry humanoids. Hanivers occasionally collect items that prove durable and particularly pleasing. Such treasures they place in outof- the-way hidey-holes, such as underwaters crevices, high tree hollows, and gaps underneath loose shingles. While such collections usually prove worthless, containing only bits of glass, pieces of paper, bent nails, or children's toys, some fishermen tell of the fortunate costermonger whose chimney rained gold-the result of a coin-collecting haniver's poor choice in hiding spots. As Hanivers are widely reviled by sailors and who dwell along the coast, mtown constabularies or old timers hold to an age-old tradition of paying a copper for the body of a haniver. Legends say that the gremlins fear the bodies of their own kind and will avoid house that nails a dead haniver above its door, or the fisherman who carries a haniver corpse amid his tackle. The only problem is that, unless properly prepared and dried , haniver flesh begins to reek terribly about an hour after death, much like the smell of weekold fish. To approximate such gruesome talismans, children in mcoastlines communities enjoy “candied gremlins”-haniver-shaped dried fish or ray covered in salt and sticky sugar.",200
Harbinger Archon,2,outsider,any,"What appears to be a miniaturized orrery zips through the air, with thin, sharp blades flashing periodically from within.","Though counted among the least of the archons, harbingers nonetheless remain steadfast in their dedication to combating evil. These tiny beings serve as heralds and assistants for the forces of Heaven. While on the Material Plane, they advise mortals on how best to serve the causes of order and light. Some even venture to the other Outer Planes as minor ambassadors. Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters' souls toward salvation. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, a lawful good alignment, and be an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a harbinger familiar. A harbinger resembles a whirling mechanical model of a planetary system. Its sun, moons, and planets are crafted of tiny glowing jewels whose color shifts with the harbinger's mood. Electric arcs and sparks of magical essence dance between its whirling pieces. The harbinger can dismantle itself into its component parts to squeeze through tiny gaps, its rings dissolving into glowing vapor while its star and planets remain. Harbingers shed light as brightly as a torch under normal conditions, but can dim to a faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into dancing lights. A harbinger archon's voice resembles the ringing of a dozen tiny bells, and regardless of the language the archon speaks, it retains that tinkling musical quality. Most harbinger archons form from souls that led simple lives of wisdom and piety before their deaths. They remember nothing of their mortal existences, but retain a decidedly practical, if parochial, view of worldly matters. Only rarely does a harbinger want for a parable or proverb apropos to the task at hand.",600
Harpy,4,monstrous humanoid,temperate marshes,"Save for the tattered wings and taloned feet, this creature resembles a feral woman with a wild look about her.","Often viewed as vicious and corrupted creatures, harpies know how creatures think and act.

While creatures of the wild easily fall victim to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women prefer their meals spiced with complex sentient thoughts. Easy prey makes for a boring meal. While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see as potential meals. Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their feathers. For this reason, mharpies wear perfumes and scented oils. Harpies appear wildly different in different lands.

Hekatonkheires,24,outsider,any,"This behemoth looks like a towering humanoid with fifty heads and twice as mhands, each wielding a different weapon.","Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence. When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength- rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely. The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these so-called ""lesser"" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such memories from their ancestors. Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no record of two of these spawn meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is encountered on a world at given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of sort until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago. Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures, especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves. They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if called by their true names, which few-if any-mortals know. Those that do know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems to carry with it immeasurable power. A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came, it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it visited so brief ly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it. Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountains is falling from the skies. In addition to their unworldly strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area.

Hellcat,7,outsider,land,"This eerie beast appears to be the animated skeleton of a huge fanged cat, its bones glowing with fire and seething with smoke.","The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for devils. Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be anyone's pet. On its own, a hellcat prefers to spend its time hunting and stalking prey. While the hellcat, as an outsider, need not eat to survive, it does enjoy eating for pleasure, often leaving significant portions of its kills behind for others to find. A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and example to all those who would deal with their kind. Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies  to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes. The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones. Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The ""fires"" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh.

While individual hellwasps are mindless, when swarmed together they gain a hive mind that torments the living and the dead alike. Sages and diabolists argue as to why this happens, but a favored explanation is that all hellwasps contain the dispersed soul of some greater devil, scattered and imprisoned by his rivals for infractions lost to mortal knowledge. Though intelligent, these swarms are often difficult to understand and reason with. A hellwasp swarm can speak in a fashion with its myriad droning wings. The chatter is often little more than repetitive mantras of insults and the voicing of the twisted and base desires of the swarm. A hellwasp swarm has little use for reason, diplomacy, or discourse in other circumstances, for its desires are as savage as its home plane.",4800
Herald Of Tsathogga,15,aberration,warm marshes,"This creature appears to be a gigantic pale yellow-green frog with oversized monstrous eyes. In place of its legs and forelimbs are mlong, writhing tentacles it uses to pull itself along the ground.","The dark, dismal tropical swamps and fens of the world are home to a horrible creature known only as the herald of Tsathogga. A vaguely froglike thing almost 20 feet across, the herald of Tsathogga is a nightmare creature that is spoken of only in hushed whispers. The creature is believed to have been created by the Frog God as punishment against humanity for wrongdoings done to Tsathogga and his worshippers. Its warty, putrid skin is a pale yellow-green, and two monstrous eyes that have seen unknown secrets gaze from its fleshy face. The body of the thing resembles that of a massive toad, but rather than legs the herald of Tsathogga drags itself through the murky terrain on ten thick tentacles. These tentacles are covered in tiny lancets that inject paralytic venom. Some who have seen the herald of Tsathogga swear that it is capable of flight, but these reports are dismissed as madman's fantasy. Though only one herald is thought to exist, rumors as of late, speak of at least three of these creatures in existence. A herald of Tsathogga attacks first with its tentacles, attempting to paralyze or otherwise incapacitate as mopponents as possible. Paralyzed opponents are pulled to the creature's maw and bitten. Its tentacles are not coordinated enough to grab moving targets, so it cannot pick up opponents that have not been paralyzed. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley.",51200
Heresy Devil,12,outsider,Hell,"Seemingly fused with a monstrous throne of iron skulls, this impossibly corpulent being floats several feet off the ground. Trappings cut in mockery of holy vestments do little to cover the thing's pallid, leaking rolls of blister-pocked girth. Worthless, clublike hands waggle like maggots, directing a cloud of weathered scrolls and blasphemous tomes that orbit its bulk. Barely distinguishable amid its mound of chins squints a pair of glassy black eyes, riding above a disproportionately wide mouth curled into a perpetually lecherous grin.","Bloated scholars of despair, ayngavhauls collect, create, and spread heresies and apocrypha, sowing disbelief and corruption to all who would seek their foul wisdom. Ironically among the most humanlike, yet still most repulsive breeds of devilkind, these corpulent blasphemers are barely even able to move without the aid of their profane floating thrones. Although their bloated forms make them considerably less of a threat than their brethren physically, they speak maledictions foul enough to agonize those who hear them, yet even with such powers of vicious wisdom, their true strength lies in their envenomed words and temptations of the mind. Their centuries of research grant them great leverage over their diabolical kin, and few devils dare not obey the summons of these hellish scholars. Ayngavhauls are roughly ovular in form, their def lated girths about 10 feet tall with their rolls of wet gristle spreading over 13 feet wide. Off their thrones, these devils weigh approximately 2,300 pounds, though the eldest can weigh considerably more. Ecology Ayngavhauls' bloated girths make them slaves to their repulsive physical forms. All ayngavhauls, even the newly formed, are monstrously obese, trapped within prisons of their own leaking, diabolical flesh. To aid them, though, the forges of Phlegethon create terrifying thrones empowered by infernal magics. These foul chariots hold their corpulent masters aloft, serving as both vehicles and sources of profane protection. Each throne of skulls is bound to a specific ayngavhaul, dissolving into a pile of ashes and a breath of searing iron dust should its master be destroyed. Habitat & Society The majority of ayngavhuals frequent the grim libraries of Hell, particularly the mired museums of Stygia; the Fallen Fastness of Dis; and Betzebbul, the palace of Baalzebul, in Cocytus. Within these heretical storehouses and academies of evil, these grotesque devils rewrite the histories of countless worlds to obscure truths and skew the past toward the desires of Hell. Grotesque curators of a sort, individual ayngavhauls take great pride in specializing in fields none of their brethren have ever thought to focus their studies upon-the more obscure and blasphemous, the better. Thus, while one devil might spend eons learning all there is to know of linnorm frost poisons, another might research the nuances of Azlanti voice tearing. Each seeks to promote its particular field of research above all others, sowing its knowledge among their blasphemous works, minions, and summoners who might put such foul wisdom to the most sinister uses. They prove incessantly paranoid that the works of their brethren might be outstripping their own discoveries, or that others in related fields might be stealing their research, thus proving both suspicious of their kindred and intimately familiar with the works of other infernal scholars. As such, a single ayngavhaul might begrudgingly point a summoner in search of specific information toward a diabolical expert, though these knowledge-obsessed fiends never reveal their secrets without demanding a price.",19200
Hezrou,11,outsider,swamps,"This fiend's armored f lesh is scaly and moist. Its large, toothy mouth gapes below a pair of hungry, reptilian eyes.","The hezrou dwells in the vast Abyssal swamps, mires, and watersways, equally at home on land and in the waters. The presence of a hezrou has an obvious effect on the nearby flora and waters, causing plant life to twist and knurl and infusing waters with a foul odor and brackish taste- signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous deformities. Often, entire backwaters communities of deformed mutants owe their twisted countenances not as much to incest and poor breeding as they do to a hezrou's proximity. Although quite intelligent, a hezrou can fairly be said to waste its intellect. They prefer the simple pleasures-slumber, the thrill of torture, the bliss of feasting on a living meal, or the joy of feeling something beautiful breaking and crumbling in a clenched fist. They do not often seek to build empires or lead cults-although few hezrous would turn away prospective minions who came to serve the demon on their own. These monstrous and bestial creatures form from the souls of evil mortals who poisoned themselves, their kin, or their surroundings, such as drug addicts, assassins, and alchemists who cared not how their experiments polluted the environment.",9600
Hieracosphinx,5,magical beast,warm hills,A cold-eyed falcon's head and great wings adorn the body of this otherwise leonine creature.,"The least intelligent of the common sphinxes, hieracosphinxes are a cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are male. They despise the larger and cleverer androsphinxes and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a twisted mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty and power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight. Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack. They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them. As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions. Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to more powerful riders, though they still inf lict their foul tempers on weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb. A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351-700 pounds; and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A typical hieracosphinx is just short of 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds. Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a rider into battle, thus increasing the DCs of combat-related Ride checks by +5.",1600

Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the same color. hills giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair their garments, preferring simply to add more hides as their old ones wear out. Adults are around 10 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. hills giants can live to be 200 years old, but almost never do. hills giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. hills giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs. hills giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer temperate climates, they'll travel far from their preferred environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don't automatically know they'll win. hills giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won't hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hills giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate. Solitary, non-evil hills giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hills giant bands.

Hippocampus,3,magical beast,temperate waters,"This strange creature appears to be half-horse and half-fish. The front half resembles a sleek stallion with a flowing mane and long, sleek legs ending in wide fins rather than hooves. The hindquarters are that of a great fish.","A hippocampus is often called a merhorse or sea horse, for it is indeed a half-horse/half-fish creature of the sea. The hindquarters of the animal are that of a great fish. Its body is covered in fine scales in the fore parts and large scales elsewhere. The hippocampus' scales vary in color from ivory to deep green, with shades of blue and silver. waters races often tame these animals, and they make fine steeds, for they are strong, swift, and very intelligent. A hippocampus is about 8 feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. Hippocampuses speak Aquan. Some speak common. Hippocampuses are docile creatures and only fight if threatened or if an ally is threatened. In combat, they use their powerful bite or tail slap. On rare occasions, the hippocampus may butt an opponent with its head. Training a Hippocampus A hippocampus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a hippocampus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly hippocampus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a hippocampus requires an exotic saddle. A hippocampus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Hippocampus eggs are worth 1,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 2,500 gp each. Professional trainers  charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus.

Hippogriff,2,magical beast,temperate hills or plains,"This large, brown, horse-like creature has a hawk's wings, talons, and hooked beak.","The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke. A hippogriff 's feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff 's torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds. Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts. Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature's wings-these saddles are always exotic saddles. Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young- as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff 's egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more.

Its eyes are frozen solid and show no signs of life.","Believed to be the spirits of humanoids that freeze to death either because of their own mistakes or because of some ritualistic exile into the icy wastes by their culture, hoar spirits haunt the icy wastelands of the world seeking warm-blooded living creatures in which to share their icy hell. Hoar spirits are rarely encountered alone. Though they act independently and never communicate, something draws these creatures to each other. Perhaps some semblances of their former lives or maybe like-minded creatures that share the same fate are drawn together. Sages have speculated this for ages. Hoar spirits do not speak, and it is not known if they even understand language at all. They have a distinctive low-pitched moan that sounds like a whistling wind blowing through ice and snow covered trees. When confronted, a hoar spirit attacks with its claws attempting to freeze its foe. If facing multiple opponents, a hoar spirit blasts them with its cone of cold before engaging them with its claws. Creatures killed by a hoar spirit are dragged to its icy lair, kept on ice, and devoured at the monster's leisure. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Hobgoblin,0.5,humanoid,temperate hills,"Standing as tall as a human, this muscular, gray-skinned creature peers about with tiny, observant eyes.","Hobgoblins are militaristic and fecund, a combination that makes them quite dangerous in some regions. They breed quickly, replacing fallen members with new soldiers and keeping up their numbers despite the fortunes of war. They generally need little reason to declare war, but more often than not that reason is to capture new slaves- life as a slave in a hobgoblin lair is brutal and short, and new slaves are always needed to replace those who fall or are eaten. Of all the goblinoid races, the hobgoblin is by far the most civilized. They see the larger and more solitary bugbears as tools to be hired and used where appropriate, usually for specif ic missions involving assassination and stealth, and look upon their smaller goblin kin with a mix of shame and frustration. Hobgoblins admire goblin tenacity, yet their miniscule kindred's unpredictable nature and fondness for fire make them unwelcome additions to hobgoblin tribes or settlements. Nonetheless, most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, typically squatting in the most undesirable corners of the settlement. Mhobgoblin tribes combine their love of warfare with keen intellects. The science of siege engines, alchemy, and complex feats of engineering fascinate most hobgoblins, and those who are particularly skilled are treated as heroes and invariably secure high-ranking positions in the tribe. Slaves with analytical minds are quite valued, and as such raids on dwarven cities are commonplace. It is well known that hobgoblins mistrust and even despise magic, particularly arcane magic. Their shamans are treated with a mix of fear and respect, and are usually forced to live alone on the fringes of the tribe's lair. It is all but unheard of to find a hobgoblin practicing arcane magic, or as hobgoblins call it, ""elf magic."" This is the root of their hatred of magic-the hobgoblins' hatred of elves.

Hodag,5,magical beast,temperate forests or marshes,"Spikes cover the body of this vaguely reptilian creature, jutting forth from nearly every angle. The beast's gaping mouth is filled with dagger-sharp teeth, and a sinister crimson glow fills its eyes. Squat and powerful, the creature's arms terminate in massive clawed feet just as suited to digging as to rending a foe limb from limb.","As stout as a bull, with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags are fierce forests predators hunting along the edges of civilization in the thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales cover the beasts, helping them to blend in amid the underbrush, and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the oppressive darkness of the thick forests. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets the region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark brown fur, sprouting in tufts from between their scales and helping them blend in with dead vegetation. Males sport large curving spikes on their heads that look like forward-facing horns. Mbelieve that hodags are not true-breeding beasts but rather a unique and specific terror that has lived and hunted certain woodlands for ages. Mregional people living near such wildernesses consider hodags a myth, nothing more than the sort of tall tale that is typical of excitable rural folk. Some go so far to use ""hodagger"" as a derogatory term for the more rustic and simple people working the forests and rivers. Folklorists say the first hodag rose from the charred remains of an ox sacrificed to cleanse foul spirits. The ritual failed on the seventh day of burning, and this foul beast climbed from the pyre and devoured those performing the rites as a putrid smell spread through the forests like a rancid fog. Superstitious lumberjacks refuse to work when similar fogs hang thick in the woods, even though mwho don't know or don't care about such tales claim such fogs are perfectly natural or mere swamps gases. The oral tradition passed down from the people living in regions hunted by hodags tells that the name comes from the combination of ""horse"" and ""dog,"" two of the beast's favorite meals. A typical male hodag measures over 10 feet from the snout to the tip of the tail and 4-1/2 feet at the shoulder, though when they rear back on two legs, they reach far more intimidating heights. Females tend to be a foot or more smaller but are stockier; both male and female hodags weigh around 700 pounds. Female hodags also lack horns . Ecology Hodags do not typically seek out creatures to hunt. Rather, the unpredictable beasts wander the forests and countryside in the hope of something crossing their paths. If a hodag becomes interested-something that seems to depend wholly on the appeal of a being's scent or appearance-it will follow and stalk a creature, unwilling to stop until it has fed upon its prey. Hodags sometimes stalk their prey for weeks, some say to fill victims with fear and panic, making them thinner. They tend to prefer lean meals that provide considerable crunching sounds as they are consumed. Some tales claim the beast doesn't feed upon the actual bodies of its victims but rather on the fear of those about to be consumed and the pleasure of the crunch. The scene of a hodag attack appears to back up this claim, as the beast dismembers and shreds its victims, throwing viscera and body parts about the area and consuming very little actual meat. This is actually due to the eating habits of the creature. While they enjoy killing at time, hodags gorge themselves only once every 3 months. During these feasts, they can eat an entire herd of horses, consuming thousands of pounds of food in one attack. Habitat and Society Extremely secluded and territorial creatures, hodags are rarely seen together. During mating season, hodags expand their usual hunting grounds and wander farther from their dens on the chance that they may find a mate. The courtship is abrupt and to the point, and after the act of breeding, the two hodags depart in opposite directions. The female hodag finds an isolated place in the forests and digs a den in which to birth her young. Despite their reptilian appearance, hodags do not lay eggs but rather give live birth to a small litter of no more than three or four young. Sibling rivalry is strong and play is often rough. Not all young hodags survive this competition, ensuring only the strongest of the litter make it to maturity. Hodags on Golarion Tales of hodags and hodag-like creatures fill the legends of several regions and backwaters across Avistan. Noted here are three locations where the myth of the hodag takes on a fearsome life. Falcon's Hollow: The thick woods surrounding Falcon's Hollow in Andoran echo with cautionary tales offered to children and apprentice lumberjacks of a particularly massive hodag missing an eye. Everyone knows someone who claims her great-great-granddad was responsible for plucking out the eye of this frightening beast or was a companion of the one responsible. There are as mstories about how it happened as there are surnames of those said to be responsible. The Chitterwood: In southern Isger, a foul hodag hunts without end. Oral tradition from the region places this dark beast there long before man settled, and storytellers claim the creature is actually a living shadow in the terrifying form of a hodag. The only safety from the beast lies in sunlight, something not always in great supply deep in the heart of the wood. The Lower Sellen: In the southern part of the rivers Kingdoms, where the Sellen rivers collects its tributaries into a mighty torrent flowing toward the lands downstream, tales of a hodag capable of flight keep travelers watching the skies as they move through the region. Stories dispute the origin of this terrible beast, with some claiming the creature resulted from a mad druid's magic and others saying its mother was a powerful manticore. The mysterious claw marks high in several of the region's trees are cited as evidence of the beast's fearsome climbing ability.",1600
Hollow Serpent,16,undead,underground,"This creature looks like an oversized, empty snakeskin, its body covered in barbs and maw filled with jagged teeth.","Crafted from the shed skins of great snakes by serpentfolk necromancers and other foul spellcasters, hollow serpents are plagued by an eternal hunger they can never sate. The act of draining energy from living creatures blunts these supernatural pangs, driving the hollow serpent to constantly seek new prey. A hollow serpent is a difficult undead to create-most of them were crafted by a long-forgotten god of the serpentfolk and not by mortal spellcasters at all. The exact methods by which a mortal might create a hollow serpent are obscure, but most scholars have come to the conclusion that the use of powerful artifacts or the aid of a demigod may be required for such a feat.

Homunculus,1,construct,any,"This vaguely humanoid creature is about the size of a cat but looks more like a toothy, winged devil.","A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a spellcaster from his own blood. They are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features; some are more refined looking, but most creators don't bother to improve the creature's appearance beyond the minimum necessary for functioning. Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile from its master, though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to return to this range, as it cannot communicate with its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the creature's master is slain, the homunculus goes insane-it loses its Intelligence score, all feats, and all skill ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings as its domain, mindlessly attacking who intrude upon its lair. On rare occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its master's original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master's legacy, or even the reincarnated spirit of the master himself. Construction A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring waters, and one pint of the creator's own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create. The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus's body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood.

Hound Archon,4,outsider,any,This canine-headed humanoid's well-groomed appearance and polished greatsword show it to be more than a common beast.,"Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine heads typically resembling those of noble-looking wolves or dogs. Well trained, they prefer to make use of their greatswords in battle, though they are equally adept with their natural weapons. Hound archons loathe killing mortals and prefer to disarm or incapacitate even evil individuals when they can. Against fiends and the irredeemably corrupt, though, they show no mercy. Hound archons are disciplined soldiers and sentinels. Occasionally good-aligned deities send them to watch over specific places and individuals they take a particular interest in. Under the guise of unassuming but friendly strays, such secret defenders might follow their ward or guard their post subtly for years. In Heaven's armies, exceptional hound archon paladins lead their fellows into combat, taking on roles as captains and knights. They lead incursions against fiendish holdings, whether that entails strikes against daemonic fortresses or liberating the captives of night hag soul collectors. Such missions make hound archons perhaps the most likely celestials one might encounter upon the Lower Planes, and packs of swift-moving wolves occasionally reveal themselves to be welcome saviors to those lost within such realms.

Howler,3,outsider,land,"This vile predator has a hide as thick and tough as leather. Wicked ebony quills run from its head, tail, and back.","The howler is a native to the Abyss, an Outer Plane where madness is the norm and cruelty is expected and often rewarded. The howler prowls these Abyssal realms, serving the role of a hungry predator like a lion or tiger, save for the fact that the typical howler is much more intelligent than a big cat. Worse, howlers have little interest in eating their prey-they need not feed to live, but rather enjoy the process of stalking, mauling, and killing living creatures. In a way, the act of inflicting intense pain and madness upon mortal life is what fills a howler's life instead of the desire to feed. The howler's mane of razor-sharp quills makes it a poor choice of mount for most creatures, but it serves quite well as a guardian or sentinel-especially for outsiders, who may not enjoy the creature's constant howling, but aren't adversely affected by the supernatural sounds. When a howler sees prey, the tenor of its howls changes- howlers cannot speak, but they can use their howls to communicate quite a bit of information if required. They understand the Abyssal tongue, and when serving demons as guardians, their howls can not only alert their masters to the presence of intruders, but also to their number, appearance, and weaknesses. A howler is about the size of a tiger-12 feet from snout to tail and weighing 6,000 pounds. They are normally pale in color, with darker quills and milky eyes.",800

As punishment for their transgression, their god condemned them to roam the earth as the one creature all good-aligned clerics despise - undead. Huecuva resemble robed skeletons and are often mistaken for such creatures. A huecuva attacks with its claws, raking and slashing at its opponents. It attacks relentlessly until either it or its opponent is dead. During combat, if a good-aligned cleric attempts to turn a huecuva and fails, the huecuva concentrates all attacks on that cleric, ignoring all other opponents until the cleric or the huecuva is dead.

Huge Acid Quasi-elemental,5,outsider,Quasi-Plane of Acid,"What was once a still puddle of green liquid rises up like a wave, lashing out with acid-dripping tendrils. In the midst of the pool, one can barely make out regions of darker green that form a vaguely human face.","Nestled among the various elemental there lies a plane composed entirely of acid. It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by mto be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elemental-based planes. Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable. They have no trouble moving on land, but prefer the sanctity of their native plane to all others. At rest, an acid quasi-elemental is a clear puddle of liquid with a slightly green hue. It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a waters elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that emits wisps of smoke. Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools when combating foes. A favored tactic is to grab a foe and pull it into the quasi-elemental's acid pool, subjecting it to massive amounts of acid damage . Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Huge Air Elemental,7,outsider,Plane of Air,"This cloud-like creature has dark hollows reminiscent of eyes and a mouth, and a howling wind whips it into ominous shapes.","Air elementals are fast, flying creatures made of living air. Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing through the endless skies. Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwaters, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwaters.

Four spiraling, rotating arms of debris and light surround the circular region of darkness. Its facial features are small points of light, almost like stars.","A gravity elemental embodies the very force that controls and holds together the fabric of the universe. The actual elemental is a tiny, superdense ball of matter deep within a zone of darkness and spiraling arms of debris that comprise the body of the elemental. A gravity elemental has mass and size, but no effective weight. Gravity elementals originate on a weird, recently discovered plane that scholars affectionately call the Plane of Gravity. The elemental's home plane is a flat, rocky place with little life, no known waters sources, and no plant life or foliage. The plane is always shrouded in darkness. Dense pockets of intense gravity and areas of little or no gravity dot the barren landscape. Gravity elementals seem to be able to converse with others of their kind by manipulating gravity itself. Gravity elementals attack primarily by flailing at their opponents with multiple arms, each one a mixture of fluctuating fields of micro-gravity and debris that has been sucked into its gravity well. These creatures can also attack by adjusting the local gravity fields around themselves. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",3200

Huge Monstrous Sea Wasp,7,vermin,warm waters,"A translucent blue and nearly invisible in waters, this cube-shaped jellyfish has four distinct sides and trails dozens of extremely long tentacles.","Monstrous sea wasps are deadly waters creatures with long, writhing and highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm waters and tend to congregate near coastlines regions or rivers mouths where they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience. A creature stung by a sea wasp that lives to tell about, never forgets its brush with this monstrosity. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.",3200

It conceals the rest of its body beneath a long dark robe.","Huggermuggers are small, underground dwelling humanoids that relish in chaos, disorder, trickery, and the fine art of thieving. These degenerate humanoid creatures have only been encountered in large cities with extensive sewer systems, but it is not known how their race has spread or how it developed. Most compare them to rats for swarming up from the filth to feed on human society like great parasites. A few fear-mongering city dwellers loudly speculate that the huggermuggers maintain vast tunnel complexes that connect all of the large cities of the world, and that some day the vile race will issue up from the depths as an invading army. Huggermuggers do not speak, other than the incessant chattering and mumbling they seem to constantly indulge in. Their language has yet to be translated by sages, so what they call themselves remains a mystery. The name ""huggermugger"" is a nonsense word akin to ""boogeyman,"" being a name used in stories to scare children into remaining close to home and not exploring the sewers and dark alleys of the city. Curiously, their skin is pale and cold to the touch, regardless of the actual temperature in the surrounding area. A band of huggermuggers slowly circles its opponents, chattering and mumbling so as to cause confusion. Each round they circle a foe, one huggermugger moves in, attacks with its hook-blade, and then falls back into the circle as another prepares to attack. If outnumbered or outclassed, huggermuggers prefer to attack from ambush, confusing their opponents before robbing or slaying them. Hook-Blade  The hook-blade is 13 inches long with a wooden handle and finely sharpened, curved blade on one end. A smaller blade protrudes from the other side of the weapon.

Huldras are aware of this tale and find it both insulting and unbelievable, yet the legend persists. There is no greater way to inf lame a huldra's anger than to speak about this myth, and huldras' hatred of all things trollish is well documented. A huldra appears to be a beautiful human woman when viewed from the front, yet two distinctive features mark the huldra as something supernatural: her long foxlike tail, and the fact that she has no back- merely a hole that reveals her body to be a hollow, bark-lined shell. Most huldras wear their hair long to mask their backs, and they prefer long gowns to hide their tails when interacting with humanoids. Though huldras are not ashamed of their status, they react extremely negatively to those who point out their tails. So long as humanoids are respectful, however, huldras tend to be curious about other races, and may aid those who pass through their territories by telling them the best places for hunting or fishing. In some cases, huldras may even become enamoured with the woodcutters and other outdoor adventurers they encounter, taking them to their beds, but these romances usually end in disappointment and misunderstanding shared by both sides.

Zombies attack until destroyed, having no regard for their own safety. Although capable of following orders, zombies are more often unleashed into an area with no command other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies are often encountered in packs, wandering around places the living frequent, looking for victims. Most zombies are created using animate dead. Such zombies are always of the standard type, unless the creator also casts haste or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to create plague zombies. Creating a Zombie ""Zombie"" is an acquired template that can be added to corporeal creature , referred to hereafter as the base creature. Challenge Rating: This depends on the creature's new total number of Hit Dice, as follows: HD CR XP 1/2 1/8 50 1 1/4 100 2 1/2 200 3-4 1 400 5-6 2 600 7-8 3 800 9-10 4 1,200 11-12 5 1,600 13-16 6 2,400 17-20 7 3,200 21-24 8 4,800 25-28 9 6,400 Alignment: Always neutral evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains subtype except for alignment subtypes  and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor Class: Natural armor is based on the zombie's size: Zombie Size N atural Armor Bonus Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium +2 Large +3 Huge +4 Gargantuan +7 Colossal +11 Hit Dice: Drop HD gained from class levels  and change racial HD to d8s. Zombies gain a number of additional HD as noted on the following table. Zombie Size Bonus Hit Dice Tiny or smaller - Small or Medium +1 HD Large +2 HD Huge +4 HD Gargantuan +6 HD Colossal +10 HD Zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points . Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. Defensive Abilities: Zombies lose their defensive abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR 5/slashing. Speed: Winged zombies can still fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the zombie. Retain all other movement types. Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon prof iciencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the zombie's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size . Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Abilities: Str +2, Dex -2. A zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis and Cha become 10. BAB: A zombie's base attack is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice. Skills: A zombie has no skill ranks. Feats: A zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and does not gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following special quality. Staggered : Zombies have poor ref lexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. Variant Zombies The typical zombie is a slow-moving abomination that is tough to destroy. Yet this tough zombie is not the only type of zombie to plague crypts or stalk graveyards. Each of the following two variant zombies modif ies the base zombie in a few simple ways. Fast Zombie Unlike the standard, plodding zombie, a fast zombie moves with a supernatural quickness. Speed: Increase the base creature's land speed by 10 feet. Defensive Abilities: A fast zombie does not gain DR 5/ slashing. Special Attacks: A fast zombie gains the following special attack. Quick Strikes : Whenever a fast zombie takes a fullattack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus. Abilities: As a standard zombie, except its Dexterity is increased by 2 instead of reduced by 2. Special Qualities: A fast zombie does not gain the staggered special quality.

Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours.",200
Humbaba,19,monstrous humanoid,forests,"This towering, horned, lion-faced giant has long, braided hair and is outfitted in various pieces of plate armor.","Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world. Although a humbaba has the body of a powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords. The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind.",204800
Hungerer,15,monstrous humanoid,cold mountains,"A hideous mound of shuddering, pustule-encrusted flesh, this bloated creature's gaping maw is filled with terrible teeth.","Once regular lamias, these hideously deformed creatures are the result of terrible fleshwarping experiments that have rarely been repeated since the fall of Thassilon. The heads and torsos of these creatures are nearly 10 feet in diameter, and a typical hungerer weighs about 20,000 pounds. Hungerers are unnatural creatures, re-released into the world with Karzoug's awakening. These terrors live in constant pain and serve as living embodiments of hunger, insatiable in their constant quests for sustenance. Although they prefer to tear and rend living flesh, hungerers can consume almost organic material, and might even gnaw on stone or metal without ill effect when nothing else is available.",51200
Hungry Fog,6,ooze,temperate,"Horrid shapes form within this cloying green mist, which pulses sporadically and with seeming voracity.","This eerie, vaporous ooze slips silently through the air, a roiling cloud of green fog within which dance the indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky ghosts. Despite its haunting appearance, and despite the fact that hungry fogs often dwell in old graveyards or hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is not an undead creature. Rather, it is a form of gaseous ooze infused with negative energy. Thus, while a hungry fog is not an undead creature, undead gain considerable boons by fighting within a hungry fog, for its mists heal them as surely as they drain vitality from the living creatures caught within. Within a hungry fog, the ooze's mists interact strangely with fragments of those it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past victims. Periodically, one of these shapes might flash with light as if momentarily holding a lantern aloft, but as soon as the figure is approached, it fades away into the surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These shapes, like the fog itself, are not truly undead, but the fact that a hungry fog is hurt by positive energy as surely as if it were helps to blur the distinction and spread even more confusion about its actual nature. A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where negative energy is strong. These nocturnal creatures are particularly fond of sites that are haunted, such as old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along shorelines-although their vulnerability to high winds means that they are rarely encountered in areas where storms are common.",2400
Hunter Urchin,1,vermin,temperate or warm oceans or coastlines,This strange-looking creature has a spherical body covered with hundreds or thousands of two-foot-long bright purple spines that darken to ominous black tips.,"Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via oceans currents or, more commonly, tides. Hunter Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues that can whip out and pull food to them. Spear Urchins: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed. Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin's venom. Sea Urchins as Difficult Terrain The giant sea urchins presented here are fantastic evolutions of their much more common, smaller, and less offensive kin. Yet even the smaller common urchins can pose a problem for unwary adventurers. Sea urchins live in vast colonies on tidal rocks, and moving across a field of urchins can be quite awkward and painful. Their thousands of spines are just as sharp as those possessed by their larger kin, and they function as caltrops to anyone that walks over them. Worse, these spines are venomous, and can poison those who take damage from them. Those who succumb to the poison suffer searing pain that can sicken them for several minutes. Though uncomfortable, fortunately this venom doesn't actually inf lict either ability damage or ability drain. Sea Urchin Venom: Spines-injury; save Fort 11; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect victim is sickened for 1 minute; cure 1 save.",400
Hutijin,22,outsider,any,This creature is at least twice as tall as a human and large bat-like wings protruding from its massive shoulders. A whip-like tail trails behind its scaled form. Its hands and feet end in wicked-looking claws and its mouth is filled with sharpened teeth and two oversized fangs. Upward-curving horns project from its head. Its flesh is dark red.,"Hutijin is a loyal servant of Mephistopheles and commands 2 companies of pit fiends in the infernal armies of the eighth plane of Hell. Hutijin is a noble Mephistopheles' court and commands much respect from the other dukes and nobles. His battle prowess and strong demeanor command respect from the other dukes of Hell. Hutijin stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. Hutijin prefers to summon devils to deal with interlopers or adversaries, rather than waste time fighting them in melee. However, if pressed into combat, he fights with his trident, all the while peppering his foes with fireballs.

Hyaenodon,4,animal,warm deserts,"Slightly larger than a normal hyena, this spotted canine has the same shorter forelimbs of that breed but with a blunt face and larger teeth.","The hyaenodon, sometimes called the short-faced hyena is a slightly larger relative of the common hyena. Hyaenodons  are generally thought of as scavengers but, in fact, most are skilled hunters quite capable of taking down large prey. When food is scarce, hyaenodons cover large areas individually in search of food, relying primarily on their sense of smell to locate potential prey. Hyaenodons are very dangerous predators. They cover wide ranges of territory when hunting and prefer to disembowel their kills. These creatures either hunt alone or in large packs led by a single leader. Though they sometimes scavenge animals, the hyaenodon's sheer strength and size allows it to kill animals with ease . Favored meals include lions, deer, elk, moose, zebras, and bison. The largest hyaenodons  do not generally hunt in packs. They are solitary creatures by nature and hunt alone. Hyaenodons have large, upward pointing ears and dark spots along their bodies. As they age, these spots grow darker. They range in size from 5 to 8 feet long and weigh anywhere from 300 to 330 pounds. The largest hyaenodons reach lengths of 14 feet and weigh up to 600 pounds. Hyaenodons have massive jaws and large bone crushing teeth. They walk on their toes, and their claws are blunt and non-retractile. A distinguishing feature of the hyaenodon is the difference in length between the front and rear limbs, which gives it the appearance of always running uphills. Hyaenodons generally circle their opponents, sending a few of their number against their prey from all sides. The larger hyaenodons simply charge and bite their prey, crushing bone and tearing flesh with their teeth. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Hydra,4,magical beast,temperate marshes,"Multiple angry snake-like heads rise from the sleek, serpentine body of this terrifying monster.","You can make more powerful hydras by increasing their Hit Dice-each added HD increases the hydra's statistics as appropriate, but also gives it one additional head and a +1 increase to its natural armor. A hydra's CR increases by +1 for each Hit Die it gains. Cryohydra/Pyrohydra : Variants of the standard hydra, the cryohydra lives in cold marshes or on glaciers, while the pyrohydra prefers deserts or volcanic mountains. A cryohydra gains the Cold subtype, while a pyrohydra gains the Fire subtype. Each of its heads has a breath weapon  useable every 1d4 rounds.

Hydrodaemon,8,outsider,any,The skin on this frog-like fiend is clammy and its eyes look dead and milky; its wide face is split by a fanged maw.,"While at first glance these creatures seem like enormous and foul boggards, their dangerous gait, dead eyes, and wicked claws give away their fiendish nature. In their home environment, hydrodaemons swim the sickening rivers and seas of Abaddon and the rivers Styx, ducking beneath the rivers of pus and bile only to leap out at enemies and rend their flesh with tooth and claw. It is said these are among the few creatures able to survive in the deadly waters of the rivers Styx. When called to the Material Plane, hydrodaemons serve powerful spellcasters, protecting domains dotted with pools, streams, and even sewer complexes. Associated with death by drowning, these fiends use a favored tactic to draw the most anguish from their victims. Hydrodaemons first attack with their inky black sleep spittle, hoping to render victims unconscious. With their opponents unable to fight back, hydrodaemons drag their enemies into the foul waters they call home and delight as the liquid fills their victims' gasping lungs. If unable to drown a victim, they finish the job with jaws and claws. Hydrodaemons possess an awkward gait, springing back on their heels and leaping about like humanoid frogs. Even so, they move in an unpredictable manner, twisting their bodies with each hopping movement. Hydrodaemons can also unfurl flaps of skin that allow them to glide through the air. Hydrodaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh upward of 3,000 pounds.",4800
Hyena,1,animal,warm plains,"This hyena is covered in shaggy, tan-colored fur with black and brown stripes.","Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving, laughter-like vocalizations.

Iathavos,20,outsider,any,"This immense creature has four bat-like wings and a spherical body. Red eyes peer from all sides, and two huge claws dangle below.","The most terrible of the qlippoth, with the exception of the qlippoth lords, is doubtless the immense iathavos. Believed by mto be a singular entity, a unique qlippoth so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at one time, the iathavos is often encountered attended by numerous nyogoth qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by its shuddersome passing. These nyogoths are invariably other creatures that the iathavos has absorbed and remade-they represent one of the most heinous fates that could await would-be explorers of the deepest Abyssal rifts. The iathavos crusades against the demonic scourge, but the monster does not limit its attentions to seeking out and destroying demons in preparation for the return of the Abyss to qlippoth rule. Indeed, the iathavos has the ability to shift among the various planes of the multiverse, and often travels to Material Plane worlds to systematically scour realms clean of mortal life, thus ensuring that these worlds can no longer provide the raw materials-sinful mortal souls-the Abyss relies upon to create new demons. Worlds visited by the iathavos are notable for the widespread devastation and the unusually large populations of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay the iathavos leaves behind. The iathavos can be called via the most powerful spells, such as gate, but its immunity to mind-affecting effects and its vast size ensure that only the most desperate or most insane ever attempt such a self-destructive act. In all known cases, the deliberate conjuration of the iathavos to another world has done little more than draw the attention of the powerful creature to that world, so that even if it is banished back to the Abyss before it can cause too much devastation, the iathavos remembers the visit. It often returns under its own power at a later date to pursue its own goals on the newly discovered world. Only if the iathavos is presented with defenders that prevent it from achieving its destructive ruin does it flee back to the Abyss via plane shift- in such cases, the qlippoth often waits for centuries or even millennia before returning to that world, for there are always easier realms to destroy. The iathavos is a powerful and horrifying monster made all the more devastating by its incredible intellect. The creature takes care to plan its major assaults on demonic enclaves or mortal cities, even though it is powerful enough that few creatures in the multiverse can give it pause. When the iathavos is slain, the multiverse typically has only a relatively short time before the Abyss births a replacement monstrosity for the defeated qlippoth. This newly born iathavos is an entirely new creature-it does not share the memories of the previous incarnation, nor does it possess advanced hit dice or class levels the previous monster may have gained, yet its appetite and hatred for demonic life and the sins that create such life remain constant and unending.",307200
Ice Devil,13,outsider,any,"A pair of frozen, multifaceted eyes coldly judge all before this towering, insectile monstrosity.","Strategists and masterminds of Hell's armies, the insectile ice devils possess some of the most cruelly ingenious minds in Asmodeus's legions. It is said that each ice devil-known as gelugons among the ranks of devilkind-bears within its chest a stolen, frozen mortal heart, which allows it to make decisions free of all emotion. Born on the icy layer of Cocytus, Hell's seventh layer, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth layer, where they plot world-damning machinations from courts of freezing steel. Although they are perhaps the most alien and monstrous in appearance of all devils, few breeds are accorded greater respect. In combat, a gelugon prefers to let its minions engage foes in melee so that it can hang back and appraise the foe's tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. The ice devil supports its minions with its spell-like abilities, always taking care to avoid impacting its minions in the area of effect of its spells-this not from sense of camaraderie, only a cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire. Gelugons stand at 12 feet tall, and weigh approximately 700 pounds.",19200

They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds. Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid. Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls. In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear. Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.",1200

It uses its mobility to cast combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye. An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids, but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular tributes and willing sacrifices-the ice yai teach that methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects.",38400

Unfettered from the ranks and duties of diabolical armies, imps delight in opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and subtly tempt mortals toward acts of ever-greater depravity. Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play the role of dutiful servants, often granting their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In truth, though, an imp works to deliver souls to Hell, assuring that its master's soul-and as mcollateral souls as possible- faces damnation upon death. Imps vary widely in appearance, ranging through a spectrum of bestial traits and grotesque body shapes, though most take the forms of red-skinned, winged humanoids with bulbous features. Such a typical imp stands a mere 2 feet tall, has a 3-foot wingspan, and weighs 10 pounds. One in every thousand imps possesses the ability to communicate telepathically with creatures within 50 feet and the power to change its form into that of Small or Tiny animal, as per the spell beast shape II. These imp consulars are highly prized by powerful devils, who send them to serve their favored minions or to corrupt mortals with great destinies. An imp consular can be summoned via the Improved Familiar feat, but only by a spellcaster of 8th level or higher. Diabolists tell of other breeds of imps with similarly specialized abilities, but if such creatures truly exist they are an especially rare lot. Unlike most devils, imps often find themselves free and alone on the Material Plane, particularly after they've been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters have perished . With no way to return home, these imps, freed of their bonds to arcane masters, can become dangerous pests or even leaders of small tribes of savage humanoids like goblins or kobolds.",600
Impundulu,11,outsider,temperate or warm forests,"A dark shadow moves rapidly across the ground. In the skies high above, silhouetted by the sun, a monstrous, black-feathered avian creature circles. Slowly, a supernatural wind begins to swirl about the creature, and crackling sparks erupt from its body. Screeching wildly, it descends as if falling from the skies, its blood-f lecked wings tipped with cruel curved hooks, and its protruding lower beak scalloped with vicious, jagged barbs.","The tribesfolk of southern Garund tell tales of a ruthless winged shapeshifter, a bloodthirsty demon and hunter of men. They call this being impundulu, a name that loosely translates to ""lightning-bird"" after its savage avian form. Legend describes this creature as a huge, stork-like bird that rides upon fierce storms and whose dark feathers crackle with lightning. It is believed that an evil shaman summoned the first impundulu and that using an ancient, taboo ritual, the two formed a blood pact. The shaman offered the impundulu the ability to wear his mortal flesh in exchange for mastery over the demon's significant occult powers. As soon as the impundulu seized control of the shaman's body, it broke the pact- however, the ancient ritual bound the fiend to the mortal form, and even after the shaman perished, it could not shed its flesh. Thus despite its own immortality, the impundulu became forever tied to the realm of mortals. For this reason, it is said, the creature continues to forge pacts with mortal spellcasters in the hope that one day it will unbind the secrets of its cursed existence. Ecology Driven by dark and murderous desires, the impundulu stalks the fringes of the Mwangi's civilized areas, seeking out small villages and well-traveled rivers where prey is plentiful. Most of the time, the fiend hunts in its avian form. A hideous thing of similar appearance to a tremendous stork or vulture, it's readily identified by its distinctive long, jagged beak and its slender wings that each bear a hidden, hooked claw. Despite the creature's intelligence, it behaves barbarically and delights in gory slaughter. It precedes physical attacks by conjuring fierce, wrathful blasts of lightning to confuse and injure prey, then swoops in to rend its prey to pieces. In its humanoid form, the impundulu manifests as a strikingly handsome man with glistening, coal-black skin, whose eyes burn a pale, otherworldly green. His legs end in monstrous raptor's talons, and his black fingernails hang long and curved. Using this form, an impundulu can wander through villages, stalking and seducing women with lies and magic, and preying upon them by draining their blood. The creature rarely uses its humanoid form, reserving it for times it wishes to engage in subtle cruelties. Habitat & Society Impundulus remain unknown outside of Garund, and have adapted to life within its pristine and primal jungles. Usually solitary in regard to their own kind, impundulus are rarely encountered apart from the inf luences of evil spellcasters. The association between witch doctors and impundulus is well known throughout the southern continent. The two often form nefarious pacts that bind the beasts for several generations, and the demons frequently outlive their mortal cohorts, collecting their corrupted souls upon their deaths. Those foolish enough to summon an impundulu soon discover the extent of the creatures' guile and violence. Furthermore, mof these wily demons loathe mortals, and turn on their summoners the moment they complete their pacts. Real-World Mythos The impundulu's real-world origins trace back to Xhosa and Zulu tribes of Southern Africa. Tribal folklore describes the beast as a great bird whose wings crackle with lightning. Tales depict it as a shape-shifting vampire able to take the form of a beautiful man in order to seduce its victims. Most consider the impundulu to be an otherworldly demon, though others believe it to be a supernatural creature which hatches from eggs buried in lightning-struck soil. It is oft depicted as the summoned familiar of a powerful witch-man who commands it to plague victims with illness or commit violent, evil acts.",12800
Incubus,6,outsider,any,"This darkly handsome humanoid's batlike wings, curving horns, and bestial legs betray his demonic origin.","An incubus in his true form is always muscular and attractive, with long hair and intense eyes. His skin can be of color, but is always smooth and silky. When not using his wings for flight, an incubus can fold them to drape across its shoulders like a cloak-mdecorate both the inside and outside of their wings with tattoos, ink, or self-inflicted scars. Incubi stand between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh 200 pounds. When not in battle, incubi serve as counselors, torturers, and companions for greater demons. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for they delight in causing pain to their companions. Like succubi, incubi form from the chaotic evil souls of particularly lustful and rapacious mortals. Yet whereas succubi are subtle and methodical about using their charms to cause ruin, the typical incubus is forthright and forceful about his insatiable desires.",2400
Incutilis,2,aberration,oceans,"This strange nautilus drags itself forward on oversized tentacles, its crimson-streaked flesh textured like the surface of some exposed, alien brain.","Scholars know life began in the sea, and some- either paranoid or visionary-claim that the sea has manipulated the course of humanoid life through ages beyond reckoning, citing the incutilis as evidence of this. A strange sort of sea creature that appears to be little more than an oversized cephalopod, an incutilis hides a significant intelligence behind its unassuming appearance. Though most incutilises live their entire lives amid the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between waters and land, revealing terrible control over land-dwelling flesh and an alien disregard for sentient life. Limited in their ability to cross this border and travel on land by their waters physiologies, these aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore. To what ends these beings seek to explore the surface remains a mystery-perhaps they do so out of hunger, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps because they were sent. A typical incutilis weighs approximately 25 pounds, 30 with its shell, and measures 4 feet from the tips of its longest tentacles to the top of its shell. Ecology Although incutilises can live as bottom feeders, their favorite foods seem to be higher life forms-sharks, whales, and sentient oceans dwellers-and they appear to make little distinction between the living and the dead. They also make no obvious distinctions between sentient and nonsentient victims, a trait that comes across as either an extreme form of racial arrogance or total ruthlessness. At the same time, incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators and large groups of other sentient beings, and preferring instead to operate from the shadows. Incutilises' most remarkable physical process is their ability to invasively take over dead flesh. So long as a body is relatively intact, the aberration can extend the smaller, more delicate tendrils it typically keeps retracted into its shell. These tendrils are covered with myriad tiny barbs and smaller fibrous filaments it can wind into even the finest internal apertures of a living body with shocking speed and ease. Once the tendrils are in place, the strange chemical laboratory that makes up a incutilis's internal organs allows it to secrete strange chemicals and toxins directly into the body's muscles, causing deliberate contractions, releases, and convulsions that give freshly dead bodies the semblance of life, while those longer dead appear undead. This process requires the incutilis to be latched onto its victim, directing its every motion. If it retracts its tendrils, its host body collapses back into a pile of dead flesh. Despite the remarkable nature of incutilises' corpse animation process, it is far from subtle. An incutilis cannot easily hide its prominent tendrils and gleaming shell, meaning that corpse looks far from normal in well-lit conditions. In the dark or at a distance, however, the illusion can prove somewhat convincing, though still unnerving as the body twitches and jerks with the spasms caused by its waters master. Typically, witnesses who see a corpse animated by an incutilis believe it to be some sort of waterslogged undead, a misidentification that has led to the demise of more than one well-intentioned cleric. Incutilises can survive both on land and at sea, though they are at an obvious disadvantage out of waters, as their bodies are specialized for swimming, not dragging themselves along dry terrain. This limit to their mobility seems to be the primary reason they seek out corpses to take control over or unsuspecting humanoids or animals to overwhelm, claiming their bodies as convenient conveyances. Despite this, their actions rarely seem deliberately malicious, but rather result from a decision made out of dispassionate necessity. Whether they realize that their method of taking over the bodies of other living creatures is an affront to such beings or even have concept of what death means proves entirely unclear. Habitat & Society Those few aware of incutilises rarely know the creatures by name. Rather, tales of their terrors-of shambling, flesh-garbed cephalopods and whole villages overwhelmed by invaders from the deep-spread through ports and among crews of sailors, the stuff of tall tales and the lies of drunks. But regularly enough, coastlines fishing communities or the fortresses of petty pirate kings turn up desertsed, their occupants vanished except, occasionally, for a few strange, oversized nautilus shells. Incutilises can turn up in nearly body of saltwaters, but seem to favor warmer climes. More than even seeking warmer waters, however, these waters aberrations most frequently appear near deep undersea trenches. This is possibly because of some preference for the pressure of the depths or the darkness, but some also propose that incutilises are natives of the Darklands and inhabit the lightless seas of that realm in numbers unprecedented in the seas of the surface. This somewhat unpredictable range of habits has resulted in rumors of incutilises appearing in the most unusual places, like freshwaters ponds, inland fishing holes, even wells. Incutilises prove highly logical in their decision-making, seeming to know nothing of or care nothing for emotion or sympathy. This causes mwho first encounter them to believe they're nothing more than ravenous creatures, flesh stealers driven to hunt beyond their native environments. In truth, groups of incutilises act with great eff iciency and deliberateness. Such bands also gauge the potential of a possible new food source before acting to claim it, avoiding acts that would eliminate their entire food source too quickly. They might kill off a few coastlines communities, but avoid wiping out entire coastlines populations in a region. In other cases, a group of corpse-riding incutilises might capture a signif icant portion of a community's population, trapping their victims in sea caves where the incutilises can come an go as they please, where others of their race can come and collect bodies to use on land, or where their prey are sequestered like herd animals.",600
Inkanyamba,13,magical beast,tropical rivers or lakes,"This monstrous serpent rises to a great height, unfurling an opalescent hood the size of a tower shield. Swaying from side to side, the creature drops open its elongated jaw to reveal an assortment of different-sized fangs. As it hisses, lightning slashes the storm-gray skies behind it.","Sometimes called elder serpents, inkanyambas are enormous, malevolent snake-like creatures that dwell in tropical lakes and deep junglesrivers. Measuring over 60 feet long and weighing nearly 3,000 pounds, an inkanyamba resembles a dense snake with a vaguely crocodilian head, filled with multiple sets of fangs of varying lengths. Its long body is covered in multicolored scales that range from emerald green to golden and even vermilion. Males have larger hoods than females, who also have small, pointed frills running the length of their bodies. Inkanyambas live for centuries; their maximum possible lifespan is unknown. Ecology Larger than the biggest constrictors and possessing more venom than a hundred asps, the inkanyamba combines the deadliest and most efficient predatory traits of serpentkind with a diabolical intelligence. Able to attack from the waters or the land, an inkanyamba is always the top predator in its region, capable of devouring prey as large and formidable as rhinos, dire crocodiles, and even elephants. Sages once thought that the inkanyamba's elongated head was evidence of the creature being crossed with some other species, suggesting magic in the inkanyamba's origin. In reality, the inkanyamba's long skull is necessary to house the numerous glands storing the creature's venom. Once thought to be a shifting, mutating poison, the inkanyamba actually carries several different toxins in its body, each type linked to a different set of fangs within the creature's mouth. Making this ability even more potent, all inkanyambas have a latticework of small sensory organs inside their mouths and throughout their bodies in the small spaces between scales. When an inkanyamba makes physical contact with a living creature, these sensory organs detail the target's physiology in a manner that allows the inkanyamba to know which of its mtypes of venom would be deadliest. Additionally, special ducts on the inside of the inkanyamba's frontmost fangs allow the creature to spray gouts of venom up to great distances. Although an inkanyamba can only spit a single life-sapping venom, this spray needs only to make contact with a target to take effect and can blind victims caught in its blast. Even without their fabled variety of poisons, inkanyambas are capable predators. When an inkanyamba unfurls its massive hood and sways back and forth, a scintillating pattern of multi-hued scales on the inside of the creature's neck can cause a hypnotic state in those that observe it. Inkanyambas often use this ability to approach targets on land or when confronted with multiple enemies. Once a target has been bitten, an inkanyamba can throw the rest of its body forward like a coiled rope, biting and then wrapping the victim in the creature's crushing body. Inkanyambas dwell near large lakes and deep rivers. Such locations not only allow them to attack from the cover of waters, but inkanyambas also lair in underwaters caves where pockets of air have become trapped. Such nests are inaccessible to most intruders and allow the great serpents to slumber safely after gorging themselves. Habitat & Society Inkanyambas are solitary creatures except for the brief couplings that occur during mating. They favor areas that are populated by both animal life and human settlements. Pathfinders chronicling the history of the Mwangi Expanse have recounted instances of human and lizardfolk tribes alike revering inkanyambas as gods. In such cases, the monsters use their ability to control the weather and call up storms to create false portents that instill awe in the local inhabitants, extorting offerings and even living sacrifices from their terrified ""subjects."" Cruel, malicious, and accustomed to being worshiped, inkanyambas are likely to attack anything they perceive as a threat. When facing well-prepared or powerful opponents, inkanyambas retreat deep beneath the closest body of waters to exert their control over weather, using high winds to ground airborne opponents and thunderstorms to bolster their ability to summon lightning. If threatened, inkanyambas prefer escape to surrender, but some have been known to parlay with powerful groups of adventurers, usually to help the serpent acquire an item that it cannot gain for itself. Such offers, however, are never genuine, as all inkanyambas seek only their own selfish ends. In the depths of the Mwangi Expanse, the Zenj have a saying: ""Speaking to an inkanyamba only gives it time to encircle you.""",25600
Intellect Devourer,8,aberration,underground,"Devoid of a head, or features at all save for four short, clawed legs, this creature's body looks like a large, glistening brain.","Thought by some to be invaders from another dimension or planet, the sinister intellect devourers are certainly one of the world's cruelest races. Incapable of experiencing emotions or wallowing in the sins of physical pleasure on their own, intellect devourers are forced to steal bodies in order to indulge their gluttony, lust, and cruelty. Stories tell of entire cities of these creatures deep underground, where host bodies are worn like clothes to hideous orgies and vile feasts. Lone intellect devourers often dwell in ruins or caves on the edge of a civilized region so they can make periodic forays into town to ""shop"" for an attractive new body. An intellect devourer is 3 feet long and weighs about 60 pounds.",4800
Interlocutor,12,outsider,any,"At the core of this multi-limbed monstrosity of claws and blades struggles a glistening mass of veins, organs, and twisted flesh.","Interlocutors are the self-proclaimed surgeon-sculptors among kytons, viewing their practice as more art than medical process. Each victim is a new chance to study the art of pain and sensation through horror-stricken eyes. Their ability to heal the damage they inflict, even to the extent of restoring life to a subject that has only just expired, is perhaps more feared than their eagerness to cut flesh. To an interlocutor's victim, death is a mercy that is rarely offered. Nowhere is the interlocutor's mastery of flesh more apparent than in their bodies, for their apotheosis from mortal into kyton involves the shedding of useless parts down to a tangle of nerves, veins, and various organs. These are then incorporated into bodies made of semi-living metal fashioned from raw shadowstuff harvested in strange reaches of the Plane of Shadow, giving the kyton a terrifying body. Periodically, an arm or other ""leftover"" limb is retained by the kyton, but only in the same way someone might retain ownership of a treasured piece of jewelry as a keepsake or memento. Some interlocutors retain nothing of their old bodies of flesh save the brain, nerves, and portions of their circulatory system. Interlocutors are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.",19200
Inverted Giant,11,humanoid,any,No text supplied,"Perhaps one of the most disturbing of the runelords' creations was the inverted giant, a hideous monstrosity created when a runelord was displeased with a particular giant minion. Through despicable arcana long lost to the ages, giants were ritually bound and transformed so that they would continue to live and think, but only as monstrous caricatures of themselves, their bodies turned inside out in the most painful and gruesome of punishments. Needless to say, few inverted giants tried their masters' patience again, and the unimaginable pain they suffered throughout the rest of their days served as a maddening punishment that would remind them of their insolence until their merciful deaths. Before the Starstone fell and obliterated Thassilon, mof the runelords and their servants enchanted their inverted giant minions, freezing the tormented creatures in stasis so that centuries later they would continue to protect their masters' holdings, their mutilated organs providing sensory information among cunningly-looped entrails and viscera preserved by rune magic. Those who find themselves exploring Thassilonian dungeons and ruins sometimes stumble upon such horrors, inadvertently releasing the monsters and restoring them to raging life and madness, the pain of their mutilated bodies having long since driven them to insanity and burning hatred. No two inverted giants look the same, though some features remain fairly consistent between them. Instead of a head, most possess little more than a gaping maw the size of their neck, jagged bones and bits of skull serving as teeth for a monstrous mouth. They have no true eyes-what oracular systems they once had are now embedded somewhere near their sternums-but instead possess an innate sense of direction, and through the dark arcana that surges through their beings they can sense the location of their prey perfectly. Their moist, splotched bodies are marked with runes, and their muscles and bones are often visible through their translucent flesh. Inverted giants understand speech, but their deformed mouths rarely work well enough for them to be understood by others. The average inverted giant is over 20 feet tall and weighs 1,400 pounds.",12800
Invisible Stalker,7,outsider,any,"No true form can be detected, yet a sense of force and hulking malevolence is undeniable in this creature's presence.","Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as their very nature makes details of their true form difficult to discern. Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark. Minvisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into service with the instructions ""protect me from danger"" might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air. Due to their constant summoning, minvisible stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane.",3200
Irlgaunt,13,aberration,mountains or underground,"An unwholesome abomination scuttles fluidly forth, its shape combining features of both spider and squid under an armor of rugged rock. While stone protuberances gird its upper portions, below it is a thing of angry red flesh and soft pink tendrils. Two gaping orifices full of tiny barbs split its lower body-a mouthlike slit surrounded by numerous narrow red eyes and, above that, an oozing alien aperture.","Irlgaunts are large, spider-like aberrations that lurk in mountains regions and vertical subterranean chasms. While large and imposing, these arachnid-like beings are deceivingly agile, their reflexes fast and movements swift, similar to the darting motions of a hunting insect. Irlgaunts are as quick-witted as they are nimble and have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics. In Iobaria, the beasts are recognized for their eerily patient predations, hiding amid jagged rocks to attack prey and ejecting crippling blasts of rock and digestive acids upon their victims. Irlgaunts typically attack travelers scaling mountains paths with steep cliff sides, using the hazardous terrain to knock unstable hikers to their death, then skittering down the sheer cliff faces to lap up the fleshy pulp below. Most irlgaunts stand between 11 and 13 feet tall and weigh around 3,000 pounds. Ecology Irlgaunts are powerful carnivores that eat most things but seem to have a strong preference for the taste of humanoids and mountains rams, taking special enjoyment in the consumption of bone, horn, and marrow. An irlgaunt's gizzard, located near its upper orifice, is powerful enough to grind rock, creating shards of stone which the creature fires from its mouth. The resulting stone shards are combined into gastroliths- sizable, dense spheres of sharp stones veined with jellified digestive acids. These gastroliths not only help the creature grind apart the hard substances it digests, but also can be shot forth as weapons, felling and pre-digesting sizable or even flying prey. Gastroliths are under constant pressure within an irlgaunt's body and, once shot forth, prove quite fragile. Upon impacting a victim or other surface, they shatter in a rain of rock shards and hissing acid. Irlgaunts are found on and around mountains, especially near narrow trails used by travelers, mountains dwellers, or herds of sure-footed animals. The rocky environment they inhabit matches the colors of their bodies, and their uncanny ability to blend into the terrain and attack from unexpected angles makes them skilled ambush hunters. The tough limbs of an irlgaunt end in nimble, muscular tendrils. Along with being able to seek out and cling to nearly imperceptible flaws in stone, these tendrils also secrete a potent, stone-digesting acid much like that found within the beasts' gizzards. This acid allows irlgaunts not only to burn holes into solid stone, but to shape stone into whatever form they desire. Irlgaunts live for up to 300 years and reproduce asexually every half-century. They take special care to protect their offspring for this reason and watch over them for about a year, at which point the adolescent reaches maturity. Habitat & Society Irlgaunts are not particularly social creatures, but they work together when doing so is mutually beneficial. In smaller numbers, irlgaunts are more likely to live in more remote areas, while larger groups may occupy more commonly traveled mountains passes. Irlgaunts sometimes share their habitat with giants native to the region, but do so through an unspoken truce that holds little weight. A single giant walking through an area of several irlgaunts, then, is no safer than a solitary irlgaunt prowling a region populated with giants. Yet neither group goes out of its way to provoke a dangerous feud with its powerful, mountains dwelling neighbors- as long as the other group is generally content to stay out of the way. Treasure means little to irlgaunts, though if they possess a relic or magic item, they use it as bait for sentient wanderers in the region. For this reason, particularly wealthy and well-guarded travelers or merchants may be able to parley with the aberrations, exchanging riches for safe passage. Irlgaunts are largely indifferent to religion. However, some spiritually inclined irlgaunts choose to follow Rovagug, and some even become priests in his name. In such cases, a group or family of irlgaunts tend to worship the same god. Those rare irlgaunts that do worship Rovagug often take an almost personal interest in freeing the imprisoned god, delving deep into the earth and creating new abysses covered in profane images and symbols of the monstrous deity. The hope seems to be that should enough cracks be cut into the depths, Rovagug's prison deep beneath the surface might weaken enough for the god of destruction to break free. The futility of such efforts seems to matter little to the aberrations, which appear to care more about the symbolism of their destructive actions.",25600

It can be sculpted into shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, though they rarely use these, relying instead on their slam attacks. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make vocal noise, nor does it have distinguishable odor. Although the practice has fallen out of favor in modern times, the ancients of certain powerful civilizations once took great pride in crafting iron golems of tremendous size and strength.

It begins to clomp forward on iron legs, its lid slowly swinging open as if hungry for a new soul to torture.","An iron maiden golem is a variation of the iron golem. Like the torture device that is its namesake, an iron maiden golem is a hollow structure with several dagger-like blades on the inside of the lid. The golem itself has the appearance of a tall, well-muscled male or female warrior. When a living creature is placed into the iron maiden and the lid is closed the blades impale the unfortunate victim, causing an agonizing death. Unlike the coffin-like torture device, however, an iron maiden golem has articulated arms and legs, and is capable of moving under its own power. Although standard iron golems have a breath weapon, an iron maiden does not; it has the ability to usurp the essence of humanoid being enclosed within, however. The corpse of the unfortunate victim trapped in the iron maiden golem is transformed into an undead being similar to a zombie. The iron maiden, with a victim trapped inside, can then utilize some of that victim's skills, feats, or combat capabilities. A trapped victim decays at an accelerated rate, so at least once a month an iron maiden golem must be given a fresh victim or it reverts to its normal capabilities .

Ja Noi,5,outsider,temperate or warm hills,"This hunchbacked, fiery-skinned humanoid possesses black eyes beneath the bony ridges of its brow, wears elaborate heavy armor, and wields an ornate metal club.","A ja noi is an oni spirit that takes the form of a hobgoblin, and differs physically from the hobgoblins in a variety of ways, most notably its unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi's skin blazes a fiery red rather than a drab gray, and the oni bears prominent ridges on its brow and forehead. Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most oni, ja noi nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue the trials of battle and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi's skin provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within typical hobgoblins, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in their conquests. Towering over the hobgoblins it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds. Ecology All oni believe the Material Plane's inhabitants fail to take advantage of the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenes- manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for them-ja noi take a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering who would stand against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter, and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a war-ravaged battlef ield. These hardened oni often recognize the inevitable outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else while on the battlef ield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn club, the spray of dying foes' blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers. Like other oni, ja noi possess the ability to change shape, and often use this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe's head before the victim knows what's happened. This brutish trickery is usually the extent of a ja noi's guile, however, as the hobgoblin oni are hardly known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to take the brunt of an opposing army's blow while they target the commanders, always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one's life. The most powerful ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other oni to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both humanoid and goblinoid. Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on the Material Plane, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this regard. They either die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is constantly playing. Thus, most of these oni practice their battle skills constantly against one another, their strongest hobgoblin followers, and their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order to inf lict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out magical items to bolster their strength. Habitat & Society Whereas moni prefer to act alone and in secret, ja noi recognize the concept of strength in numbers, and understand that banding together is often a surer way to glorious victories than lone pursuits. The rare lone ja noi may seek out renowned heroes and martial senseis to challenge in one-on-one combat, but most of these creatures know the best way to demonstrate their prowess is in the midst of the chaotic battlefield in front of other oni, especially fellow ja noi. Often, when ja noi work together to bring carnage to the field of war, they keep track of each other's kills, ranking one another in terms of strength and skill. An individual who shows cowardice repeatedly or does not prove a useful ally swiftly meets the blade of a supposed comrade, as ja noi have little patience for weak accomplices. Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other oni, but they possess immense amounts of authority among the lesser hobgoblins around them, and so they surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi's amateur hobgoblin warriors combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly benefits the oni and they have the mortals' unquestioning loyalty. More often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle. In rare cases, more powerful oni ask ja noi to lead armies against particularly stubborn groups of opponents. Ja noi rarely refuse such requests, knowing that much blood will be shed in the ventures-and that denying the requests of stronger oni is a sure path to a quick death. Like all oni, ja noi despise and seek out kami, reveling in the destruction of minor spirits and hunting the more powerful individuals for the sheer challenge of it. Because of the strictures of the Laws of Golden Perfection, ja noi cannot directly slay kami, and so they work to direct their vicious hobgoblin armies to complete the task instead. In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no humanoid enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as bulettes and owlbears can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it doesn't take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering entire hobgoblin tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny hobgoblins in service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the oni to battle, that the resulting conf lict might temporarily sate the ja noi's incessant desire for war.",1600
Jabberwock,23,dragon,forests,"This dragon has a long neck and terrible claws. The beast shrieks and babbles, thrashing its tail and wings in a violent manner.","The jabberwock is a true creature of legend-a subject of poetry, song, and myth in mcultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature's fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them- vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. the Tane are presented in this book-the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world. When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forests lair at least a day's flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out-to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it. Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock-or of of the Tane, in fact-is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed-sometimes varying the exact particulars , but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result. The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on mworlds. VARIANT JABBERWOCKS The notion of a ""lesser"" jabberwock is something of a misnomer, for even these creatures are powerful foes. A lesser jabberwock is generally a CR 20 version of the typical jabberwock-you can achieve a creature of this power by lowering the typical jabberwock's Hit Dice by 3 and by reducing its ability scores by 4 points each. Alternatively, you can apply the young creature simple template, but bear in mind that such a monster isn't technically younger than a typical jabberwock. As creatures from the primal world of the fey, some jabberwocks are as varied as the strange terrains and The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility-a group known collectively as the ""Tane."" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of realms in that primal world, as if these environs have more to do with their manifestation than most scholars suspect. Generally, these changes simply alter the type of damage a jabberwock's eye beams deal and the types of energy it is immune to. A jabberwock from a primeval glacial world would possess eye beams that deal cold damage, while a jabberwock from a storm-lashed world would deal electricity damage with its eye beams. If the nature of a jabberwock's eye beams change, its burn ability changes to match, and it replaces its immunity to fire with immunity to the new energy type .",615000

It wears belts of skulls and rotting heads about its throat and waist.","The jacks-in irons enjoy fastening gate chains and portcullis chains around their wrists, fore-arms and shins and tie chains about their throats, shoulders and waists which hang with the heads of their mvictims. Jacks-in-irons frequently operate as highwaymen, making their dwellings in ruined towers along abandoned roads. From this base they roam out along old country trails ambushing unwary travelers, trade caravans and the knights assigned to protect them. They are known to take prisoners and hold them for high ransom. Orcs and goblins often follow a jack-in-irons as their king or leader due to its massive size, brute strength, and penchant for wickedness-all of which are things that such evil creatures admire. A jack-in-irons stands 20 to 25 feet tall and weighs 13,000 to 15,000 pounds. It prefers to dress in dark colors such as black or brown and always wears a multitude of chains about its body .

Jack-o-lantern,3,plant,land,"This creature is a roughly humanoid shaped tangle of vines and leaves with a large pumpkin for its head. The pumpkin-head bears a leering face that appears to have been carved there, and glows from within with an eldritch fire.","A jack-o-lantern is an animated plant creature brought to life by a combination of druidic magic and fey sprits. The nature of the face generally reflects the alignment of the animating spirit. A jack-o-lantern attacks with its mtendrils, rending and tearing at its prey. Occasionally one will be armed with a pitchfork or scythe. Creating a Jack-O-Lantern To create a jack-o-lantern, the caster must be a druid of at least 11th level. Creating a jack-o-lantern involves placing a single pumpkin seed into the mouth of a corpse and burying it in an open field. The body must be that of a humanoid of at least 6th level; the jack-o-lantern has the same HD and alignment as the humanoid did in life. Once the body is buried, the creator must cast control plants, awaken, summon nature's ally IV, and fire seeds-in that order. The pumpkin plant that grows from it must be carefully nurtured and tended, requiring a DC 15 Profession  check. The farming check does not need to be made by the creator. Several pumpkins will grow on the vine, one of which will contain the essence of the nature spirit that will eventually animate the plant. The creator must make a DC 20 Knowledge  check to determine which pumpkin holds the essence-all others must be picked off the vine and discarded. By harvest time, if the creator chose the right pumpkin, the jack-o-lantern will animate and seek out is creator for instructions. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",800

Jade Colossus,16,construct,any,This massive automaton stands five times as tall as a normal human and resembles a gigantic humanoid carved of smooth green stone.,"The jade colossus was first seen dominating the skiesline over the City of Brass, its massive form reflecting the light from the ever-burning fires of the City. Since that time, rumors of these creatures moving across the Material Plane have been heard in taverns and inns. Jade colossi are massive constructs built by powerful spellcasters to do their bidding; typically for protection or to wage war against an archrival. A jade colossus pummels a foe with its hardened fists; dealing massive amounts of damage with every successful strike. It almost always opens combat with its breath weapon. A typical jade colossus stands 35 feet tall and weighs about 60,000 pounds.  Ruby Star of Law Sages speak of a jade colossus located in the City of Brass that has the ruby star of law  embedded in its forehead. The Jade Guardian  is a CR 18 advanced jade colossus with the following additional ability. Energy Ray : Once per round as a swift action, the Jade Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet . Genies hit by this ray must make a successful Fortitude save  or take 6d4 points of Constitution damage. On a successful save, the genie takes onehalf damage.

Jaguar,3,animal,warm forests,The powerful feline's muscles ripple beneath a golden coat covered in dark spots with a smaller markings within those spots.,"The jaguar is a highly aggressive and ferocious great cat that makes its home in dense forests or swampsy areas near a source of freshwaters. Of all the big cats, the jaguar is the most at home in the waters. They are excellent swimmers and stalk their prey through deep waters where other cats won't go. They also excel at climbing and often spend time hunting tree-dwelling animals . The jaguar is highly territorial with its personal hunting ground often covering an area of several square miles. The typical jaguar subsists on a diet of animals such as deer, tapir, elk, fish, armadillos, and other small animals. If hungry or its food supply is thin, jaguars have been known to attack prey much larger than itself.  The jaguar has no rival among the other big cats. Jaguars are solitary creatures, but occasionally a lair is discovered that contains a female and 1d4 cubs. Cubs are often captured and sold on the market where they can be trained and raised. Jaguars are sometimes confused with leopards. Both cats have a brownish-yellow base fur with dark spots or markings. The jaguar can be distinguished by the smaller markings inside the spots. A jaguar's forelimbs and head are slightly larger than the average leopard . Black jaguars are often called black panthers . Jaguars stalk their prey and prefer to attack from ambush, swooping in and felling prey with one swift stroke of their powerful jaws. Jaguars often lock their jaws on its prey, hanging on until their prey is dead. The kill is then dragged to a safe locale and devoured or carried back to the lair where the food is divided among the cubs. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Janni,4,outsider,warm deserts,"This regal figure looks like a tall, well-proportioned human, save that its eyes sparkle with strange light.","The jann  are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most ""human"" of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds. Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements. Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep deserts and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, waters, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date. Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies. A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-augury, detect magic, and divination.

When conditions are right, jellyfish shift from being a nuisance to being a menace, if accidentally so, for a jellyfish swarm, unlike more aggressive monstrous kin like the giant jellyfish, comprises not aggressive hunters but rather opportunistic strikers. They do not generally move to attack nearby prey, but their nearly translucent coloration makes it horrifically easy for a creature to swim into a swarm unawares.

Jiang-shi,6,undead,any,"Its flesh pallid and a parchment burial prayer hanging from its brow, this risen corpse lurches forward in a series of short hops.","Jiang-shis  are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi's appearance is based on the state of the creature's corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands. A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the body's decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque form and seeks living creatures to feed upon. CREATING A JIANG-SHI ""Jiang-shi"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice . Most jiang-shis were once humans, but creature that undergoes specific rites can acquire the template. A jiang-shi uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead . Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet. It also gains the ability to sense the breathing of living creatures-a jiang-shi has blindsight to a range of 60 feet against creatures that breathe. A creature may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, jiang-shis use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A jiang-shi gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and slashing, and resistance to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast healing 5. In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following defensive ability. Prayer Scroll : The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to effects generated from spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi‘s prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver , which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed , the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll by using strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Weaknesses: Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round. Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn. Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiang-shi vampire crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy waters. Jiang-shi vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire's damage reduction. Additionally, successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature. Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the day without harm. Speed: A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds  are not affected by this reduction. Melee: A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's claws are even more dangerous than this, though-see the ""brutal claws"" special attack below. A jiang-shi's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A jiang-shi gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi's Hit Dice + the jiang-shi's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Brutal Claws : A jiang-shi's nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks. Drain Chi : Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains ""chi,"" or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check , the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As an undead creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score. Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus , and Spring Attack as bonus feats. Skills: Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Perception, and Stealth checks.",2400
Jigsaw Shark,1,animal,oceans,Jagged markings decorate the body of this human-sized shark. A multitude of stains on its large teeth tell of the frequency and ferocity with which it uses its bite.,The fact that these sharks dwell in shallow coastlines waters places them in direct contact with those making a living from the sea. It's not uncommon to hear stories of jigsaw sharks leaping from the waters and taking out dockworkers or fishermen in small boats.

Jinkin,1,fey,underground or urban,"Grimacing like a maniac, this lean little bat-eared horror displays a mouth full of needle-like teeth and glowing, orange eyes.","Sneaky and sadistic, jinkins are hideous gremlins that inhabit the dark places underground. Well acclimated to the shadows, they hide in cramped quarters and attack larger creatures when they're strategically positioned. Jinkins commonly work with or near larger or more powerful creatures; these larger creatures provide cover for the jinkins' trickery. They use dimension door to exit battle that goes badly, taking stolen goods with them. Jinkins delight in leading larger creatures into dangerous caves or pits, usually by lunging out of the shadows to make a single sneak attack against a creature and then running away, taking care while ""fleeing"" to remain visible to their target so that they can lure the victim into a trap. Jinkins also hold dangerous grudges, and one might follow a creature that supposedly slighted it for weeks, looking for an opportunity to take revenge. This revenge can take mforms, from leading horses astray to contaminating food supplies to directing larger monsters toward the begrudged creature. One of the most direct and unwelcome revenges of the jinkins is the destruction or cursing of magical items. Mtimes they'll observe camped enemies from a distance and either steal an item to tinker with it or just use their tinkering magic at a distance to annoy the item's owner. Once a jinkin has worked its sabotage on a stolen item, the jinkin either grows bored with the item or may attempt to return it to its owner. Jinkin lairs are often cluttered with stolen items that bear curses the jinkins themselves have forgotten all about. Dwarves in particular hate jinkins, with numerous tales in their folklore telling of tragedy at the hands of the gremlins. The loathing is largely mutual. The average jinkin stands almost 2 feet tall and weighs about 13 pounds.",400
Jinmenju,11,plant,temperate hills or mountains,"A low hum surrounds this huge, gnarled tree. The rotten fruits that hang from its sickly branches look vaguely like human heads, and each fleshy melon drips with a thick rope of ooze.","One of the more disquieting plants native to Tian Xia, the jinmenju is an eerie tree that grows in hillsy regions far from civilization. While a jinmenju otherwise appears to be nothing more than a twisted, gnarled cherry tree, the fruit that hangs from its branches makes it impossible to mistake for other flora, for each fleshy melon possesses the semblance of a human head. In their natural form, a jinmenju's head-fruits-which sag from the branches and look entirely too heavy for the short, stringy vines they hang from-resemble dark brown melons with vaguely humanoid facial features. A jinmenju can alter these head-fruits to resemble virtually form, making the rotting melons attractive or at least intriguing to potential prey. Using its ability to delve into nearby creatures' memories, a jinmenju simulates the appearance of whichever creature  will draw prey within range of its branches, which it uses to pummel enraptured creatures to unconsciousness before devouring them. A jinmenju's head-fruit retains a magical connection to the tree that bore it, so even after it is lopped from its branch, a transformed melon still bears the likeness chosen by the jinmenju, though the tree's compulsion effects remain distinctly tied to the tree itself. Ecology A jinmenju's head-fruits are covered in a thick skin that is easy to bite into, with an outmost layer similar in texture to that of a lumpy peach. Whenever potential prey nears a jinmenju, it wills its fruit to prematurely begin the rotting process. In addition to enticing its prey with hallucinations, a jinmenju can instantly ferment its head-fruits, emitting a sweet, intoxicating odor that lures creatures to the tree and captivates them. Those who have tasted a head-fruit and lived to tell of the experience claim that the fruit's flesh has a mushy consistency that makes it hard to hold in one's hands, and as it slips from one's grip, the world seems to melt away as well. Jinmenjus are remarkably intelligent and versatile plants, and can augment their illusions by creating sounds to further convince creatures that the false images they are seeing are real as they near the trees' head-fruits. By making minute alterations to the structure of its dense but flexible bark, a jinmenju can produce a series of cracks, shudders, and pops that can be combined to imitate almost sound, including a creature's voice or bursts of noise capable of damaging and deafening the tree's enemies. While a jinmenju can communicate in the common language of those it most often encounters, it rarely does so unless it has been given a suitable gift or is forced to speak by some other means. Habitat & Society Jinmenjus are found primarily in hillsy and mountains regions, far from civilization whose residents might seek to put an end to such a deceptive and ravenous creature. Eternally patient, jinmenjus usually reside in the same spot for hundreds of years, only changing locales if their current location runs out of food for an extended period of time. While most jinmenjus are simply hungry predators that have no interest in interacting with other intelligent creatures, some will communicate with others if given payment in the form of food, though mjinmenjus also desire particular magical or mundane objects they have learned of while scanning their targets' memories throughout the years. Once it has been befriended, a jinmenju may provide creatures with some of its vast wealth of acquired memories, though such a relationship is tenuous in the extreme, and only the most hardy creatures can withstand a jinmenju's magic long enough to provide the tree with an offering and ask for its knowledge. Brave or foolhardy adventurers seeking knowledge of their ancestors or perhaps lost loved ones may seek a jinmenju, hoping its expansive collection of memories might contain clues or information about the person they seek. Even if such folk do manage to convince the fickle tree to share some enlightening memory, they are often heartbroken when the jinmenju callously informs the memory-seekers afterward that it killed and devoured their sought-after friend, and so those who dare seek a jinmenju's knowledge should be careful of what questions they ask.",12800
Jinushigami,20,outsider,any,This enormous amalgamation of stone and plant matter takes the shape of an old man leaning on an equally huge staff.,"Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami  are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great inf luence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature. Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers. Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely. A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid affectations like hats or jewelry. ELDER JINUSHIGAMI Of all the kami, land kami are the most ancient and powerful, yet even among these immense outsiders there are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountains range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range's tallest mountains is even more so. When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit Dice-most are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami's ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional spell-like abilities to more closely ref lect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples. Glacier Kami: An elder jinushigami associated with a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs along a polar coastlines, appears as a humanoid made of blocks of ice. These kami have the cold subtype instead of the earth subtype , and can use cone of cold and wall of ice as spell-like abilities three times per day each. Great Reef Kami: An elder jinushigami whose domain contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears as a humanoid constructed of living coral draped with seaweed. Great reef kami have the waters subtype instead of the earth subtype, gain the waters subtype , gain a swim speed of 60 ft., and gain the ability to use tsunami  once per day as a spell-like ability. mountains Kami: When an elder jinushigami's ward includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the use of flesh to stone and wall of stone three times per day each. Volcano Kami: An elder jinushigami that includes in its ward an active volcano appears as a humanoid made of equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype , can use fireball three times per day as a spell-like ability, and can use wall of lava  once per day as a spell-like ability.",307200
Jinx Eater,2,humanoid,any,"Black feathers cover this crow-headed swashbuckler, his hands and legs ending in powerful talons. He wields a long, curved sword and wears brightly colored studded leather armor.","Perhaps nowhere in the Inner Sea region are tengus a more common sight than aboard a pirate vessel in the Shackles. Superstitious by nature, msailors in this region have assigned to these feathered humanoids the dual role of good luck charm and mascot, based on the misguided belief that tengus can absorb ill omens and bad luck. Where this notion came from is anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn such tengus, referred to as ""jinx eaters,"" some special treatment aboard ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conf licts altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn and steel. Jinx eaters are typically mad for plunder, especially seeking out jewelry and other such baubles, at times even lifting them from unsuspecting shipmates. Such pilfering inevitably leads to angry confrontations onboard, and the kleptomaniacal tengu must rely on his reputation as a source of good luck if he is to be spared a severe beating at the hands of his cohorts. Several settlements around the Shackles host rookeries of decent size, and it is common to find retired jinx eaters in such districts; often these are particularly boastful individuals who have given up on the life at sea or have been ousted from their old ship by their increasingly jaded crew members.",600

Exclusively female, jorogumos must mate with humanoids to produce fertile eggs. After copulation, a jorogumo paralyzes her partner by poisoning him into a coma. She lays a single egg within the father's body, then cocoons the corpse and hides the victim. Periodic visits to re-poison the victim ensure his coma lasts for the 2d4 days required for the young jorogumo to hatch and feed. Jorogumos are enthusiastic enemies of tengus and attack them on sight-they never take tengus as ""mates.""",19200
Jotund Troll,15,humanoid,cold hills or mountains,"This immense green-skinned brute wields a tree branch for a club and has nine heads, each filled with jutting teeth and tusks.","Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years. The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements. Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions.",51200

Kakuen-taka,14,outsider,any,Within a towering structure of bone and rotting flesh lurk hundreds of flittering fiends.,"In the far northern lands bordering on the Worldwound, a strange and terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairie-shambling fleshy abominations called kakuen-taka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds, a living manifestation of the Worldwound's taint whose horrific onset is presaged by a sour-sweet wind and wheeling, screaming flocks of undead birds. The lucky victims of the birds' blinding poison are spared the sight of the rumbling juggernauts of putrefying meat driven like siege engines by a swarm of fiends called bhogas. Individually these fiends have little wit or skill, but together they have a malign intellect that allows them to construct mobile nests out of dead flesh like morbid termites building a mound. The bhogas find a giant, mammoth, or other creature of great size and devour its organs, usually while the creature is still alive and trying to resist. Once the creature is dying or dead, the fiends reconfigure the corpse's remaining flesh and bone into a hideous, multilegged pillar, which they then invade and inhabit like a hollow tree. Some of the bhogas use their collective strength to move the fleshy mansion's limbs while the rest clamber about its walls or skulk underneath it, searching for new prey to terrorize and consume. This monstrosity attracts birds the fiends animate as flesh-craving undead swarms. Together, the three components of this peculiar Ecology stalk the demon-tainted lands. If a healthy swarm discovers another suitable corpse, the fiends engage in a frenzy of mating, build a second flesh mansion, split into two swarms, then rapidly give birth to fill all the available space in their new home. When a flesh mansion becomes so rotted that it cannot maintain its structure or the swarm cannot easily move it, the bhogas abandon their creation and seek out another, leaving behind a monstrous, decaying shell, unrecognizable as the living creature it once was. Necromancers can use the husk for parts or animate the entire thing as a new abomination. Desperate ghouls, zombies, or animals might feed on it and become tainted by its latent Abyssal energies. As much a plague upon demons as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from that might interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful demon might enslave one with magic and use the swarm's dimensional snare ability to capture and kill its rivals. Driven out of the central part of the Worldwound by more intelligent and organized demons, kakuen-taka have become a recurring plague in the southern fringes of the territory, below Storasta and abutting the borders with Numeria and Ustalav. In these lonely moors and hills, kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements. None of the adjacent countries values the empty lands highly enough to risk major resources to stamp them out. Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food, several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but over time they usually wander apart, following their separate carrionstorms, and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades.",38400

Kamadan,4,magical beast,temperate or warm plains,"This large leopard has six colorful snakes, hissing and ready to strike, sprouting from its shoulders.","Although kamadans are certainly magical creatures, they share mpsychological and sociological traits with other big cats. Even when hunting alone to avoid competition, a kamadan is often a member of a larger pride. In areas where wildlife or natives are more powerful, kamadan packs are more likely to hunt as a unit. Kamadans prefer underground lairs, but settle for rocky outcroppings or dens inside brambles or other thick bushes, and they use their snakes to manipulate the bones and baubles of their prey into decorative arrangements. Occasionally, a kamadan shares its lair with another creature, but only if the other creature is more powerful or plies the kamadan regularly with tributes of food and treasure.

Kaminari,17,outsider,"temperate skies, hills, or mountains","This enormous humanoid possesses vibrant green skin and equally loud hair, and is surrounded by a ring of huge drums and storm clouds.","Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards- enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums. Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons. Ecology Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its ward to travel in particular direction or halt its movement for a modest amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds of a storm. Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time. Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate creature-mortal or otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a deserts city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their punishments more destructive. Habitat & Society Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine. A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with thunder and lightning. A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the most talented bard might have trouble keeping up. A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are usually found amid deserts-quenching storms that wander arid environments, bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string instruments tend toward oceansic environs, residing within the hearts of devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice and snow that constantly whip about them.",102400

Kappa,2,monstrous humanoid,lakes or rivers,"This humanoid turtle crouches near the waters, a suspicious look in its eyes. The top of its bowl-shaped head is filled with waters.","A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid turtle. It dwells in freshwaters, preferring a stream or rivers to a lakes or pond. It has a small shell on its back, a blunt face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short claws. A typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can vary toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow basin in the top of its head, in which the creature carries waters from its home at all times. Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those who pass near or swim in their home. Kappa pranks are usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking under robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an waters predator. A kappa might also challenge others to grappling matches, hoping potential foes underestimate its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be dangerous, attempting to drown mounts, animal companions, or even people who enter its home waters. The most degenerate kappas have been known to drown bathers and eat them. Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures have a few weaknesses. First of all, kappas love cucumbers and horsef lesh. If plied with such treats, a kappa is likely to not bother intruders, and might even be convinced to offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks, it is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa confronted with a verbal rebuke rather than combat quickly and almost shamefully apologizes for its pranks, begging for forgiveness. If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains stationary and pleads for help, continuing to fight only if forced to. An opponent who refills the kappa's head bowl after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude. Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry flasks of waters with them when they are forced to travel far from their home-most kappa don't think this far ahead.",600
Kapre,10,plant,warm or temperate forests,"Roots and branches twist across the body of this huge, oddly proportioned humanoid to form impressive knots of muscle. Its meyes shine with a warm glow like burning embers.","Vehement defenders of unusual natural locations, kapres have a complicated relationship with the ""civilized"" races. Formed of dense tree matter, they are as much part of the forests as their botanical brethren. Their intimidating physical size, territorial nature, and unusual approach to friendship often bring them into conf lict with tribesmen and aggressive explorers. Furthermore, misleading myths paint them as vicious wife-stealers, violent demons, and even bringers of riches to those who can trap them. In truth, these arboreal giants are only dangerous to those who threaten the environs under their protection. With slender limbs and thick, gnarled torsos made of twisted trunks and boughs, kapres are awkwardly humanoid in appearance, but have such rich personalities that those lucky enough call them ""friend"" see them as more people than plants. Festooned with hanging vines or seasonal blossoms, kapres blend in perfectly with the surrounding forests. Were it not for the soft glow of their eyes, they could be mistaken for treants. Exceedingly secretive and wary, kapres prefer to avoid conf lict where possible, using their imposing size and confounding auras to intimidate would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee from the locations the kapre protects. Even in peaceful discussions, they rarely drop their auras, aware that the most honeyed tongue can hide the cruelest intent. If things turn sour, they deal out fast and serious damage with their great wooden fists, and if their domain is breached, they fight to the death to turn invaders away. Though kapres are fearsome when their ire is raised, they are careful  enough to allow retreating aggressors to escape. Ecology Much of the mystery that surrounds kapres is their own doing. Although shy, they enjoy the compof other humanoids and sometimes fixate on a particular creature, often a human female. This obsession manifests as playful teasing, using their confounding auras to befuddle the objects of their affections or keep others from visiting the women. Creatures that have a tolerance for trickery can become firm friends with the tree giants, earning protection, advice, and even romance. However, those who misunderstand these complex behaviors or those close to the ""victim"" can sour the reputation of kapres by reacting with jealousy and rage and branding kapres as dangerous or scheming. Rumors that capturing a kapre will force it to grant wishes were almost certainly started by a jealous chieftain whose wife caught a kapre's eye. These mixed reactions have kept kapres cautious and encouraged them to develop methods of identifying and escaping traps. Their caution keeps them always ready to leap over a trip wire, snare, or spiked pit. They know their own terrain inside out, and constantly keep an ear to the ground, using their speak with plants ability to stay on top of changes for mmiles around. Habitat & Society Each kapre chooses a location sacred or important to it, which it then defends with its life. The reasons for choosing a particular location might make little sense to other creatures, and when pressed a kapre usually gives a cryptic or evasive explanation. This has proved frustrating for mwould-be road builders or bush farmers who cannot quite understand why a half-acre of swamps should be of interest to anyone. Furthermore, the location a kapre chooses to defend is not always where it resides, and invading a kapre's home is almost as dangerous as sullying a sacred place. It is not uncommon for a careful explorer who has given a kapre's sacred spot a wide berth to end up the target of the creature's fury when the new route runs directly through the clearing the creature calls home. A kapre's home is usually easy to identify, and resembles a druid's grove: a clearing, carefully and sensitively pruned, with a single massive tree at its center. KapreCigars Kapres roll thick cigars, using a recipe so secret  that neither tobacconist nor alchemist can identify the ingredients. Even in the chaos of combat their enormous cigars never fall from their mouths; their thick-skinned stogies interfere with their speech, lending a lazy drawl to their creaky voices. Kapre Cigar Aura faint evocation and necromancy; CL 7 Slot none; Price 2,250 gp; Weight 4 lbs. DESCRIPTION A kapre's 2-foot-long cigar never goes out. It burns with a glow that sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the cigar is dangerous for but a kapre-and not just because of its size. Only a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours. Once inhaled, the smoke can be exhanled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action. Creatures caught in the smoky cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a kapre or creation must be completed under the supervision of a kapre; Cost 1,125 gp",9600
Kathlin,3,magical beast,temperate plains,"This creature resembles a blackish-brown warhorse that rears, exposing six muscular legs and terrible hooves.","Kathlins are powerful, six-legged horses that spend their time roaming the temperate plains they call home. They generally avoid contact with civilized races, preferring the seclusion of their homeland above all else. Kathlin congregate in herds and two types of herds can be encountered; bachelor or mixed. A bachelor herd consists of all males. Each male in such a herd is young and hasn't reached full maturity yet. The second type of kathlin herd is a mixed herd that contains both females and males. In a mixed herd there will always be at least one male for every three females . When a bachelor male reaches maturity, it leaves the bachelor herd and seeks out a mixed herd where it selects up to three females to mate with. Should the kathlin select a female that is mated with another male, a battle ensues. The male that wins this fight claims the female as its own. Kathlins can be trained as mounts or beasts of burden. Young are usually easier to train than older kathlins, and males make better mounts than females. They can also be trained to serve as a mount in combat. They are fearless creatures and do quite well in such situations. Trained properly, a kathlin makes an excellent combat steed. When fighting, a kathlin rears back on its hind legs and slashes with its hooves or gnashes at a foe with its bite. Non-domesticated or untrained kathlin back away from combat if overwhelmed. They do not do so out of fear, but are intelligent enough to know when they are beaten. Training a Kathlin A kathlin requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a kathlin must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly kathlin requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a kathlin does not require an exotic saddle. A kathlin can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check. Kathlin young are worth 5,000 gp on the open market. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a kathlin. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a kathlin is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301 to 600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601 to 900 pounds. A kathlin can drag 4,500 pounds. Paladin's Mount A paladin of 6th level or higher may call a kathlin as his or her special mount. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene",800
Kech,3,monstrous humanoid,warm forests,This hairless simian's leathery skin has a camouf lage pattern to it that shifts and changes as the creature moves.,"Not quite man nor ape, the kech is a hairless primate that dwells in the deepest jungles. There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a kech's flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds. These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined junglesbuildings, and when presented with an opportunity to seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in, the typical kech tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as cruel as they are stealthy, and most junglesvillages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed. A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4 levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungleshas no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained guard apes among them. Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids.",800

Kelp Devil,8,plant,temperate or warm waters,A large colony of seaweed about 20 feet or more in diameter covers the nearby area.,"Kelp devils are relatives of kelpies and are believed to have once been of that race before being subjected to vile and evil experiments that placed them in their current state. To the casual observer, the kelp devil resembles a large colony of slow moving seaweed about 20 feet in diameter. A closer look reveals six 10-foot long pseudopods extending from its body. Kelp devils are patient creatures. They lie perfectly motionless until potential prey moves within 10 feet. Once their prey is within range, they strike quickly with their pseudopods, attempting to grab an opponent. Grappled creatures are dragged underwaters and drowned. Slain creatures are devoured by the kelp devil. Credit The Kelp Devil originally appeared in the Second Edition module Return to White Plume mountains  and is used by permission.

Kelpie,4,plant,waters,"A beautiful human female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and milky-white skin sits nearby. She is cloaked in a robe of green seaweed.","In their true form, kelpies are indistinguishable from normal seaweed. They are found in saltwaters and freshwaters, swamps, fens, and stagnated underground pools and lakes. Sages and scholars believe the kelpies were created by an evil waters elemental goddess. In her human guise, a kelpie appears as a beautiful female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and soft, pale skin. She is cloaked in robes of seaweed or wears nothing at all. A kelpie often assumes a semi-human form in which her lower torso is composed entirely of seaweed. Kelpies lie in wait for their foes, and when a target moves within range, they reshape their form to appear human  so as to lure the target closer. If the ruse is not detected and the opponent moves within 5 feet of the kelpie, she attacks, attempting to charm and drown her victim. Drowned foes are taken back to the kelpie's lair and devoured.

Kelpie's Wrath,15,outsider,waters,"The skull of some many-fanged sea monster adorns the bow of this ominous pirate vessel, a grim ship made all the more disturbing by its apparent lack of a crew.","Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of mhorror tales of abandoned ships found in the oceans or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dream-realms in search of plunder, danger, and glory. The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastlines village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the waters, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb. The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects  using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful. Ecology Kelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can ""swim"" in direction, including underwaters, it may be found on the surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the oceans. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to retreat deep underwaters  or use teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Mloot caches on the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory for later counting. When called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services, preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous, voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets, though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious shipwreck in a cove. The ship is fully mobile in waterslike environments on other planes, including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the ""waters"" of the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watersy parts of the Abyss, though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in the terrain that would trap it. Habitat & Society Kelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject fear of punishment for perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her. Though the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to Pharasma's Boneyard.",51200
Kere,10,outsider,any,"This unnaturally pale woman is dressed in the somber garb of a mourner, her countenance covered by a lengthy black veil.","Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces disregard the fundamental sanctity of such ground-mortal and deathless heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous otherworldly guardian. Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the Boneyard, the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life. While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship derives not from otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend. Keres appear as pale, sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds. Ecology As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind, keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful ghosts and mythical beings from storytellers' tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead- out of a loathing for such perverse creatures-their unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation. Habitat & Society A kere's exact methods usually matter little, as they tend to keep to more vulnerable, remote cemeteries, and prove most active when night cloaks the dark deeds of trespassers. But, occasionally, overzealous keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not. More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking psychopomps often find the added excitement isn't worth the bother. For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath.",9600
Khaei,3,monstrous humanoid,underground,"This short, stunted humanoid is bald and has weirdly twisted limbs, its body seeming to fade and come apart at the edges.","The khaei are a mystery even to themselves. Their twisted limbs give them an awkward, shambling gait, and their personalities are dull and incurious, making them seem in mways to be simply degenerate humans. At the same time, their bodies' tendency to trail off into mist and shadow, combined with their weird magical attack, suggests they could be much more. A typical khaei stands 4 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds. By far the most unusual aspect of the khaei is their ability to manipulate time. A khaei in fear for her life can grab an attacker and forcefully age him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe's body. This exertion does damage to the khaei as well, and thus is rarely used, but a would-be tyrant who considers the khaei easy pickings may find himself surrounded by a weeping mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude-then forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the khaei's existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a great event. Khaei live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their situation. The only known enclave of khaei in the Inner Sea region is in the Dark forests, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve as both subjects and prey for the mysterious dullahan called the Dark Rider. One of the most cherished stories of these khaei concerns a time and place-somewhere in either the past or the future- when there were mmore of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones.",800
Khargra,4,outsider,Elemental Plane of Earth,"This creature resembles a man-sized cylinder covered in metallic scales. It sports three large ""fins"" spaced even around its circumference. Between each fin is a metal sheath from which slide long claw-like arms. A large hole in the front of its cylindrical body is lined with msmall curved metallic teeth and seems to function as its mouth.","Khargras are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are usually only encountered on the Material Plane when summoned. On occasion, a khargra slips through a tear in the planar fabric and enters the Material Plane to digest ores and metals not normally found on its native plane. A khargra is a 5-foot long cylinder and weighs about 300 pounds. It is believed that khargras speak  Terran and Common, but no one is certain as communication with these creatures has always failed. Khargras attack from ambush, preferring to wait just inside the wall of a dungeon or corridor and springing out when prey passes nearby. The khargra attempts to grab and devour metal objects within the area. Nonmetallic objects may be bitten, but not devoured.

Kijimuna,2,humanoid,temperate or warm forests or coastlines,"At first glance, this creature appears to be a mischievously smiling young child with bright red hair clad only in a grass skirt. A closer look reveals goblinoid ears and a mouth full of pointed teeth.","The childlike kijimunas bear physical similarities to their Inner Sea cousins, the goblins, sharing their small size, leathery skin, and large, pointed ears. However, kijimunas' hair stands out as their most prominent features-long, wild manes of blazing red. These tricky creatures nearly always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them for trouble-making urchins. Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their ""play"" frustrates, harms, or otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more elaborate pranks. A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds. Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and climbing tall banyan trees. Ecology Consummate fishermen, kijimunas while away the hours fishing on the shores of oceans or large lakes. Although they delight in the taste of fish-especially the eyes- they easily grow bored and become distracted, sometimes leaving their fishing spears and a pile of fish to rot onshore. The creatures alleviate their boredom by playing tricks on fishermen and villagers living near their cavern or treetop homes. A kijimuna makes every effort to hide its involvement in the tricks it pulls, more out of a sense of pride about a well-executed joke than fear of reprisal. A young kijimuna grows to adulthood in a matter of 5 months, but retains its childish appearance for the entirety of its life. In the unlikely event that its activities don't cause its premature demise, the creature lives for about 15 years. An elderly kijimuna, having reached the ripe old age of 12, settles down and does little else beyond fish in solitude, except perhaps to bargain with children from nearby villages for its catch. It extracts a promise from a child in return for the fish, as well instructions for a devious prank or practical joke to pull on an elder. Although their societies and world view differ wildly from those of the goblins of the Inner Sea Region and elsewhere in Golarion, physiologically kijimuna are little different. As true goblinoids, sort of device, concoction, or magical effect that only affects goblins affects these erratic tricksters as well. Habitat & Society Tribes of kijimunas maintain small lairs in seaside caves, amid groves of banyan trees, or in other secluded, enclosed areas near the shore. Their homes typically stink of rotten fish from catches brought home and promptly forgotten, while the walls often bear half-completed diagrams of pranks members intend to pull on neighboring creatures. Kijimunas rarely pull pranks on each other, mostly because they hold their peoples' cleverness in high regard, and believe that it's impossible to trick their own kind. Occasionally, however, some event leaves a kijimuna the victim of some accidental hilarity- well-placed meal scraps left on its face, tripping into a tide pool, falling down-such occurrences are the height of kijimuna comedy. Much like their Inner Sea cousins, kijimunas have a strong, bizarre hatred for a particular creature-in this case, the octopus. When faced with octopuses, kijimunas either flee in terror or desperately attack, their whoops and howls vastly exaggerating the threat the cephalopods pose. Kijimunas often share frightening stories about octopuses at night, scaring one another with fearful tales of squirming tentacles and clutching suckers. Occasionally these stories incite groups to action, leading them to go on raids of local tide pools and rocky beaches where the sea creatures regularly lurk. The resulting battles prove loud but brief, with skewered octopuses and the occasional ""hostage"" taken as supplies for the goblinoids' most startling jokes. Kijimunas have few strong feelings about other animals, especially as predators more dangerous than large lizards and the occasional hunting cat rarely occupy the same lands that they do. They delight in sharing their homes with large tropical birds, however, a sentiment that is hardly reciprocated, as they frequently employ the creatures  in their pranks and take endless delight in mimicking the birds' squawking. Spiders, with their numerous legs, are generally avoided by kijimuna, mof which suspect the insects might be just miniature octopuses in disguise. Kijimunas share goblins' affinity for fire, but this attraction manifests in a less overtly destructive way. These creatures have developed secret techniques allowing them to befriend small fires, calling such flames to them to light their paths, lead travelers into their pranks, or steal a lantern's ability to hold a light. No kijimunas remember how their people managed to make friends with small fires, just that they did a long time ago. Large fires remain dangerous to kijimunas, however, and not only do they have no power over such blazes, but they generally have nothing pleasant to say about flame larger than a campfire. Kijimunas often form relationships with other humanoids who fish along the same shore. Some befriend such creatures, eagerly sharing all manner of trivial secrets-where the best fishing spots are, what trees grow the stinkiest fruit, and which rocks octopuses hardly ever visit. As a show of friendship, kijimunas make their companions favored targets for particularly embarrassing practical jokes. Those of a superstitious bent view kijimunas as evil spirits, pointing to the ghostly flames that often follow the creatures and their mischievous behavior as proof. Once in a while, someone discovers kijimunas' hatred for octopuses and carries one around as a ward. This typically backfires spectacularly, as the kijimunas then focus their ire on the person-who is obviously some sort of octopus spy or ally. Kijimunas reserve their most elaborate tricks for cephalopod sympathizers. The only counter to most humanoids' distrust and wariness regarding kijimunas manifests in times of famine or poor fishing seasons. In numerous such cases, a town on the brink of starvation has found its food stores replenished on a daily basis by an energized tribe of kijimunas, as these creatures apply their considerable fishing talents to feed their neighbors. After all, kijimunas realize that corpses are considerably less entertaining than living creatures, especially when serving as the butts of jokes. Thus, most communities accept that if their benefactors happen to play a trick or two on them, matters could be far worse.",600

Kobold,0.25,humanoid,temperate underground or deep forests,"This short, reptilian humanoid has scaled skin, a snout filled with tiny teeth, and a long tail.","Kobolds are creatures of the dark, found most commonly in enormous underground warrens or the dark corners of the forests where the sun is unable to reach. Due to their physical similarities, kobolds loudly proclaim themselves the scions of dragonkind, destined to rule the earth beneath the wings of their great god-cousins, but most dragons have little use for the obnoxious pests. While they may speak loudly of divine right and manifest destiny, kobolds are keenly aware of their own weakness.

Kodama,5,outsider,forests,This little green humanoid figure stands only three feet tall. Its head is faceless save for two hollow pits for eyes.,"Revered by druids and rangers for their attunement with the wilds, kodama, known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the forests-they do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas.  A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forests that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area. A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so mtrees tends to diminish the singular ""presence"" single tree might have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their race-take the path of the monk. Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel , yet the end result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama, few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat distracted by the kami's attention. When a kodama must fight , it moves quickly-kodama work best in groups, and when confronted alone generally use tree stride to travel to another part of the forests to raise a small host of allies to aid",1600
Kolyarut,12,outsider,any,"Beneath its cloak, this man-shaped creature appears to be part statue and part metallic machine.","Kolyaruts are enforcers of bargains, traveling to the very edges of the planes in order to punish oath-breakers and see that contracts are kept. They care little for the terms of the agreements in question, only that promises are fulfilled, debts are paid, and balance is maintained. Least conspicuous of the inevitables, even in their natural form, kolyaruts are the size of tall humans, though they weigh far more because of their composition. Capable of using both invisibility and disguise self to pass completely unnoticed through humanoid lands, kolyaruts most frequently appear as cloaked warriors bearing finely crafted bastard swords, allowing others to chalk up metallic noises to the clanking of hidden armor until the moment when they pull back their hoods and let their quarries look upon their mechanical faces, understanding only too late the nature of the mysterious strangers. Perhaps because their missions can be the murkiest and most open to interpretation, kolyaruts are by far the most talkative of the inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use both to assist them in gathering information on their targets and in issuing challenges  on the battlefield. Though naturally as solitary as their kindred, kolyaruts are occasionally content to let members of other races tag along and assist them in achieving shared goals, though they have little problem abandoning or even exploiting these ""comrades"" if it brings them closer to fulfilling their mission.",19200
Kongamato,15,dragon,tropical forests,"A massive draconic creature with a birdlike head dives from the skies, letting loose a piercing scream as it descends.","Kongamatos are primeval dragons that hunt the deep jungles of the world. Although not as intelligent or magically adept as their ""true"" cousins, kongamatos are respected and feared for their resilience and awesome strength. While the kongamato's body is clearly draconic- squat and dense with sharp claws capping each of its four limbs-the creature's head is distinctly avian, with a long, toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A kongamato's hide is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly and crimson webbing on its broad wings. Females have smaller head-crests than males, and a rosy hue colors both the undersides of their wings and their underbellies. Kongamatos are apex predators that make their lairs in the tops of the oldest and strongest trees, or in caves and ruins. Kongamatos are carnivorous and prey on large herd animals. Although they do not have teeth, their beaks are sharp and strong, allowing them to carve their kills with precision and to punch through wood, rock, and even metal. When possible, kongamatos hunt on the perimeter of their territories, gliding silently and gracefully through even the thickest forests foliage to surprise prey. Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30 feet, with an equally broad wingspan, and can weigh up to 7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and 600 years.",51200
Korir-kokembe,10,dragon,warm jungles,"This green-tined dragon has multiple sets of legs down its long, sinuous body. An oversized gullet bulges in its throat.","Korir-kokembe live in the deep, watersy jungles of central Garund, plaguing the major rivers and lakes systems. While young korir-kokembe may swim near populated watersways to claim their prey, their elder kin prefer more remote backwaters, sloughs, and heavily wooded swamps where they can hunt undisturbed. These degenerate dragons live in a violent symbiosis with the tiny vermin that infest the jungles, hosting colonies of such creatures within their own bodies. Such tiny vermin constantly swarm in and out of the korir-kokembe's gullet, bringing contagion to creatures bitten and allowing the wyrm to expel swarms of pests, or to summon yet more vermin to its aid. While korir-kokembe are capable of flight, they generally prefer to crawl or climb on their eight legs, hunching their bodies like inchworms or twining their coils around their prey while savaging creatures with a barrage of slashing claws.",9600

Its hair is dark and its wild, brown eyes have an almost feral-like gleam in them.","Armed with a club that seems too large for it to wield, a korred is a satyrlike creature that dwells deep in the forests. Korreds keep their belongings in a large pouch; the contents of such a pouch vary with the tastes of the individual, but all korreds carry shears with which to cut their matted hair when it becomes too long.

Kostchtchie,23,outsider,any,"This hulking creature stands to be at least 9 or 10 feet tall with yellowish skin. His head and body seem to be completely hairless save for his thick, bushy eyebrows. Two massive stump-like legs support his thick, misshapen torso and great, gnarled arms extend from his shoulders. His head is flat and oval and sports two, large sunken crystal-blue eyes.","Kostchtchie is the demon lord of cold and the prince of wrath; he is the epitome of hatred and evil. If there is a demon lord more ruthless and malevolent than he, that lord has never made his presence known. Kostchtchie is hated by all . He moves across his Abyssal landscape with a shuffling gait, and is rarely, if ever, encountered alone. Kostchtchie is revered by some frost giant shamans as a god. Various clans pay tribute to him in the form of humanoid sacrifices  and often invoke his blessing before undertaking a great quest or entering a great battle. Kostchtchie's Abyssal home is a frigid and mountains realm of ice, rock, snow, and subfreezing temperatures. Unprotected travelers and those vulnerable to cold do not last long here. Kostchtchie stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Kostchtchie fights with his oversized warhammer in battle. He is relentless in his attack and seeks to kill all interlopers he encounters.

Kraken,18,magical beast,oceans,"This tremendous leviathan resembles a vast squid, yet the markings on its body are strangely unsettling to look upon.","The legendary kraken is one of the greatest of sailors' fears, for here is a creature the size of a whale, one that can strike from the unseen depths below, can command the winds and weather that a ship needs to move, and possesses the cruel intellect of the world's most creative and spiteful criminals. Some believe krakens to be a punishment of the gods, while others hold them to be the true lords of the deep, with the air-breathing races naught but their cattle.

Krenshar,1,magical beast,temperate forests or plains,"This earless, panther-like beast snarls as the skin of its face twitches, then peels back to reveal the bone and flesh beneath.","The krenshar is a strange creature that resembles a large but earless hunting cat, save that it can retract the fur and skin on its face to reveal the glistening skull and musculature underneath. Combined with its strange, keening wail, this horrifying display is enough to paralyze prey and send formidable opponents running. Krenshar's retractable skin allows it to dine on carrion with a lower risk of picking up disease-carrying vermin, much like a vulture's bare head and neck. When the creature finishes eating, restoring the facial skin to its normal position scrapes off gore and clinging bugs. The ability to retract their skin is demonstrated in other contexts as well-male krenshars bare their skulls at rivals as a challenge over mates, females use this ability to ward off undesired suitors, and hunting adults use it to scare prey into ambushes. Though krenshars generally prefer to stalk herd animals like deer or cattle, they have no qualms about taking on humanoids when food is scarce. They average 4 to 5 feet in length and weigh approximately 175 pounds. Scholars have long debated the confusing nature of krenshar intelligence. While clearly more intelligent than mere animals, the creatures seem to lack all but the most rudimentary language of snarls and yowls, and aside from the scare tactics that make them notorious, tend to behave much like mundane cats or wolves, even going so far as to occasionally be befriended by rangers or druids. Those who deny krenshars' intelligence, however, need only look into their strange violet eyes or observe the ease with which they manipulate and outmaneuver their prey to realize their folly-an error few make twice.",400
Kronosaurus,10,animal,warm oceans,"This enormous, finned reptile has a long mouth full of sharp teeth and moves through the waters with incredible speed.","The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless hunter that, once it picks up a potential meal's scent, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is sated. A kronosaurus's diet consists of everything from large fish and sharks to small whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own.

Kuah-lij,0.33,humanoid,land,"This creature resembles a gnome that has been stretched vertically to a height of a human. Its features are knobby and elongated. Its hair is light and downy, more akin to a soft fur than anything else, and its skin is white with pale blue undertones.","The kuah-lij are a race of humanoids that inhabit a distant world orbiting a great red sun. They are lawful and organized, but a dying people due to a series of disasters on their home world, and now search for aid. For several millennia, the kuah-lij lived in relative peace on an old world in an advanced civilization, though much of the technology was magic-based. This changed with a series of plagues that devastated the population, followed by a gradual, inexplicable advancement of the size of their oceans. Huge floods resulted. These cataclysms were followed by the invasion of a ferocious waters race resembling the aboleths. The aboleth-like creatures lurked in the deepest oceans trenches of the kuah-lij planet, and attacked by coming up from the depths. The kuah-lij, accomplished artisans, retaliated by building a series of magically enhanced sea craft to travel the deeps and attack these beings. Thus far they have arrived at a stalemate, and the kuah-lij now seek aid from other worlds and planes in their battle against their deepwaters adversaries. Individual kuah-lij commoners rely upon their military and combat specialists to protect them. With their focus on magical technology, they have easy access to a great mmagical devices which they can use to defend themselves with as well. The Kuah-lij were at one time a peaceful race of explorers, living in an organized society on a distant planet orbiting a great red sun. Though the course of their lives was regimented, their culture allowed them scope for individuality, and in fact encouraged it. This, and the natural propensity of the kuah-lij for order, resulted in a society that had remained fresh and vigorous for over 10,000 years. Kuah-lij young are placed into a public crèche to be raised within days of birth, to be raised by child care specialists. As they grow and are educated, their affinities and talents are assessed, and at age 15 they are assigned a vocation, based on their talents, and an avocation, based on their preferences. They then study more intensely in these two areas, until they reach maturity at age 25. Kuah-lij youths have the option of changing vocation or avocation if they insist upon it, though this almost never occurs. Upon reaching maturity, they fully enter society, where they spend 10 months of the year working at their vocation 10 hours per day, and the final two months on sabbatical, traveling, exploring, or doing whatever else strikes them as interesting. Their culture is based on a complex system of credit, with currency reserved only for dealing with non-kuahlij, and medicine, vacation time, and other services are all socialized, but due to their innately organized, cooperative mindset, there is remarkably little corruption within their culture. The kuah-lij had civilized their planet millennia ago, and had settlements across its lands and beneath its seas. Mareas they deliberately kept undeveloped, and they took great pleasure in long sea voyages and extended exploration of back country. Their innate tendency to organized society also helped them immeasurably with mass production and technology, in particular a merging of science and magic. Though it never reached the pinnacles seen in other exotic cross-planar cultures, it was highly polished, with mof their technological marvels being as much works of art as useful items. This idyllic existence came to an end over 300 years ago, when a strange darkness crept into the deepest places of their oceans. Kuah-lij explorers that investigated did not return, or came back reporting nothing amiss-but with a strange gleam in their eyes. They merged back into the kuah-lij culture, and immediately set about sabotaging it, destroying it from within. Despite their placid lives, the kuah-lij had mthousands of years of history to draw upon, and were able to take this in stride. Yet even as they isolated the tainted members of their society and set about investigating the cause of this in detail, the invaders of the deeps began to strike, poisoning food supplies, then attacking Kuah-lij undersea cities, often overwhelming them without warning or survivors. As the years passed, the kuah-lij culture became more militant, fighting a war against a race they had almost no information about. The battle has entered a kind of stalemate: the Kuah-lij have msea-based vessels and devices to use against their foes, but the enemies of the deep, which resemble aboleths, are surmised to have secret aid from an extraplanar source, and also apparently limitless numbers. The kuah-lij have turned some of their efforts to exploring distant worlds, in this plane and beyond, for answers to the origins of their attackers, and how to deal with them. This is their single, overriding concern. Kuah-lij Characters Kuah-lij are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Kuchrima,8,monstrous humanoid,mountains,"This vaguely humanoid creature has a vulture's head and wings for arms, and wields an enormous bow in its taloned feet.","These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors. Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts, but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect. Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate prey both small and large. In the extreme mountains areas they inhabit, such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountains aurochs, and even the occasional mountainseer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals dead and rotting. Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of desolate mountains ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or ""gluttonies."" They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to mountains regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters strive to remain well out of sight of land-bound races, which they mistrust and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again.",4800

Kuwa,4,outsider,any,"This golden-skinned fiend has horns, fangs, and bulging eyes. It grips a spiked club in its four-fingered claws.","While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and thus often end up having associations with giants and other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni who clothe themselves in human flesh. While their true forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin, claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns, kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans. As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind, and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often as guard captains, guildmasters , and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of command, but avoid positions so important that they have too meyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste, and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa increases its opportunities for such abuse. Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure, and like oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, like-minded humans to lead in banditry and worse. A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs 190 pounds.",1200
Kyton,6,outsider,any,"Wickedly barbed chains adorn this lean figure, and gaps in the bindings reveal deathly pale flesh etched with jagged scars.","Often classified among the ranks of the infernal and called chain devils by the uninitiated, the sadomasochistic kytons are not true devils. Although some are known to live in Hell, kytons exist outside of the hierarchies established by Asmodeus and his archdevils and can often be found on other planes, particularly on the Plane of Shadow. Msuggest that kytons were natives of Hell who existed there before the advent of devilkind, while others hypothesize they were later brought to the plane by some sadistic power. Regardless of their origins, kytons roam the planes in their lust to cause and receive suffering, seeking pain through violent abductions and sadistic debauches. The kyton presented here is a typical member of this fiendish race of outsiders, but is by no means the only type of its kind. Just as there are numerous different species of demon and devil, rumor holds that different kinds of kytons dwell in their jangling cities in Hell and on the Plane of Shadow. These kytons are invariably more powerful than the one presented here, often having spell-like abilities or hideous and unsettling special attacks along the themes of torture and pain.

Lacridaemon,3,outsider,any,"Sobbing uncontrollably, this gray-skinned creature possesses thin legs ending in black cloven hooves, as well as a ferocious, manic grin. Its flesh is torn and scratched even down to the tip of its misshapen tail, while a patchwork sheet of dirty ice covers its body. Its tears sizzle violently as they hit the ground.","Among the least powerful of Abaddon's daemons, though still exceedingly dangerous, lacridaemons personify death by neglect or exposure to the elements, such as that suffered by those who become lost in the wilderness and die far from help, or are trapped in an enclosed space  and left to slowly expire. Sadly, children are more likely to become lacridaemons than other type of daemon, and while it's rare for children to be truly evil, those unfortunate children who die from neglect and abuse, or who are abandoned by their parents, are at risk of being twisted and made savage by the experience. Lacridaemons' misery is in stark contrast to their savage nature, and given the opportunity, they viciously lash out, furiously attacking their mortal victims. Burning tears of acid and horrific powers used to strand mortals in perilous conditions make lacridaemons effective combatants against unwary enemies, and their abilities are compounded when the daemons are encountered as a wailing, weeping group. Ecology Pitiful creatures, most lacridaemons suffer in death as their mortal incarnations did in life, consumed by feelings of abandonment, self-pity, and a gnawing sense of loneliness. They often spawn from the souls of evil mortals who died alone and abandoned-exiled criminals, reclusive and corrupt nobles, or those who died from intense exposure to the natural elements, such as by freezing to death or dying of thirst. They are thus often servants of the Horseman of Famine, who makes use of their skills in luring mortals well beyond the edges of civilization, where they ultimately perish due to lack of nourishment. Wracked by an enduring and incurable loneliness even in death, these fiends yearn for the companionship they died without, but only so they can attack and prey upon the souls of those who denied them help in life. They still call out for aid, whispering with a subtle telepathy as well as calling out with weak, pleading voices, begging for help and comfort. In Abaddon, their calls mostly draw out the hunted-namely those evil souls of Abaddon who would seek to take advantage of a stranded innocent-while on the Material Plane they bring forth all manner of doomed altruists. They turn on those who arrive, attacking anyone who would show them the benevolence denied or unattainable to them in life. Of course, the very notion that their daemonic nature might be inf luenced by the dim memories of a mortal soul is disgusting to them, and most reject the idea as blasphemous. Habitat & Society Bef itting their nature, most lacridaemons wander the fringes of daemonic society, abhorring the cities and citadels that populate the greater realms of the Four and their subordinate lords. This self-selected exile has several consequences. First, it ensures that they, as a caste of daemons, receive only the scraps of mortal souls, and rarely does lacridaemon rise to a position of prominence within Abaddon. Their wandering also brings them into considerable conf lict with the various non-daemonic natives of Abaddon, including nightmares and night hags-but when confronted by powerful foes or outnumbered, lacridaemons usually simply flee. Lacridaemons take great pleasure in pursuing the hunted, leading the already stranded souls further astray throughout the vast wastelands of Abaddon. These hunted never die of starvation or malnourishment, instead subsisting in a constant state of agonizing hunger, and the lacridaemon takes great pleasure in causing such suffering. Solitary and xenophobic, lacridaemons shun the compof other creatures except for other lacridaemons, and even then the fiends largely just cluster together, interacting at a bare minimum. These small lurks of lacridaemons are especially dangerous when encountered in the wild; their maddening whines for help often cause entire parties of travelers to become disoriented and lose their way in treacherous lands. While on the Material Plane, lacridaemons gravitate toward hostile environs such as vast swaths of tundra, brutally hot deserts, and inhospitable swampslands. Occasionally, a lacridaemon will appear near the border of an oasis city or remote outpost, waiting for travelers to leave on the next leg of their journey. The lacridaemon will then follow the unwitting travelers at a distance, waiting until they are far from civilization before coming close enough to let its mind-affecting sobs be known. Lacridaemons use their pitiful whimpering to string prey along for days at a time, until the unfortunate victim has run out of food or waters and is on the brink of death. When this occurs, the cunning daemon finally confronts its prey, revealing the true source of the weeping. If it needs to attack, a lacridaemon does so swiftly, savoring the body and reveling in the death of yet another abandoned soul, shedding its perpetual tears all the while.",800
Lamia,6,monstrous humanoid,temperate deserts,"This creature's upper torso is that of a comely woman with cat's eyes and sharp fangs, while her lower body is that of a lion.","The hate-filled inheritors of an ancient curse, lamias appear as lean and attractive women from the waist up, while below they possess the bodies of powerful lions. Even their humanoid features bear distinctly feline traits, their eyes slitted and feral and their teeth like predatory fangs. A typical lamia stands over 6 feet tall, measures more than 8 feet long, and weighs upward of 650 pounds. Lamias are attracted to the ruined and forsaken parts of the world. Crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and forgotten monuments all satisfy these deadly hunters' cruel aesthetic- particularly those in arid or otherwise lifeless environs. Foremost, though, lamias favor decrepit temples. They delight in seeing the shrines of good deities in ruins and go out of their way to bring hardship to thriving holy places. Lamias look to the eldest female of the group as their leader, mother, and shaman, cleaving to her with fanatical reverence. While lamias shun most religious followings- viewing such as the source of the curse that blighted them with bestial forms-lamia elders claim to hear the whispers of the scouring deserts winds and know the cold whims of the stars, drawing upon such mystical sources to lead their people.

Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise and knowledgeable about those who would seek to do evil in their lands, mraces find lammasus arrogant, dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their superior attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse and sometimes insult these highly honorable creatures, who seek only to do good and aid those weaker than themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings, they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping to defeat evil. Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join their cause, bringing a lifetime of experience to struggle. This often makes them stern, but those who know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about those they protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and weigh approximately 900 pounds.",4800

Lantern Archon,2,outsider,any,"Shedding a warm and calming radiance, this orb of light moves with a preternatural silence and otherworldly grace.","Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly converse with and assist other creatures. Their bodies, however, are merely globes of spiritual purity and pale light, and though they might interact with their surroundings through pure force of will, such interaction proves too weak to help with most physical tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional at scouting-at least in areas where strange lights aren't unusual-relaying messages, and overwhelming enemies with surprise and group tactics. Although they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane attacks. A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light msettlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil. Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes. These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.",600
Lantern Goat,6,undead,mountains,"This creature resembles a goat with tangled and patchy gray-and-white hair, and horns and hooves that appear to be made of stone. Its eyes are stark white. Around its neck hangs a dented and ugly iron lantern, glowing with a foul amber light.","Lantern goats are undead wanderers thought to be the coalescence of souls of people who died while lost in the wilderness. Just as normal goats sometimes drift from the shepherd's care and fall prey to the dangers of the wild, so too do humans and demihumans often meet with a dire end while trekking alone in the hills. Whether they die of exposure or become a predator's meal, these lost travelers usually journey in spirit form to the afterlife. Some, however, if they perish too close to a lantern goat, find their souls drawn into the fell receptacle the creature wears around its neck. The scarred and battered lantern that depends from the goat's neck serves to channel souls into the creature itself. As the goat moves through the hills, its lantern casts a sickening yellow glow that attracts the souls of the recently deceased. Lantern goats roam low mountains and foothills damned to patrol the mortal realm in search of those who die alone. How the lantern goat behaves in combat depends upon the number of adversaries it faces. Normally the goat preys on lone travelers, attacking them with its stony hooves and horns. If it encounters a group, the lantern goat emits a fear light from its lantern, intending to panic everyone in range and then pick them off individually.

Lar,5,outsider,any,A stirring in the air and rustle through the room reveals a presence-a subtle aura both cautious and curious.,"Sometimes referred to as ""watchsouls,"" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons. Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable. Ecology Although formed upon the Upper Planes, lares find themselves drawn to the Material Plane. While some seek out mortal souls to watch over out of some innate sense of protectiveness, others feel a more specific draw, searching out members of specific races, nations, heritages, or families. Upon taking up residence in a home of their choosing, what motivates and sustains these benevolent spirits is little understood. They seem to take sustenance from positive emotions, growing weak if left in places with quarrelsome residents or that fall to ruin. Lares never seem to die from negative emotions or abandonment, though, merely biding their time in the hopes that their dwelling might someday again host amenable residents. Habitat & Society Mortals sharing their home with a lar often create household shrines to them. These tiny sanctuaries, called lararia , serve to house the lar's statuae. Though the lar does not require offerings, mfamilies give them anyway, treating their spirit with reverence. Over time, the lar might become like a member of the family, with the spirit offering advice and taking a keen interest in the raising of children and protection of the home. Once a family has been chosen, a lar does not leave its dwelling, not even to follow the family during extended leaves. The only exception to this is if the family takes the statua with them, though this is not a practice lares encourage. Since the statuae are their anchors to the Material Plane, lares are insecure about exposing them to the outside world where they might be lost, stolen, or damaged. Summoning a Lar A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, mfamilies, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create. Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method. Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal. When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do. Lares in Golarion Lares exhibit extremely variable personalities, and while some prove aloof even after centuries, others become gregarious members of their protected families. Noted here are just two such dichotomous lares rumored to guard sites in Golarion. Uncle Penates: When only the members of the Aphinius family of Taldor are present, their home's lar possesses the expensive painting within their drawing room. From its hidden statua just behind the painting, the boisterous spirit delights in animating the fine oils to make it appear as though the paunchy and opulently dressed Taldan nobleman pictured is personally relaxing and conversing with the family members nearby. None of the family know the nature of the effect, mbelieving the house is haunted by the spirit of their ancestor, but none fear or begrudge the presence of kind old Uncle Penates. Wolz: This lar has long lingered in the burnt-out ruin of an old stone cottage just east of Windsong Abby in Varisia. His wolfshaped statua having fallen beneath a pile of hearth stones, Wolz subtly watches over goodly travelers who come to rest in the tiny ruin, lighting a fire, providing waters, and warding off danger as if they were his long-lost family.",1600
Larabay,11,fey,temperate or warm coastlines or forests,"This pale, blond-haired humanoid possesses bright blue eyes, needlelike teeth, and the large, multicolored wings of a parrot.","Larabays are capricious fey creatures that gravitate toward coastlines regions with warm and temperate islands. They are especially fond of toying with sailors and fishermen, playing pranks aboard ships or in seaside towns by assuming various shapes and using their otherworldly powers of mischief. A larabay's idea of fun can quickly become quite serious, however, when its love of trickery begins to outweigh its sympathy for humanity, and a larabay's well-executed joke may result in a potentially fatal situation for those involved. In their never-ending pursuit of a good laugh, larabays have been known to employ their supernatural illusions to draw ships and their crews into precarious situations such as hazardous waters or hidden shoals, and the depredations of a larabay are often only realized after it's too late. On land, larabays entice their unknowing dupes off cliffs' edges, through monster lairs, or into hidden ravines or pools of quicksand. Larabays use their shapechanging abilities to craft intricate webs of social intrigue, though such schemes are always concocted in an effort simply to conduct a masterful hoax, usually resulting in the devastation or heartbreak of one or more of the parties involved rather than concrete gains on the fey's part. While larabays have been known to inadvertently perform acts of good in the process of gulling cruel-hearted individuals, their unpredictable and precarious natures make them difficult allies, and one can never be sure just how long a larabay will remain faithful to a particular cause before getting bored or whether its companions are simply its latest victims.",12800
Large Acid Quasi-elemental,3,outsider,Quasi-Plane of Acid,"What was once a still puddle of green liquid rises up like a wave, lashing out with acid-dripping tendrils. In the midst of the pool, one can barely make out regions of darker green that form a vaguely human face.","Nestled among the various elemental there lies a plane composed entirely of acid. It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by mto be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elemental-based planes. Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable. They have no trouble moving on land, but prefer the sanctity of their native plane to all others. At rest, an acid quasi-elemental is a clear puddle of liquid with a slightly green hue. It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a waters elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that emits wisps of smoke. Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools when combating foes.

Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental can move underwaters, and although it is an elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when underwaters.

Large Gravity Elemental,5,outsider,Plane of Gravity,"This creature resembles a miniature black hole hovering several feet off the ground. It is a circular region of absolute blackness, with a bizarre distortion around its edges as it warps light waves. Four spiraling, rotating arms of debris and light surround the circular region of darkness. Its facial features are small points of light, almost like stars.","A gravity elemental embodies the very force that controls and holds together the fabric of the universe. The actual elemental is a tiny, superdense ball of matter deep within a zone of darkness and spiraling arms of debris that comprise the body of the elemental. A gravity elemental has mass and size, but no effective weight. Gravity elementals originate on a weird, recently discovered plane that scholars affectionately call the Plane of Gravity. The elemental's home plane is a flat, rocky place with little life, no known waters sources, and no plant life or foliage. The plane is always shrouded in darkness. Dense pockets of intense gravity and areas of little or no gravity dot the barren landscape. Gravity elementals seem to be able to converse with others of their kind by manipulating gravity itself. Gravity elementals attack primarily by flailing at their opponents with multiple arms, each one a mixture of fluctuating fields of micro-gravity and debris that has been sucked into its gravity well. These creatures can also attack by adjusting the local gravity fields around themselves. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",1600

Large Monstrous Sea Wasp,3,vermin,warm waters,"A translucent blue and nearly invisible in waters, this cube-shaped jellyfish has four distinct sides and trails dozens of extremely long tentacles.","Monstrous sea wasps are deadly waters creatures with long, writhing and highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm waters and tend to congregate near coastlines regions or rivers mouths where they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience.

Giant stingrays feed on creatures such as fish, giant crabs, octopus, and sharks. They are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts and often engage prey larger than themselves, relying on their poison to bring down a foe. Female stingrays are usually larger than males. Young stingrays resemble adult rays, but are much smaller in size. During birth, the young's pectoral fins are folded against its body but open as soon as it is born.

Its fleshy gray exterior glistens with slime and its great gray mandibles click wildly.","Helix moths are solitary creatures, though on rare occasions a mated pair might be encountered. The lair of an adult helix moth is almost always above ground and usually takes the form of a cave, tunnel, or other such structure. Such places are always well-hidden and difficult to reach. When the time comes for a female helix moth to lay her eggs, she hollows out a tunnel in the floor of her lair, forms a large chamber at the end of the tunnel and deposits her eggs in the chamber. Helix moth larvae lair in a large, 6-foot-diameter ridged tunnels that burrow down into the earth where they eventually open into a large chamber at least 20 square feet in size. A thick, gray-white slime coats the chamber's floor and walls. Though harmless to living creatures, but generally not pleasant to touch or come in contact with. Occasionally  the secretions of the helix moth larva mix with the slime just enough to form a deadly inhalant poison that affects living creatures within the chamber. Those breathing the fumes must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A new save must be made every minute. Once a successful save is made, that creature cannot be affected by the fumes again for one day. To lay her eggs, the female helix moth uses her acidic secretions and sharpened mandibles to tunnel a hole into the ground and hollow out a large chamber where she lays 2d4 eggs of greenish-gray color. The eggs hatch two weeks after fertilization, producing the helix moth larvae, though typically only about 50% of the larva live past the first day. Helix moths are normally passive creatures except when hunting. During a search for prey, the creature becomes highly aggressive and does not hesitate to attack creature it encounters. A helix moth often journeys up to a mile or more away from its lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried back to its lair and devoured over a period of several days. The adult helix moth attacks by biting or stinging its prey. Its constant droning affects those that combat it, so the helix moth always tries to stay airborne and within range where it can use this ability while staying out of melee range. Helix moth larvae attack by biting. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400

This ability to create mental or empathic bonds is particularly prevalent among female warriors, who form close connections with their saurian mounts. Female lashunta are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds. The males of the race are usually 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. LASHUNTA CHARACTERS  Lashunta are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. They have the following racial traits. +2 Intelligence: Lashunta are almost universally intelligent and eager to learn. Sexual Dimorphism: Male and female lashunta have very different body and personality types, more so than most humanoid species. Male lashunta are muscular  and often brash and unobservant . Female lashunta, though beautiful and commanding , lack the males' rugged builds . Lashunta Magic : A lashunta possessing an Intelligence score of 11 or higher gains the following spell-like abilities: At will- daze, mage hand; 1/day-detect thoughts. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashunta's class levels. Knowledgeable: A lashunta gains a +2 racial bonus to one Knowledge skill. Limited Telepathy : A lashunta is able to mentally communicate with creature within 30 feet with whom she shares a language. Otherwise this ability is identical to the telepathy ability. Languages: Lashunta begin play speaking Lashunta and Elven. Lashunta with high Intelligence scores can choose languages they want .",400
Lava Child,3,monstrous humanoid,volcanic underground,"This squat, clawed humanoid is hunched and pink-skinned, with an oversized head. Its face is that of a fanged and insane human baby, and its mouth opens far wider than it should.","Lava children are ill-tempered creatures created by shaitan genies.

Lava Weird,8,outsider,"Plane of Molten Skies, Elemental Plane of Fire","This serpentine horror coils beneath a haze of shimmering heat waves. As the outer layer of its form cools into hard, black plates, the cracks between these give off the cherry glow of molten rock.","Lava weirds are serpent-like creatures formed of elemental magma. They are rarely encountered outside the Elemental Plane of Fire or the Plane of Molten Skies where they spend their time swimming in pools of liquid fire. Sometimes though, a lava weird slips through a portal into the Material Plane and takes up residency there, always in a pool of lava or magma-whether man-made or naturally occurring. Lava weirds on the Material Plane are bound by their chosen pool and cannot leave it while on the Material Plane. High-level spellcasters sometimes employ lava weirds as guardians. A lava weird appears as a 10-foot long serpent formed of elemental fire. Closer examination reveals liquid rock in scale-like patterns across its body, growing darker across its back. Two small flickers of white fire located on its head serve as eyes. A lava weird prefers to hide in its lava pool until victims come within range. Once a target is close to its lava pool, the weird quickly lashes out and snatches the victim, biting it and coiling around it. It then attempts to pull the victim into its lava pool. Lava weirds are highly aggressive and prone to attack just about creature that wanders too close to their pool.",4800
Lead Skeleton,7,construct,any,This creature appears to be an animated skeleton whose bones have been coated with metal.,"Lead skeletons appear simply to be skeletons coated with metal. Despite their outward appearance, they are actually golem-like constructs and not undead. Therefore, they cannot be turned. Lead skeletons appear as 6-foot tall skeletons constructed of metal. Some have gemstones encrusted in the body and eye sockets. A lead skeleton is expensive to create. Those who choose to create such creatures prefer the added fear and awe the skeletons tend to receive, and have a great deal of additional wealth and time. Lead skeletons can be programmed to attack only certain creatures or be programmed to accept certain passwords or types of clothing. More complex programming tends to fail. While lead skeletons might not have the same abilities as other golems, their immunities and speed make them extraordinarily dangerous. They use their fists to inflict large amounts of damage and attack a single target until it is dead. Construction Bones from a full humanoid skeleton are carefully sheathed in an alloy of lead and iron and rejoined with iron or steel hinges. The total cost of the body must be at least 2,000 gp. An elemental spirit is summoned during the creation and bound to the body. To bind the elemental spirit, the creator must summon and confine an elemental using of the planar binding spells.

In appearance, they have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and wear clothing made of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders, often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks, and most adorn their relatively featureless heads with helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or fruit rinds. This leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a leaf leshy, but not for other creature. Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on their trees, they wheedle companions to engage in mock duels with their twig spears, resorting to private weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they are much more cautious, sticking to cover and harrying their foes with hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly developed sense of self-preservation. GROWING A LEAF LESHY Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or nut trees. To grow a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn and pine cone together, then mounds up leaves, sticks, and needles around them.

Their eyes burn bright with the flames of their faith, flaring brightest when they conjure forth their weapons. Regardless of the armor they choose to wear, their metallic wings merge with and extend beyond the armor, allowing them flight even when wearing the heaviest of protection. Despite their warlike mien, legion archons prefer errands of peace and mercy. Their masters dispatch unarmed legion archons as celestial envoys, though still clad in their heavenly armor.

Lemure,1,outsider,any,A roiling wave of f lesh gushes forward. Amid the fatty surge wriggle half-formed limbs and a dripping tumorous face.,"The least of devilkind, lemures roil forth from the ranks of souls damned to Hell, shapeless masses of quivering flesh. What spark of instinct or memory lingers on within a lemure's semi-consciousness regularly shapes its features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure's features speak nothing of what it once was. Mexhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more than churning pillars of cancerous flesh. Only their knobby, flailing limbs work as they should, and those they merely use to destroy non-infernal life that draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends often appear to be little more than lumps of melted flesh and malformed features. Although among the most loathsome creatures in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell's perverse ecology. When at the end of a mortal life a creature's soul is damned-whether because it revered diabolical forces or failed in the worship of another deity-it joins the masses of suffering souls filling the plains of Avernus, Hell's first layer. Here a soul's torments begin as lesser devils marshesal it along with similar spirits in preparation for a long, perilous journey to one of Hell's deeper layers-typically one suited to the punishments appropriate to the soul's crimes, or merely the domain of a devil who has need for slaves. Upon reaching the realm of their damnation, souls face untold lifetimes of torment at the hands of devils, other fiendish beings, and the deadly machinations of Hell itself. As the formerly mortal essences slowly go mad, they forget their lives, grow bestial, and eventually become little more than automatons of fear and hatred. After ages of such existence, the cruel processes of Hell either utterly annihilate the soul or-in the cases of the most profane spirits-reconsecrate such forsaken beings into lemures, the building blocks of devils, unthinking waves of filth and diabolical flesh. Such repulsive beings assemble in vast mobs, waves of putrescence thousands upon thousands strong. Greater devils can spot the most corrupt of these fiends and, either through mysterious tortures or the powers of Hell itself, reshape them into true devils, newly born and ready to obediently serve in the legions of the damned.",400

They hunt fiends and other evil monsters, silently tailing their prey until they find the right time to leap and slash. Leonals pride themselves on their hunting prowess, and few land creatures can match their speed. Although capable of using weapons, the majority of leonals prefer to battle evil with tooth and claw. Leonals like their battles to be straightforward affairs. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks. They mainly use their magical abilities against large numbers of weaker foes and against those they need to capture or incapacitate without dealing harm to them. Leonals stand 6 feet tall and weigh 270 pounds on average. Males usually have manes of either dark gold or black hair, which may only surround the head or may extend onto the shoulders and chest. Female leonals do not have manes, but may have longer hair on the back of the neck.",19200

Leprechaun,4,fey,temperate forests or hills,This creature resembles a tiny elf with long pointed ears and a pointed nose. It is dressed in brightly colored clothes of red and green and wears a wide-brimmed hat.,"Leprechauns are short fey creatures, about 2 feet tall. They favor brightly colored clothes, particularly greens and reds. Leprechauns are a jovial people, enjoying fine food and drink; some leprechauns also enjoy a good smoke from a long-stemmed pipe. They are a tricky folk and enjoy jokes and pranks, although they usually do not appreciate being the victims of such acts. Most leprechauns are skilled pickpockets, and it is a favored prank of these wee folk to filch items from unsuspecting travelers in their domain and then taunt the intruders into pursuit. The leprechaun so involved in the prank often alternates between being visible and invisible as he teases and pesters his pursuers in a merry chase. Leprechauns tire of pranks quickly, however, and will give up the stolen item and sneak away. Some say leprechauns are descendants of halflings and pixies. Leprechauns summarily dismiss this rumor, however, scoffing at those who repeat it. Leprechauns are fun-loving creatures and prefer to avoid combat. When facing opponents, a leprechaun usually turns invisible and flees. If forced into melee, a leprechaun uses its abilities to their fullest extent, seeking to drive an opponent off rather than kill it.

Lesser Boneneedle,4,vermin,underground,"This creature is about 5 feet in diameter and resembles a bloated yellow bag of pulpy flesh with eight spidery legs. It has two long sharply-curved mandibles protruding from one end of it which you can assume is the front, though the creature seems to be lacking both eyes and a mouth.","Boneneedles are eyeless, bone white creatures that resemble a blob of semi-translucent flesh with eight spindly, spider-like legs. These creatures feed on bone marrow and their lairs are always scattered with leg bones, arm bones, spinal columns and the like from once living creatures; both humanoid and animal. They make their lairs deep underground and avoid natural daylight, though some brave the surface world and venture from their lairs at night. These creatures rarely foray into the outside world, so such encounters are rare, and will always be with more than one boneneedle. Boneneedles tend to congregate in clusters or packs and a typical lair can contain mof these creatures. They have no social structure and simply rely on one another for hunting and feeding. Any young boneneedles present are generally nonthreatening as they lack the deadly mandibles that adults possess. Boneneedles are bloated, yellowish-white blobs of rubbery flesh with spidery legs of black or gold. The mandibles are glossy-black and hollow, and aid the boneneedle in piercing its prey's flesh and bone and siphoning off its meal. When feeding, the boneneedle's fleshy form pulsates and expands. After feeding, its form becomes less translucent and takes on a sickly yellow color. Boneneedles are highly aggressive and opportunistic hunters. Using their coloration, they hide among the piles of bones in their lair and wait for living creatures to wander close by. When prey comes within range, the boneneedle darts from its hiding place and bites. If subjected to natural daylight, boneneedles flee from the source of the light in the most direct route possible. A greater boneneedle is a larger version of the standard boneneedle. It is often found acting as the queen or king within a nest. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200

Fire crabs can be found crawling the shores or swimming in pools and lakes of liquid flame. They are generally non-aggressive creatures and spend their time eating the heated rocks and plants found in the abovementioned planes. Food not eaten is carried and stored in their lair, which takes the form of a large burrow under the fiery waters or on the shores near their ""waters source."" Such burrows are sometimes very large and can contain up to 20 of these creatures. On the Material Plane, fire crabs lair in volcanoes and near hot springs. Fire crabs have large claws and in males, one claw is always larger  than the other. Fire crabs have six segmented and spindly legs, blackish-red in color. Fire crabs are highly territorial and defend their lair with great ferocity. Normally non-aggressive creatures, if their lair is threatened, they fight to the death. Against weaker prey, fire crabs usually just slash with their claws. Stronger foes are grabbed and squeezed by the fire crab. Once they grab an opponent, they hold on, allowing their fires to engulf the foe. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",200
Lesser Gelid Beetle,3,magical beast,cold forests,"A stark white beetle with silvery-black legs the size of wolf, this creature has dull silver mandibles and two sets of dull silvery-black eyes.","Gelid beetles inhabit icy forests and other such desolate places in arctic climates. They spend most of their time hunting, surfacing from their lairs at night to prey on giant or smaller insects. During the daylight hours, gelid beetles like to congregate with others of their kind in warm spots where the sunlight breaks through the trees. Gelid beetles make their lairs in hollowed logs, dead trees, and other such hidden places. During the mating season, the female digs a small underground chamber in a well-secluded place and lays 1d4+1 silverywhite eggs. These eggs hatch in about 2 weeks producing olive-yellow larvae. The larvae spends its time feeding and growing  before passing into the pupa stage after nearly 3 weeks in its larval stage. The pupa sheds its skin for the last time after 8 to 10 days and emerges as an adult gelid beetle. Most beetles are white with silvery-black legs and dull silver mandibles. Some specimens have a mottled silver or black carapace and an even rarer species has dull crimson wing covers. A lesser gelid beetle begins combat with its cold spray. It then charges into combat biting its opponents. Though not intelligent, these creatures often employ hit-and-run tactics, especially when attacking as a group.

Lesser Hollow Serpent,6,undead,underground,"An unseen breeze stirs the desiccated scales of this immense snakeskin, causing the shedding's frayed, dried edges to flutter with a semblance of life. Pinpoints of unholy green light flare behind the intact eye lenses as the head starts to rise. The same glow behind those long-dead eyes illuminates a gaping mouth and bony fangs. Then a terrifying, painful hiss assaults your mind as the serpent slithers forward with a silent, unearthly grace.","Among the mmanifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite. A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds. Ecology As undead creatures, hollow serpents require nothing in the way of sustenance, but their voracious appetite for the life-energy of living creatures is well documented in the annals of Azlanti and serpentfolk lore. The temporary energy derived from their life-draining coils sends most hollow serpents into a feeding frenzy. And their lifesense ability helps them search out even the most well-hidden prey. Much like the predator snakes they mimic, hollow serpents enjoy the hunt and may stalk living creatures for days through the subterranean passageways of the Darklands or the ruined cities of the serpentfolk. Only the high priests of Ydersius know the proper rituals and ceremonies to infuse a shedding with enough divine magic to awaken it into a hollow serpent. However, a hollow serpent also possesses the means to create lesser offspring from its own desiccated flesh. These lesser hollow serpents are much smaller and limited in power, but their undersized nature allows them to venture into passageways a larger hollow serpent could never reach. Serpentfolk priests have also learned how to create these lesser hollow serpents using snakeskin sheddings from normal constrictor snakes, imbuing them with unlife as temple guardians. To spawn a lesser hollow serpent, a hollow serpent must undergo a molting cycle that lasts 3 months. Prior to this hibernation, it must also inf lict no less than nine negative levels on living creatures, storing up the temporary energy from these life-draining attacks to pass onto its new offspring. Thereafter, the hollow serpent sheds a piece of its own skin, which then grows into a lesser hollow serpent. Habitat & Society Hollow serpents have little in the way of society or culture of their own. Beholden to the snake-god, who grants their existence, they exist only to serve and defend the serpentfolk species. Lesser hollow serpents spawned by a hollow serpent intuitively stay near their progenitor- somehow interconnected through the negative energy and siphoned life forces shared between them. Spellcasters who create a lesser hollow serpent on their own may only command its loyalty if capable of commanding undead. Creating a Hollow Serpent While the first hollow serpents were supposedly created from scales shed by beasts favored by the Serpent King himself, and those unholy snakeskins can even shed their own lesser offspring over time, serpentfolk priests can also create their own lesser hollow serpents. A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy waters. Thereafter, a 15thlevel caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents.",2400

Whether souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends swarm from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in great swarms that often number in the thousands. Amid these great hosts flap the swarm leaders, the magaav, fierce mockeries of the angelic form capable of directing and redirecting massive columns of their brethren like the brain of a single colossal infernal beast.

Lesser Shadow,0.5,undead,any,This creature appears to be a humanoid constructed of living darkness.,"According to ancient texts, an arcane creature known only as the Shadow Lord created beings of living darkness to aid him and protect him.

These creatures became known as lesser shadows. Though not as powerful as their stronger relatives, lesser shadows are every bit as evil. A lesser shadow is completely indistinguishable from a standard shadow. Like its brethren, it is a creature of living darkness. Lesser shadows hide in darkness, springing to attack when living opponents wander too close. They are often led in combat by a shadow. Unlike normal shadows, lesser shadows do not create spawn .

Leucrotta,5,magical beast,temperate or tropical forests or hills,"This freakish beast has the head of a badger, the hooves of a stag, and a wide mouth with sharp ridges of bone instead of teeth.","Reputed to be descended from hyenas and a demon lord, these creatures are intelligent and cruel, using their astounding vocal mimicry to lure foolish and unsuspecting creatures to where the pack can torment them at its leisure before finally devouring them. Five feet tall at the shoulder, its tawny fur often coated with dried and clotted filth, the leucrotta is a powerful beast weighing over 800 pounds. The sharp bone ridges that line its oversized jaws instead of teeth are incredibly durable and, combined with massive jaw muscles, allow its bite to shear through bone and even steel. Leucrottas consume their prey gear and all; they vomit up what they cannot digest and pick through the debris in search of valuable items that might help them lure in prey. Leucrottas sometimes lead packs of gnolls, or even of their bestial cousins the crocottas . They refuse to let themselves be used as beasts of burden, but sometimes allow favored gnoll companions to ride them into battle as steeds. The leucrotta in a gnoll pack generally thinks of itself as the leader of that group, and treats established gnoll chieftain poorly in an attempt to goad that gnoll into attacking it. Those leucrottas that succeed in slaying a gnoll leader typically find it much easier to assume the role of tribal leader. Crocotta These degenerate offshoots of leucrottas have animallevel intelligence, but sense a kinship with leucrottas and obey them instinctively. Treat a crocotta as an advanced dire hyena with Improved Critical  as a bonus feat. A crocotta looks similar to a leucrotta, save that it has shorter back legs, giving it a hunched, more hyena-like appearance. Leucrottas view crocottas with disdain and even shame, but it's not unusual to find these large hyena-like beasts in close proximity to a leucrotta pack.

Lhaksharut,20,outsider,any,This six-armed creature appears to be made of stone. Its lower torso is a collection of whirring rings of metal.,"A typical lhaksharut is a six-armed construct that appears to be made of a mix of metals and stone. Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes. Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another.

Lich,12,undead,any,Once fine robes hang in tatters from this withered corpse's frame. A pale blue light shines from where its eyes should be.,"Few creatures are more feared than the lich. The pinnacle of necromantic art, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to shed his life as a method to cheat death by becoming undead. While mwho reach such heights of power stop at nothing to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a lich is abhorrent to most creatures. The process involves the extraction of the spellcaster's life-force and its imprisonment in a specially prepared phylactery-the spellcaster gives up life, but in trapping life he also traps his death, and as long as his phylactery remains intact he can continue on in his research and work without fear of the passage of time. The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While construction of the magical phylactery to contain the spellcaster's soul is a critical component, a prospective lich must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls are exactly alike-a ritual that works for one spellcaster might simply kill another or drive him insane. The exact methods for each spellcaster's transformation are left to the GM's discretion, but should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades. The Lich's Phylactery An integral part of becoming a lich is the creation of the phylactery in which the character stores his soul. The only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich can rejuvenate after it is killed . Each lich must create its own phylactery by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items. Creating a Lich ""Lich"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature , provided it can create the required phylactery. A lich retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity . The lich also gains the following defensive ability. Rejuvenation : When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery  immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed , usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it. Melee Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons uses its natural weapons  in addition to its touch attack . A lich armed with a weapon uses its weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural weapon. Damage: A lich's touch attack uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures + 1 point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. As negative energy, this damage can be used to heal undead creatures. A lich can take a full-round action to infuse itself with this energy, healing damage as if it had used its touch attack against itself. Special Attacks: A lich gains the two special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Fear Aura : Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Paralyzing Touch : Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or spell that can remove a curse can free the victim . The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. Abilities: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score. Skills: Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge , Knowledge , Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.",12800
Lich Shade,9,undead,any,This creature appears as a rotting and skeletal humanoid dressed in tattered and worn robes with ancient runes etched on their surface. Its eyes blaze with a crimson fire.,"The road a spellcaster travels in his or her quest for lichdom is not without danger. During the dark rituals invoked to achieve lichdom, the caster sometimes errs in his or her calculations or unleashes mystic forces best left untapped. When such an event occurs, the spellcaster is usually destroyed outright. Other times, something is born as a result of this failed ritual-a lich shade. Lich shades are evil creatures who attempted to achieve lichdom but failed for whatever reason. The creature is not destroyed, nor does it become a lich, it becomes something in between-something in between mortal life and eternal unlife. Lich shades retain portions of their life's memories, and always retain full memory of the dark ritual they attempted while trying to become a lich. For this reason alone, they have grown to hate the living and particularly living spellcasters whom they blame  for their current condition. A lich shade always attacks opponents who have a spellcaster in their midst, often targeting that individual directly above all others. A lich shade stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds. The robes and gowns it wears often denote its previous life's profession . A lich shade attacks with its powerful claws, rending and tearing at its foes. If facing a spellcaster and it leeches one of its spells, it usually releases the first spell leeched as an eldritch bolt against its closest foe. Further leeched spells are used to heal the lich shade or cast back against its foes. If faced with certain defeat, a lich shade wills its own destruction, invoking its death throes ability, hoping to take several of its opponents with it. A lich shade's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",6400
Lightning Mephit,3,outsider,any,This small creature appears to be a humanoid-shaped being composed of electricity. Bluish-white lighting arcs in small bursts from its body.,"Lightning mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Air and Quasi- Elemental Plane of Lighting. Rarely are they encountered elsewhere unless summoned or called by a spellcaster. If encountered on a material plane it is usually in the employ of some spellcaster who has called it to do his or her bidding. Occasionally however, a lightning mephit stumbles into a material plane by way of a lightning storm . Lightning mephits found anywhere except their home plane will be encountered in areas where lightning and storms are most prevalent. A lightning mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound. A lightning mephit begins combat with a lightning bolt attack, targeting the opponent closest to it. On the following round it breathes a cone of lightning on its foes if most are within range; otherwise it moves to melee combat. Once in melee, a lightning mephit uses its natural attacks and shocking grasp, as well as its breath weapon . A lightning mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Lightning Treant,8,plant,temperate forests,"This creature looks like an animated, yet dead, moss-covered tree. Its bark is darkened with age and no leaves appear on its branches.","Unlike most treants, this creature appears to be a moss-covered dead tree, with bare branches stretched toward the skies. Often living in the shade of larger trees, or in the wasteland of a destroyed forests, lightning treants are strange, angry creatures whose powers and talents are almost elemental in nature. Confused by some travelers with shambling mounds, these creatures are much larger and the moss-like vegetation they are covered with is only a thin layer over their hard wooden core. While mtypes of treants might make an effort to negotiate, or at least try to determine whether or not travelers might be hostile to whatever forests they are living in, lightning treants tend to simply attack first and, quite frankly, not question anything. Using their ability to call lightning storms, these creatures can be a true bane to travelers, especially those that do not recognize them at first. Lightning treants have an inherent hatred of all humanoids and attack them on sight. If there are more than one or two in a group the lightning treant starts combat with a chain lightning spell and then uses call lightning storm to have further lightning bolts ready; afterward, the lightning treant charges into combat, focusing first on anyone with an axe or other slashing weapon. If combat goes against it, it uses lightning bolt on its enemies, as well as using bolts called down with call lightning storm to heal itself or hurt its opponents.

Lightning Weird,8,outsider,Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning,The snakelike creature crackles and thrashes like a bolt of lightning. It flares with electrical brilliance as tiny arcs travel up and down its form.,"The Quasi-Plane of Lightning is not only home to the lightning quasielementals , but also is home to the serpent-like lightning weirds. The plane itself is an inhospitable place to those without some protection against electricity. Lightning weirds spend their time riding electrical storms on their native plane. Casters often summon lightning weirds to do their bidding; confining them into pools of lightning until their task is complete. These creatures sometimes find their way through a portal into the Material Plane and will be found in areas of concentrated lightning strikes. Lightning weirds resemble 10-foot long serpents composed of yellow or white crackling lightning. Their body is long and thin and is always in motion. Brilliant flares of electricity function as the creature's eyes and small bolts of electricity constantly leap and dance from its form. Lightning weirds lash out of their crackling pools as soon as an opponent moves too close. Foes are usually grabbed and pulled into the pool where the weird holds on and waits for the creature to die. The lightning weird always chooses a heavily-armored or metal-armored foe over an opponent in light or no armor. These creatures hate lightning quasi-elementals and attack them on sight.

Lilin Devil,6,outsider,any,"A beautiful well-proportioned woman with crimson skin stands before you. Her eyes are dark, almost black as is her hair. A pair of small bat-like wings protrudes from her shoulders. She wields a gleaming longsword in her hand.","Lilins are thought to be the descendants of Lilith, the former Queen of Hell . Before her coming, lilins were unknown in the Hells. Rumors spoken in hushed whispers say lilins are the offspring of Lilith and an incubus . For this, lilins are often viewed with contempt and hatred among devilkind. Among the devilish ranks, lilins serve as spies and information gatherers. Though they possess decent combat skills, they generally do not serve in the hellish armies in other role. Man arch-devil, ignoring the foolish rumors that lilins are indeed some demon-devil crossbreed, has employed the services of a lilin on more than one occasion. Even now, march-devils keep a small retinue of these devilish mistresses stashed in a rival's palace gathering as much information as they can on each other. A lilin appears as a crimson-skinned woman about 5-1/2 feet tall with long dark hair. Her eyes are deep black with flecks of blue. Her wings are black and leathery and her arms end in clawed hands. Lilins dress in light colored flowing gowns and robes and carry their longswords slung at their hips. A lilin always enters combat with her protection from good in effect and begins by attempting to charm the closest foe. A weak-minded foe that comes within range is subjected to a suggestion. Afterwards she usually attacks with her longsword. If combat goes poorly for a lilin she attempts to flee but not before summoning a host of devils to cover her escape.

Lilith,16,outsider,any,"A curvaceous and beautiful woman with cinnamon-brown skin, dark red hair, and shining emerald eyes stands before you. She is scantily clad in scarlet robes and carries a longsword at her side.","Lilith was once consort to Moloch, ruler of the 6th plane of Hell. When the Great Uprising that pitted Lucifer and his minions against Asmodeus and his minions occurred, Lilith sided with Lucifer. When Moloch heard of her betrayal he raged against her, nearly killing her. If not for the swift action of several of her lilins , she would have surely been killed. During the commotion and chaos, she was spirited away to a safe location by Xaphan. When Lucifer constructed the plane of Infernus, Lilith had found her new home. She became a member of Lucifer's court and serves as one of his concubines and chief officers . Lucifer, as of late has taken a special interest in her and rumors abound that should he take a queen to rule beside him it will be Lilith. This has infuriated more than one of his consorts, especially Demoriel who jealously wants the throne of Infernus and Lucifer all to herself. Lilith knows of Demoriel's jealousy and always keeps an open eye on her . Lilith appears as an insanely comely female standing 5'7"" tall and weighing roughly 130 pounds. Her skin is cinnamon colored and her hair, waist length and blood red. Her eyes are emerald green and sparkle under the fiery skies of Infernus. Her hands end in claws and underneath her thick hair she hides two tiny dark black horns. She has a small pair of leathery black bat-like wings that she can fold against her back and hide under her robes at a moment's notice should the need for such deception arise. ""…and thus, Lucifer created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, Malefacta, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again."" - translated from the ‘Infernal Grimoire: The Politics of Hell' Lilith begins combat by peppering her foes with her spell-like abilities.

Lillend Azata,7,outsider,any,"This creature has the body of a seductive, winged elven woman from the waist up and that of a snake from the waist down.","Among the azatas, lillends are the tale-tellers and chroniclers, gathering lore and recording stories in the form of epic poems and songs. They are generally peaceful, though they are swift to act if they believe a piece of rare art or a talented artist is threatened. A lillend's lower section is about 20 feet long, and a typical lillend weighs 3,800 pounds. Although they have no need of mortal nourishment, it is said that lillends sup on the joy of music, art, and performance. They also love unspoiled wilderness and seek out places in the mortal realm that remind them of the beauty of their home plane. From the lore of numerous races come tales of these muses, particularly those that have taken a vested interest in the training of a single talented prodigy or the ongoing creation of some fantastic work of art. Such legends sometimes prove true, as all lillends have their favorite works, creations, and artists, and often visit the Material Plane to enjoy their splendor and make sure they remain safe. In the defense of such beauty, lillends prove passionate foes, calling upon the might of nearby allies or crushing philistines in their striking but deadly coils.",3200

Females are slightly smaller but use the same statistics. Lions are usually the top animal predators in their territories, though they resort to scavenging if convenient or necessary. They may kill other predators  that encroach upon their haunts, but rarely eat these kills unless game is scarce. Most lions do not selectively hunt humanoids, but occasionally one learns what easy kills they are and becomes a man-eater. Lions prefer plains but can adapt to living in shallow caves as long as there's a large and stable supply of prey to keep them fed.",800
Livestone,6,ooze,any,A large slab of moss-covered rock seems to ooze and move before you.,"Livestone is a strange species of ooze that can solidify itself into a consistency that very closely resembles that of stone. In its solidified form, a livestone is indistinguishable from a normal boulder or slab of rock. No one is quite sure from where livestones originated, but ancient legends say that the dwarves accidentally unleashed these horrors on the surface world by digging into their subterranean lairs. Eventually, some livestones found their way to the surface. Livestones are incredibly longlived, solidifying and entering a form of hibernation and remaining that way indefinitely until a food source wanders too near. Livestones have a simple chameleon-like ability to mimic local stone by ingesting a small sample and adjusting its own color and texture to match. A hibernating livestone can become covered in moss and lichens to further the deception. Livestones generally attack from ambush, waiting for a potential meal to pass before flowing into their ooze form and rushing up to engulf the prey. If the surprise attack fails, a livestone resorts to hammering with a pseudopod. When attacking in this manner, a livestone will solidify the tip of the pseudopod and strike with a hammer-like blow. A livestone's usual tactic is to solidify the half of its body facing the prey and then send hard-tipped pseudopods out from behind this shield . Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",2400
Living lakes,22,Ooze,land,"The lakes's surface is calm and serene, and a cool morning mist rises from it. Suddenly, it is alive with activity as a massive pseudopod, towering dozens of feet into the air, erupts like a cyclone.","Hundreds of feet across, a living lakes, also called an agrath-ogh in the language of the orcs, is an ooze of truly colossal proportions. The first living lakes is said to have fallen from the heavens ages ago at a time so ancient that no eyes were around to witness its fall. The protoplasmic body of a living lakes is fluid in nature and transparent in waters, such that one of these creatures could remain unseen and unknown for centuries. Unlike most oozes, a living lakes is a not a mindless blob of muck. It is intelligent, but it is also highly receptive to the thoughts and beliefs of large group of intelligent creatures that live near it. A living lakes can become a god-so to speak-because of the will of the creatures that worship it. Thus, it responds in a manner dictated by its own worshipers. The god is created by the worshiper, instead of vice-versa. Unfortunately for the world, living lakes are generally found in hills and badlands- the very same environs favored by orcs. Living lakes worshiped by orcs are cruel, chaotic, destructive things, since those are the qualities most revered in orcish deities. Once it has been ensconced as a god, a living lakes uses its abilities to live up to the expectations of its worshipers. It can reward a tasty sacrifice with a life-giving rain, or punish insolence with a plague of insects. A living lakes attacks by forming pseudopods from its oozy form and pummeling its opponents. A grabbed foe is constricted or engulfed in the creature's body, usually only released when it dies or falls unconscious. Against powerful opponents, or those that press the combat, the living lakes mixes its spells with its natural attacks, usually summoning animals or animating plants to help it. A living lakes usually forms at least one pseudopod per opponent it faces. It can form a maximum of one pseudopod per 3 Hit Dice it possesses. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",615000
Living Topiary,4,plant,land,"Shuff ling forward on brambly limbs, this walking green hedge has the rough shape of a griffin and appears to move on its own.","Although often thought to come from purely fictitious imaginings, the inspiration for classical topiaries comes from a very real-life source: animal-shaped shrubs. Part plant, part beast, living topiaries are moving flora that look like decorative lawn ornaments used to fancy up gardens and groves, though their bestial nature and aloof demeanor prove they are far from mere decorations. Living topiaries range in height from shrubs only a couple feet off the ground to towering hedges. The average specimen is about 4 feet tall and 6 feet in length, and weighs 200 pounds. Ecology Living topiaries hail from distant forests and longforgotten fields, remnants of gargantuan plants that once walked the earth. Some theorize that the things originally came from the First World, where odd phenomena such as animal-shaped flora are not unheard of. Living topiaries wander the lands with singular purpose: to search for more plants to consume and turn into their own kind. Living topiaries can be composed of virtually variety of shrubbery. As they travel, these transforming hedges pick up loose plant life, which then becomes part of the living topiary itself. When an individual topiary has collected enough supplementary undergrowth that is has doubled in size, it can divide itself in two. This method of asexual reproduction is quite rapid and efficient, and would result in a booming population of living topiaries if the plants were not so fragile. Ironically, some of the topiaries' most deadly predators are also typically the tamest. Herbivorous creatures such as caribou and berry-eating birds frequently nip at the hulking masses of brush when they are at rest, often in such small increments that the topiary hardly notices. These natural predators sometimes make it difficult for living topiaries to grow and reproduce, keeping their size in constant flux. Natural hazards such as drought and fire also present constant danger to topiaries, as frequent movement expends much of their energy and stored waters supply. Entire fleets of the wandering flora have reproduced in exponential numbers only to be consumed by the rapid spread of a brush fire. Though somewhat delicate, topiaries often live for several decades, as their bodies are constantly refreshed with new plant matter. Almost always on the move, however, a topiary sometimes accidentally finds itself in an area void of adequate additional shrubbery or waters, such as a vast plain or deserts. In such situations, an individual deprived of nutrients can quickly dry out and shrivel over the course of several days. Living topiaries subsist purely on photosynthetic energy and waters and thus seek out areas with abundant amounts of both. However, even stronger than this survival drive is their innate compulsion to find different types of plants in order to turn themselves into more diverse topiaries. The desire for diverse genes is enough to scatter living topiaries across entire nations, causing their appearances to be sporadic and unpredictable. Habitat & Society Nomadic by nature, living topiaries wander from forests to forests in continual search of ever more diverse plants to collect and assimilate. Driven by this instinct to absorb different types of undergrowth and brush, living topiaries see the benefit in spreading themselves thin rather than collaborating in huge numbers. On their own, living topiaries are primarily solitary creatures, though upon dividing into a new pair, topiaries may travel together, their subconscious goals as similar as the topiaries' twinned appearances. In this way, it may come to be that a fair number of the plant drifters journey alongside each other, creating a sort of herd. It's at this point that living topiaries tend to branch off from one another, knowing that while there is strength in numbers, traveling in such herds does not allow for the maximum amount of diversity while collecting other plants. Creating Living Topiaries While druidic lore tells of naturally occurring topiary creatures springing full-grown and alive from the depths of wild forests, places infused by strange magic, or portals to fey realms, these creatures can also be created in a fashion similar to most constructs. Rather than being cultivated by wizards and other arcane spellcasters, though, they are most often created by druids and servants of nature deities who summon spirits of the natural world to infuse their lovingly sculpted topiary shapes with life. Aside from requiring the creator to craft a topiary in a suitably lifelike shape, a variety of exotic herbs, salves, fertilizers, and rare earths are required to bring the plant to life, making the process a costly endeavor.

Lizardfolk,1,humanoid,temperate swamps,"This reptilian humanoid has green scales, a short and toothy snout, and a thick alligator-like tail.","Lizardfolk are proud and powerful reptilian predators that make their communal homes in scattered villages deep within swamps and marshes. Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by mother races as backwaters savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright. Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the waters, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires. Though generally neutral, lizardfolks' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization's ""gifts,"" and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don't defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamps, and nothing should go to waste. The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampsy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet.",400
Locathah,0.5,humanoid,temperate or warm waters,"This lean humanoid bears crested fins on its head and back, and has the wide-eyed and wide-lipped face of a fish.","Simple waters creatures shunned by landwalkers and undersea folk alike, locathahs live in tight-knit communities scattered throughout the world's seas, lakes. and watersways. Locathahs possess scaly ochre skin tinged with green and yellow. Ridged, rust-colored skin covers their chests and stomachs, and a mottled wash of green, brown, and orange colors their fins like aging kelp. Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above waters that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most landdwellers. Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy. These creatures dislike combat and flee when disarmed or outnumbered. Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts. Locathah matriarchs serve their undersea tribes not only as chieftains, but also as the primary egg layers of the community. Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own. Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful waters races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers. Locathah stand roughly as tall as humans, yet their fins jut out, giving them an imposing stature. Lean and strong, locathahs weigh roughly 160 pounds.",200
Longboat Captain,4,humanoid,any,"This proud Ulfen captain stands alert on the deck of her dragon-prowed longship, bow at the ready.","A longship captain typically leads a crew of Ulfen raiders, and as such must be as adept at combat as she is at command and tactics. At sea or on land, her steely gaze and authoritative tone ensure that her crew follow her orders quickly and without argument. An accomplished sailor herself, she has the ability to motivate her crew to work in unison and give their best effort-and indeed, to fight and die as necessary. She knows the workings of her ship inside out, often having had a hand in its construction. If the ship needs repairs in the midst of a journey, she proves herself a skilled carpenter and sail maker. If a longship is caught in one of ferocious storms that frequently lash the Steaming Sea, the captain's determination and shouted commands urging all hands to row for their lives are often the only things that prevent the ship from capsizing. Mlongship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification. In a naval battle, a longboat captain directs both the ship's course and her crew's tactics, all while personally raining down a shower of deadly arrows on the enemy vessel. Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can d e t e r m i n e whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death. When engaged in coastlines raiding, the captain supervises the planning of the attack. She often leads a reserve group of raiders to strike against the strongest points of resistance or cut off those trying to flee. Those assigned to the captain's guard see the post as a mark of honor, as well as a chance for a greater share of the loot. A powerful and prosperous captain is often known to have her vessel's figurehead enchanted with the ability to spit out gouts of flame, or so that its eyes glow with an eerie light, casting fear into the hearts of enemies who see it bearing down on them.",1200
Lorelei,12,aberration,coastlines,What appears to be a rock sprouts tentacles from its uppermost surface. The human face spanning much of the creature's barrel-shaped body gives the creature a passing resemblance to a disembodied neck and head with tentacles for hair.,"A lorelei resembles an enormous, stony sea anemone with a humanlike face covering much of its body. Noted for its ability to produce magical murmurs that entrance sailors navigating close to its lair, a lorelei is a magnet for destruction. The creatures lurk near rocky outcroppings and protuberances, barely concealed by crashing waves or rushing rivers, eager to lure humanoids to their deaths. Also known as a ""murmuring stone"" for its rocklike natural camouf lage, a lorelei is a solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and oceans trenches, emerging only to torment the living. When not pursuing more complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond of wrecking ships on nearby rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown. Some claim these creature were once a species of beautiful fey cursed by foul forces. This claim is backed by the fact that they behave much like nereids, nixies, and sirens. A lorelei stands 9 feet tall, not counting the tentacles atop its body, and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Ecology A lorelei's body is barrel-shaped, with a foot known as a basal disk at the bottom. A lorelei's basal disk is less adhesive than that of a sea anemone but more flexible, allowing the lorelei to climb at a reasonable pace, and to swim by undulating its underside. At the top end of the lorelei's body, dozens of tentacles surround a toothless maw that it uses to ingest food. In addition to these strange features, the lorelei has a humanlike face that covers much of its body on one side. The mouth on the lorelei's face cannot consume food-it exists only to produce speech and other sounds. In contrast, a lorelei's eyes are fully functional. The lorelei has no ears, but can sense sound with its entire body, having a range of hearing comparable to that of an average human. A lorelei's brain is located behind its face, protected by a plate of cartilage. That hard plate is the only part of a lorelei's body that isn't yielding and rubbery. A lorelei's hide is difficult to crush and cut, serving as surprisingly effective natural armor. This skin is also camouf laged with a rocklike appearance. A lorelei can retract its tentacles to take on the appearance of a boulder, allowing it to remain hidden until its prey is too close to escape. True to their rarity and solitary nature, loreleis reproduce asexually. Every few decades, a lorelei can produce another of its kind by splitting off a single piece of its body, which then grows into a young lorelei. Offspring produced in this manner inherit portions of their parent's memories, giving them fully functioning adult minds without need for instruction or socialization. Habitat & Society A lorelei prefers a lonesome and solitary existence, shunning its own kind as readily as it shuns all living things. Brooding and morose, loreleis enjoy only one thing: making other, happier creatures suffer. Loreleis regularly orchestrate conf licts, shipwrecks, and other disasters to celebrate the cruel hand of fate that rules the nihilistic world they see everywhere they look. Since it rarely wanders far from its rocky lair, a lorelei sits in wait, sometimes for weeks, hoping for a victim to come within range of its murmured song. Though it will fight to keep its lair, a lorelei dislikes prolonged conf lict and abandons its rocky outcroppings or underwaters caves if the location receives too much visitation or attention. Sometimes a lorelei maintains two or three lairs in order to move between them regularly, thus attracting less attention to each location.",19200
Lorthact,25,outsider,any,This devilish humanoid has five horns growing out of his forehead that resemble a crown. He stands on stout cloven hooves.,"Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies desertsed him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels. After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers, Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly comfortable under the gaze of so mpotentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200 years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal favor in Hell. In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos. Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his identity or unravel his schemes.",1638400
Lucifer,39,outsider,any,"This exquisitely handsome humanoid stands at least 10 feet tall . His hair is long and jet black as is his neatly-trimmed and forked beard. His hands end in wicked claws and his feet are cloven. A long snake-like, stinger-tipped tail dances behind him and intertwines itself around the massive triple-pronged pitchfork he carries. Two oversized and backward-curving blackened horns jut from his head. He is cloaked in a suit of banded armor that glistens with the color of the night skies.","Lucifer has mnames: The Prince of Lies, The Prince of Darkness, The Adversary, The Prince of Light, and Satan. It is believed that Lucifer was the first devil in existence, having been cast down from the heavens when he challenged the rulings of the gods of law and good. After being cast down, Lucifer constructed a plane he called Hell. There he built his palace of iron and basalt on the lowest and darkest region of Hell. He divided this realm into nine distinct regions and appointed his closest allies to rule. Each lord was allowed to mold and shape his domain as he saw fit, but all paid homage to Lucifer. A millennia passed and Lucifer reigned supreme in Hell. During this time, one of the lieutenants  decided he could do a much better job of running Hell than Lucifer could. Asmodeus coveted the Throne of Hell and wanted it for himself. Using his powers of persuasion, he promised each and every other arch-devil that stood with him and challenged Lucifer a larger role in the ""new"" Hells. Those that stood against him, he said, would be destroyed or cast out of Hell along with Lucifer when the end came. This time in Hell's history became known as the Great Uprising. Asmodeus managed to sway every single arch-devil, save one. Belial refused to stand with Asmodeus and barely escaped capture at the hands of the other arch-devils. When the battle for Hell's Throne commenced, Belial, Lucifer, and their allies stood fast against the mighty armies of the other arch-devils. In the end however, the sheer numbers of devils that fought against Lucifer overwhelmed his armies and those that stood with him. Lucifer and his allies were forced to flee Hell or face destruction. The sole exception was Belial. Near the end of the war when he saw that Lucifer would likely lose the Throne, Belial turned and joined Asmodeus' ranks and helped oust Lucifer from Hell. Cast out, Lucifer wanted vengeance. But vengeance required power, and he was tired, injured, and weakened from the time spent battling in Hell. He needed a place to rest, a place to grow in power, and a place to plan. Thus he created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood, and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, Malefacta, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again. Lucifer is said to be one with the plane. As the gods of law are to the planes of good, so is Lucifer to Infernus. Nothing goes unnoticed by him on Infernus. All movements are seen, all whispers are heard. A plan is not hatched or contrived without Lucifer's knowledge. When people speak of Infernus, they speak of Lucifer and vice versa. No creature, it is thought, stands a chance against Lucifer on Infernus, not even the arch-devils that stood against him during the Great Uprising. But Lucifer knows that when the battle comes, he will have to fight the arch-devils on their own planes, not on Infernus, and he is preparing for just that. By sending his agents to the Material Plane to corrupt good-aligned beings and convert those currently paying homage to Hell's rulers, Lucifer grows in strength. And this strength gives him power, power that surpasses he ever had- including his near deific powers he possessed in the planes of good. And when his power finally reaches its pinnacle, he will travel to Hell and destroy it and every single inhabitant. Lucifer stands 10 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Lucifer rarely engages in combat , preferring to summon pit fiends to fight his would-be challengers. If he does enter combat, he fights with his Rod, spells, spell-like abilities, gaze attacks, poison, and acid. Slain foes are either left in the ""care"" of his minions or taken to Xaphan and used to stoke the hellish furnaces that power Malefacta. Servants of Lucifer Followers of Lucifer are far and wide and consist of evil humanoids; usually clerics, necromancers, sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Lucifer are called Dark Cardinals and must sign a pact of evil with Lucifer. Dark Cardinals can receive spells from Lucifer and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and War. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",6560000
Lukwata,11,magical beast,"warm rivers, lakes, or swamps","A long, spiny fin runs down the length of the dolphinlike body of this eel-headed predator.","Lukwatas slip through dark tropical waters, preying upon all who dare enter their deep junglesrivers and pools, including beasts typically considered apex predators. While scholars say the beasts favor the dark, light doesn't deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long, flat bodies are reminiscent of those of dolphins or large fish, but lukwatas' heads are distinctively eel-like. A lukwata's unusual ability to disrupt magical effects rises from the strange crystalline growths that line its throat and stomach-crystals that allow the lukwata to gain nutrients from magical items as efficiently as from flesh and blood. These same growths give the lukwata an unusually strong resistance to all manner of magic attacks. Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals, and attack them on sight, even if the lukwata has recently fed. Most crocodilians are not large enough to pose a significant threat; however, some accounts exist of lukwatas and dire crocodiles crossing paths. These fights are renowned for inf licting great destruction, with the embattled creatures smashing to bits piers, flotillas, and even dams in their fury.

A few lunar nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail, and weighs close to 200 pounds. Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined towers or atop mountains-place open to the skies at night. There they peer through astrological devices, closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to decipher more of the universe. Those living underground make nightly trips to the open skies when they can. Cloudy nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings. Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of skies-watchers. These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome of calculations of the stars and planets moving through the inky black of the night skies. In small doses tempered with waters, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take the substance as a ritualistic drug.",2400

These creatures are extremely territorial and are never encountered with others of their kind. Mating habits among lurkers is unknown to sages as no two of these creatures have ever been encountered together. A typical lurker above has a hunting territory of several square miles. A lurker above waits for its prey, clinging to the ceiling, roof, or other such overhang. When prey passes beneath it, the lurker above drops from its hiding place and wraps itself around its prey. Lurker Below The lurker below is an waters variety of lurker above that makes its lair in body of waters and in climate .

Gnomes in particular seem to incur these unexplained attacks, leading some to believe that lurkers may be agents of ancient and vengeful forces. Creatures of the light, lurkers are visible only in dim illumination, with anything brighter than a flickering torch making them completely invisible, even as they savage their enemies-a prospect terrifying to those civilized races that equate light with safety. A lurker in light turns conventional wisdom on its head, for they detest darkness and the creatures that dwell in it, yet they themselves are sadistic and evil. They particularly hate darkmantles, dwarves, and creatures from the Plane of Shadow, and given the time, they enjoy torturing such creatures to death if they can capture them alive. If killed, a lurker in light disintegrates over the course of several minutes into 2d6 pounds of dust that radiates faint evocation magic and glows for 1d6 days with a cold light equal to that provided by a candle. This dust damages shadows as if it were holy waters, with a pound of dust equal to one flask of holy waters. A lurker in light is 3 feet tall, but weighs only 20 pounds.",1600

Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about waters creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to steer clear of a hungry lusca.

Lynx,2,animal,"cold forests, hills, mountains or plains",This long-haired cat has tufts of black hair growing form the tips of its ears.,"The lynx is a member of the great cat family and makes its home in the colder regions of the world, most often in rocky areas above the tree line. Lynxes are generally solitary creatures and are excellent climbers. The lynx, like other big cats, is territorial and a solitary hunter. Most of its hunting is done during the daylight hours, though some species of lynx hunts only at night. Its diet generally consists of small animals such as rodents, birds, fish, and rabbits. During the winter months its diet includes larger prey such as elk or deer. Prey that is killed is partially eaten and the remaining carcass is buried in thick underbrush or snow. The lynx returns over a period of 1d6 days to finish its meal. Lynxes are generally solitary creatures, but occasionally a den is discovered that contains a male, female and 1d6 cubs. Cubs are generally ineffective and non-threatening in combat. Cubs are sometimes captured and sold on the market where they can be trained and raised. A lynx has thick, gray fur that is spotted, striped, or plain. During the winter months through the summer months, its coat varies from spotted to plain. Its short tail is ringed and tipped with black fur. Its pointed ears are tipped with tufts of long black hairs and its eyes range from green to gray to brown. Its paws are large and covered with thick fur. This helps the lynx distribute its weight when moving across snowy terrain. The average lynx is 2 1/2 feet to 4 feet long and weighs 20-40 pounds. Lynxes stalk their prey and prefer to strike from ambush. They primarily use their bite attack in combat, only relying on their claws if they must. A lynx goes for the ""kill shot"" at first opportunity against its quarry, attempting to sink its teeth into its opponent's throat. Caracal The caracal is a small cat, very similar to the lynx, and is commonly referred to as the deserts lynx . The caracal uses the statistics for the lynx, but is found in warm or temperate plains and hills and does not have the snow move ability of the standard lynx.

Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic. Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often called ""glistenwings"" by gnomes and half lings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey-while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium.

Its features are human-like though emotionless.,"Lythics are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. There, they spend their time in huge underground caverns with others of their race or in the compof earth elementals. Some lythics serve the elder elemental lords as spies, using their skills of going unnoticed to sneak into the palaces of arch-rivals. Lythics occasionally punch through a vortex or portal and wind up on the Material Plane. Other outer planes  hold no interest for the lythic. On the Material Plane, they spend their time underground or gliding through mountains, devouring minerals as they move along. Occasionally, a lythic's elemental master sends it on a mission into the Material Plane. Lythics are not particularly fond of pechs and generally avoid them or attack on sight. They rarely associate with other elemental creatures. Lythic are not particularly hostile unless threatened. When a party of would-be delvers enters its domain, the lythic often trails them by blending with surrounding stone. If detected, a lythic usually flees unless attacked. Once in combat however, a lythic rarely backs down, and often fights until it is killed or its opponents are dead or fleeing. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Maftet,6,monstrous humanoid,temperate or warm deserts or mountains,"Broad hawk wings support this creature with the torso of a bronze-skinned human and the lower body of a tawny, bipedal lion.","Dwelling in crumbling ruins and lost cities, maftets are a race of winged feline humanoids. Accomplished hunters and stalkers, maftets are highly skilled in fighting with dual scimitars. A typical maftet is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds. The fur on their leonine bodies ranges in coloration from a light buff to goldenrod or rust red. In some climates, maftets have the spotted lower bodies of leopards, and in rare circumstances they may possess white fur and pale skin or black fur and grayish-purple skin. Such individuals frequently rise to positions of power among their kind. At home in dry deserts and mountains, maftets prefer to lair in abandoned ruins, mysteriously drawn to such desolate places. They also make do with dens in cliff-side caves or mountainstop eyries, but only if no suitable abandoned edifices can be found. When a young maftet comes of age, it receives its runic tattoos from a shaman, usually the eldest female in the pride. The art and magic of creating these tattoos has been passed down from mother to daughter for thousands of years, along with the race's oral history and legends.

Magmin,3,outsider,land,"Built of fire and magma, this short humanoid radiates intense heat that causes the air around it to shimmer.","While magmins populate the Plane of Fire, they sometimes slip through elemental rifts into the Material Plane. These rifts usually occur in places of searing heat, such as volcanoes or underground rivers of magma, or in places of strong, unpredictable magic. The latter scenario usually results in more problematic entrances, as magmins tend to accidently set fire to nearby flammable objects. Though not courageous, these small outsiders still make formidable foes against creature without resistance to their intense heat. Their touch incinerates clothing, and creatures that strike their bodies with steel run the risk of reducing their weapons to slag. Magmins' best defense in their homes on the Plane of Fire is in their sheer numbers. Their settlements, dotted with magma pools and leaping geysers of molten rock, teem with staggering numbers of the creatures. Magmins are paranoid and untrusting. Always fearful of the larger denizens of the Plane of Fire, magmins harangue interlopers with dozens of questions, asking where they are going, where they came from, and what they are doing near the magmins' precious magma pools. If travelers' answers are unsatisfactory, the magmins try to shuffle the creatures off as quickly as possible. Those who refuse to leave risk being thrown into a pool of liquid rock. Magmins take great pride in the cultivation of their magma pools. Each magma pool has a different purpose, such as bathing, cooking meals, or relaxation. Magmins add minerals and salts to these pools to properly season them for their intended uses. Cooking pools  burn hotter than most others, and relaxation pools are generally darker than bathing pools. Upon reaching adulthood, magmins stand 4 feet tall, their dense compositions giving them a weight of 300 pounds.",800

Attempts by arcane spellcasters  to control or harness the power of a magmoid, thus far have failed. Magmoids seem to serve no purpose in the Ecology of their native plane and are thought to be a living extension of the plane itself. Small bubbling pockets on the magmoid's form serve as sensory organs. A giant magmoid, measuring 30 feet across is thought to exist near the Sea of Fire, though none have ever seen it. A magmoid attacks by spraying a blast of superheated magma at opponents or by slamming into and rolling over them. It often targets weapon-wielding creatures first and moves close enough where they can hit with their weapons.

Its face is a featureless plane except for two gouges where there should be eyes.,"Magnesium golems are silvery-white humanoids created by arcane spellcasters. As with other golems, they are incapable of thinking on their own, and are thus under control of the one that created them.

Maharaja,20,outsider,any,"Impeccably dressed and bedecked in exotic jewelry, this fiend holds an ornate saber in its backward-facing hands.","All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear. A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century. So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders-lounging in opulence. The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants. A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly. RAKSHASA RAJADHIRAJAS Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment, and illusion. Other maharajas master various other techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings. Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower than CR 21-most have additional racial Hit Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each additional racial Hit Die granted increases the rakshasa's CR by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja. The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers. Reincarnate : Once per day as a standard action, a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed by a death effect. As with effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be form within one size category of the dead creature's original size-the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.",307200

From its three fanged mouths leap tongues of flame, and crimson saliva leaks from the terror's skeletal jaws.","The mythical watchdogs of Hell, cerberi bear the bodies of terrible, powerful hounds and the essences of fiends. Relied upon by villains and frightful beings as guardians and gaolers, these three-headed canine abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. Such are the cruel devices of Hell, though, that brazen hatred breeds ingenuity and new evils. Thus, within the depths of the infernal realm, amid the indomitable pits and fortresses of Malbolgia, devils work at nightmarish beast pens, forcibly breeding monstrous hybrids. Born in fury and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering their loathed Nessian warhound kindred. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds. Ecology Denizens of Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger. Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances. Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think themselves their masters. Habitat & Society In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers, especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters. Daemons and night hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the soul-hunting hounds. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.",19200
Malenti,2,monstrous humanoid,temperate or warm oceans,A predatory gleam glints in the eyes of this stern-looking waters elf.,"The unpredictability and viciousness of the sahuagin race isn't just an aspect of their sharklike temperament- it seems to be inherent in their very beings. The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest to this, their forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, sahuagin mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in sahuagin communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among their people's rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed sahuagin brutes and malenti- sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves-arise most commonly, though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage seas. Sahuagin Alterations Both the four-armed sahuagin and the malenti use the stats presented on page 239 of the Bestiary as their foundations, with the following alterations. As sahuagin are such common menaces over the course of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path, their variants are included here to make encounters with the shark people even more unpredictable and deadly. Four-Armed Sahuagin: These mutants gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus feats and the multiweapon mastery ability. These changes do not include an increase in such a mutant's Hit Dice, but do increase its CR to 3. Despite the advantages these additions give the creature, its hit points are on the low side for a CR 3 monster. GMs should consider giving four-armed sahuagin armor considerably better than that usually worn by CR 3 monsters to make up for this relative glass jaw. Giving the creature leather armor  grants it a +2 armor bonus, increasing its AC to 18-above the average for its CR, but a considered benefit to help balance out its weakness. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, rangers, and warriors. Malenti: These mutants gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, Deceitful and Skill Focus  as bonus feats, and command as a spell-like ability . Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. The benefits a malenti gains largely offset those it loses, resulting in no change to the creature's CR. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards. Other Sahuagin Mutants Although four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common sahuagin mutants, they are not the only abnormalities to arise from sahuagin stock. The following mutants are also sometimes found in sahuagin societies. While rarer than other mutants, they too quickly garner the respect and fear of their piscine brethren. Prehistoric Sahuagin: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to some even more savage epoch; they are Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with waters dinosaurs and megafauna in addition to sharks. They are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures or waters that are somehow strangely affected by the flow of time. Shark-Blooded Sahuagin: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of sharklike teeth, and the fins and tail of an oversized thresher shark . These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a swim speed of 80 feet, and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Shark-blooded sahuagin are most typically found in sahuagin communities with unusually high numbers of shark guardians and near shark breeding grounds. Spined Sahuagin: Covered in hundreds of needle-like spines, these sahuagin can raise these piercing protrusions to impale creatures that attempt to grab or consume them. Any creature that grapples a spined sahuagin takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training as a bonus feat. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive waters predators.",600
Mallor Demon,3,outsider,any,This large creature appears to be a human with the lower torso of a giant coral snake. Its human frame is crimson-colored.,"Mallors are the creation of some long-forgotten  demon lord who supposedly used dark and powerful magic to combine the best  traits of a demon with the best and worst traits of snakes. Purportedly they were spawned from the same demonic force that created the dreaded marilith. Though originally only encountered on the lowest planes of the Abyss, the mallor's are quickly growing and they can now be found on just about layer of that dreaded plane. Mallors are frequently encountered on the Material Plane in the service of powerful spellcasters seeking to gain some service from them. They disdain mortals, particularly mortal spellcasters, and seek to twist and manipulate them when given the chance. Binding a mallor is a dangerous thing, for if it manages to break free or twist the bargain to its favor, it most assuredly kills or captures the summoner and carries it back to the Abyss never to be seen again. A mallor is a 10 to 12 feet long, powerful, humanoid with the lower torso of a giant coral snake. Its humanoid frame is crimson-colored while its snake body is black with bands of yellow and red. Its arms end in sharpened claws, slightly curved under, just enough to tear through flesh, sinew and muscle. Mallors have black, gold, or amber hair. Their eyes are white with red or green pupils. A mallor is a straightforward combatant in battle and charges directly at its opponents. Normally, it opens battle with burning hands and/or its fear gaze in hopes of affecting as mtargets as possible. The mallor then attempts to move to melee range and touch the nearest spellcaster while using its touch of idiocy. Multiple mallors work in concert with one another; one often drawing the fire away from the others so they can charge in with their massive spears. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Mammoth,10,animal,cold forests or plains,"This massive elephant-like creature is covered in long, coarse hair, and its tusks sweep upward in great curves of yellowed ivory.","The woolly mammoth is a relative of both the common elephant and the mastodon . Like the mastodon, it is an herbivore and spends its days eating nuts, fruits, berries, and grasses. The typical mammoth consumes nearly 450 pounds of food and 50 gallons of waters in a given day. Mammoths travel in herds with the young moving in the center, protected and surrounded by the adults. If danger is present or a threat is imminent, the males move to face the danger, while the females encircle the young. The woolly mammoth generally reproduces in the spring months with young being born about 22 months later. A young woolly mammoth resembles a miniature version of an adult, complete with fur, and under fur. It does not yet have the mighty tusks of the mammoth, though the tusks grow in quickly as the young mammoth reaches maturity . The mammoth has the same predators as the mastodon; the dire wolf, the smilodon, and man. Man hunts these creatures for the same reason they hunt the mastodon: meat, fur, ivory, or to capture young mammoths to be trained as mounts and beasts of burden. The mammoth is a relative of the elephant and the mastodon though its head is slightly taller than an elephant's and slightly wider than a mastodon's. Its upward curving tusks are longer than those of the mastodon, and its trunk ends in two, small finger-like projections used for grasping branches, fruits, and other such small items. The mammoth stands about 22 feet tall and is covered in a thick coat of gray, brown, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or black fur with a coarse ""under-fur"" beneath it to protect it in harsh climates. Mammoths generally avoid combat unless provoked or the herd is threatened. They have no natural fear of creature, so do not flee. If the herd is threatened, mammoths fight by goring with their tusks or trampling. Mammoths fight to the death to protect their young. Training a Mammoth A mammoth must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a mammoth must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly mammoth requires six weeks of work and a successful Handle Animal check . Riding a mammoth requires an exotic saddle. A mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check. Mammoth young are worth 13,000 gp each on the open market. Professional trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train a mammoth. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a mammoth is up to 4,152 pounds; a medium load, 4,153 to 8,304 pounds; and a heavy load, 8,305 to 12,480 pounds. A mammoth can drag 62,400 pounds.

Manananggal,7,undead,land,"This disembodied female torso flaps through the air on batlike wings, her fanged face a hateful mask.","Horrid undead, manananggals walk among the living by day and prey upon them at night. These creatures delight in spreading fear and distrust. By day, they tend to stay inside because of their light sensitivity. They mask this odd behavior by either living just outside villages as reclusive hermits or by obtaining roles within the community that explain away or justify their eccentricities. Manananggals pass themselves off as normal people, usually posing as mad old women, midwives, hedge witches, or mystics. This allows the undead creatures to select their prey from within the community. Manananggals particularly enjoy feeding upon pregnant women, targeting them in their sleep so the undead may feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they carry. These foul creatures drain blood via their long, black, hollow tongues. Manananggals despise the scent of garlic and strong spices like cloves and anise. As they fly through the night, manananggals make a ticking or clicking sound, leading some villagers to call the creatures ""tik-tiks."" Once separated, a manananggal's mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan.",3200
Mandragora,4,plant,cold or temperate forests,"This filthy creature resembles a small, wide-mouthed fat child made from leaves, vines, tree bark, dirt, and pallid tubers.","A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creature's fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks. A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a druid's allies. When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the scrying spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spell's casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a -4 penalty on the save to resist it. A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demon's corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft  check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to its creator.",1200
Mandrill,0.25,animal,warm forests,"This brightly-colored primate has a bushy mane, dense fur, and a long ridged snout.","Mandrills are diurnal and terrestrial primates found in warm forests. During the day, mandrills spend their time on the forests floor, hunting and foraging. At night, the animals seek shelter and refuge in the trees. They subsist on a diet of fruits, nuts, berries, small insects, seeds, roots, and occasionally grass and the typical group has a hunting ground of 5-8 square miles. When foraging, mandrills use their powerful hands aid in pulling bulbs and digging roots. A mandrill is equipped with cheek pouches that begin to the side of its teeth and extend down its neck. The animal can hold almost an entire meal in its pouches. It often stores food in its cheeks while it continues to hunt or climb. A typical mandrill group consists of one or more males, one of which is an alpha male, several females, and an equal number of young . Females have a gestation period of about 5-1/2 months and young are born live . Young generally stay with their mother for about a year . The average adult mandrill reaches a height of just under 3 feet tall and weighs around 35 pounds . A mandrill's fur is olive brown fading to a paler color on its underbelly. Adult males have a bright blue and red snout and a yellowish ""beard."" Females and young mandrills are likewise colored, but their colorations are duller. Mandrills are generally passive creatures and rarely engage in battle, preferring to outmaneuver would-be-attackers by taking to the trees and outrunning their opponents. If the young are threatened, they do not hesitate to attack. Mandrills defending their group always fight to the death. Likewise, a foraging pack that is molested defends its ""treasure"" if food is scarce; otherwise, it usually drops its food  and scurries into the trees. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",100

Mantari appear as large manta rays, gray in color, with a long smooth tail that ends in a sharpened barb. The mantari flies silently through its underground world in search of prey, and when encountered, it is often hungry and immediately attacks. The mantari attacks by slashing and stinging with its tail. Its preferred method of attack is to dive on its target from higher areas, gaining surprise with its sting.

Manticore,5,magical beast,warm hills or marshes,"This creature has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. Its tail ends in long, sharp spikes.","Manticores are fierce predators that patrol a wide area in search of fresh meat. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Some have more human-like heads, usually with beards. Males and females look much alike. Manticores eat meat, even carrion, though they prefer human flesh and rarely pass up an opportunity for such a delicacy. They are smart and social enough to bargain with or bully evil humanoids into alliances or offering tribute, and more powerful creatures may hire or bribe them to guard or patrol a place or area. They like lairs in high places, such as hillstops and caves in cliffs. Although manticores were likely a magical creation, they have long since established themselves as a naturally occurring species. Curiously, manticores seem strangely fecund, and can interbreed with a number of other similarly shaped creatures, including lions, dire lions, lamias, sphinxes, and even chimeras. The progeny of a manticore and an unusual mate is summarized on the table below.

Mantidrake,9,magical beast,any,"This creature resembles a large, powerfully-built lion with a dragon's head where its head would normally be, a pair of large scaly draconic wings, and a long serpentine tail that ends in volley of sharpened spikes.","Mantidrakes were born from fell experiments and dark rituals that crossed evil dragons with manticores. The result: a creature that combines the best and worst traits of both of its parents. From a distance, a mantidrake is often mistaken for a normal manticore. Only when opponents close against it do they see that the creature is something different. Mantidrakes like dragons are territorial predators and often claim a wide expanse of land as their hunting ground. Creatures that wander into a mantidrake's territory rarely go unnoticed, especially during the daylight hours when the mantidrake spends most of its time hunting. Slain prey is either devoured on the spot  or carried back to its lair and stored for later . Mantidrakes are generally solitary creatures though sometimes a pair may be encountered. Such an encounter is with a mated pair. Female mantidrakes are just as common  as males and are just as likely to be encountered as both sexes are skilled hunters. When gestating, a female curtails the time she spends hunting to spend it in the lair preparing both herself and the lair for her young. Young are born live and by 2 years of age they are independent enough to go out hunting on their own. A typical mantidrake is about 10 to 12 feet long and weighs about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds. Its draconic head is scaled and is the same color as its dragon parent. The color slowly fades and meshes with the mantidrake's leonine body which is covered in dull tan fur, except for its underbelly which is scaled like a true dragon's. Its wings are of the same color as its dragon parent, dark, almost black . A mantidrake's environment varies based on its dragon heritage: black mantidrakes can be found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; blue mantidrakes favor warm hills and mountains, rarely being found underground; green mantidrake s favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; red mantidrakes favor warm mountains and underground settings; and white mantidrakes favor cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground environments. Mantidrakes are aggressive combatants and begin most attacks with a blast from their deadly breath weapon. This is followed next by a volley of spikes or a claw/claw/bite routine against the closest opponent. Mantidrakes prefer to use their powerful wings to stay aloft and fight from the air where it can rain a combination of its breath weapon and deadly spikes down on its opponents.

Marai,8,outsider,any,"This finely robed and nimble fiend has six colorful vipers in place of arms, and a long, forked tongue in its fanged mouth.","Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes either the servant or a corpse. The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might to bring would-be heroes, especially those who invade its lair, to their knees. Such a game offers a marai enjoyment, however, only if subjects are unaware of the danger or at least unable to oppose it. A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible, and so it typically assumes humanoid form when working on experiments that require manual dexterity.

Marut,15,outsider,any,"This humanoid is mostly hidden behind plates of elaborate golden armor, the spaces in between revealing flesh of black stone.","Behemoths of onyx and golden armor, maruts shake the ground when they walk, each thunderous step ringing a death knell for those they've come to take. Rarely seeming to hurry, a marut's onslaught is deliberate, purposeful, and relentless. Its quarry may impede it or flee, running for decades or centuries, but from the initial meeting onward, the target must always look over its shoulder with the knowledge that, like death itself, the marut is ever at its heels, slowly but surely approaching, bringing balance through inevitable oblivion. Maruts primarily target those mortal souls who have artificially extended their lifespans beyond what is feasible for their race, such as liches and other powerful magic users. Extraordinary but natural means of cheating death are sometimes also punished, such as the magistrate who murders an entire starving town to save himself, or those who foresee their own deaths via divination magic and are therefore able to avoid them. Although they are capable of speaking eloquently in language, and frequently gather vast amounts of information from those who are intimidated by their mere presence, maruts rarely engage in conversation or strategic alliances with mortals.

Mastodon,13,animal,cold forests,This elephantine beast has a coat of thick fur and stands longer and lower to the ground than a typical pachyderm. Its tusks are long and curved providing it with formidable natural weapons.,"The great mastodon is a distant relative of the common elephant and is linked to that creature through the woolly mammoth . It is a herbivore and is found primarily in forestsed areas. Its teeth are rounded and pointed and make excellent ""tools"" for clipping leaves, branches, and twigs, though its diet also includes things such as grasses, fruits, berries, and nuts. A typical mastodon consumes 400 pounds of food and 50 gallons of waters each day. Mastodons generally deplete an area of its food supply before moving on, traveling in large herds with the young in the center, surrounded by the adults of the herd. The mastodon does not have particular season for reproducing, though most births seem to occur in the winter. Young are born with short thick fur and weigh around 240 pounds. A young mastodon reaches maturity at about age ten. The mastodon has three natural occurring predators; the dire wolf, the smilodon, and man. The latter often hunts the great mastodon for its meat, fur, and the ivory of its tusks. Young mastodons are often captured alive and taken into captivity and trained as mounts of beasts of burden. The mastodon is a distant relative to the elephant though it is slightly longer and lower to the ground, with shorter and thicker legs than the common elephant. Its head is slightly longer and taller than an elephant's and the mastodon's entire body is covered in thick fur of brown, gray, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or black. Its long, upward curving tusks are formed of ivory and are white or yellowish-white in color. Its eyes range from gray to brown to green. An average mastodon stands 20 feet tall. Mastodons are generally peaceful creatures and avoid combat. They have no natural fear of creature, so do not flee. If threatened, or if their young are threatened, mastodons fight by goring with their tusks or trampling foes. Mastodons fight to the death to protect their young. Training a Mastodon A mastodon must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a mastodon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly mastodon requires six weeks of work and a successful Handle Animal check . Riding a mastodon requires an exotic saddle. A mastodon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check. Mastodon young are worth 16,000 gp each on the open market. Professional trainers charge up to 2,500 gp to rear or train a mastodon. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a mammoth is up to 5,592 pounds; a medium load, 5,593 to 11,184 pounds; and a heavy load, 11,185 to 16,800 pounds. A mammoth can drag 84,000 pounds.

Mature Helix Moth,10,vermin,temperate forests,This 20-foot long insect has a black abdomen wrapped with spiraling bands of various color and a white underbelly. Three sets of translucent bluish-violet wings extend from its body. A small black sword-like stinger protrudes from the end of its abdomen and its maw clatters with large gray mandibles.,"Helix moths are solitary creatures, though on rare occasions a mated pair might be encountered. The lair of an adult helix moth is almost always above ground and usually takes the form of a cave, tunnel, or other such structure. Such places are always well-hidden and difficult to reach. When the time comes for a female helix moth to lay her eggs, she hollows out a tunnel in the floor of her lair, forms a large chamber at the end of the tunnel and deposits her eggs in the chamber. Helix moth larvae lair in a large, 6-foot-diameter ridged tunnels that burrow down into the earth where they eventually open into a large chamber at least 20 square feet in size. A thick, gray-white slime coats the chamber's floor and walls. Though harmless to living creatures, but generally not pleasant to touch or come in contact with. Occasionally  the secretions of the helix moth larva mix with the slime just enough to form a deadly inhalant poison that affects living creatures within the chamber. Those breathing the fumes must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A new save must be made every minute. Once a successful save is made, that creature cannot be affected by the fumes again for one day. To lay her eggs, the female helix moth uses her acidic secretions and sharpened mandibles to tunnel a hole into the ground and hollow out a large chamber where she lays 2d4 eggs of greenish-gray color. The eggs hatch two weeks after fertilization, producing the helix moth larvae, though typically only about 50% of the larva live past the first day. Helix moths are normally passive creatures except when hunting. During a search for prey, the creature becomes highly aggressive and does not hesitate to attack creature it encounters. A helix moth often journeys up to a mile or more away from its lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried back to its lair and devoured over a period of several days. The adult helix moth attacks by biting or stinging its prey. Its constant droning affects those that combat it, so the helix moth always tries to stay airborne and within range where it can use this ability while staying out of melee range. Helix moth larvae attack by biting. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600

By this time, their legs have fully developed and their tentacles have become pseudopodlike lashes. They have lost their slime coating but have replaced it with a paralytic venom exuded from the tips of their tentacles. They are even more voracious than in their larval form and activity hunt for ready sources of carrion at the outskirts of settlements, upon old battlefields, or even sewer tunnels beneath large population centers. They become viciously territorial in this stage of their development and, while they may allow other slime crawlers in their midst, other types of creatures had best beware, as they are perfectly happy to feed upon fresher faire. A typical mature slime crawler is about 12 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds. A mature slime crawler attacks with its tentacles, trying to paralyze as mopponents as possible but if particularly hungry may stop in the midst of battle to feed on anyone it has disabled.

Mawler,4,aberration,any,"The collar of the fine new cloak suddenly reveals a set of jagged teeth as you realize that it is a carnivorous creature, and you are wearing it.","Sages are uncertain as to the origin of the mawler, but speculation ranges from it being related to the mimic to it being somehow related to the executioner's hood. Whatever its origins, it is considered by mto be the bane of treasure-seekers everywhere. A mawler's natural form is that of a small blob of fleshy stuff approximately 2 feet across. Mawlers are rarely ever seen in their natural form, however, as they almost always take the shape of an article of clothing made for a Medium humanoid-meals are easy to come by in that form. A mawler can alter its texture, color, and shape to match such substances as leather and metal. A single mawler usually takes on the form of a single article of clothing, such as a hat, helmet, scarf, codpiece, or belt. A pair of these creatures encountered together can take the shape of a pair of boots or a pair of gloves. A mawler radiates an aura of magic, and unwitting victims are often lured into believing that they have found a pair of magic boots or magic gloves-when in reality what they place on their legs or hands will soon grow reveal its true nature-much to the detriment of the would-be treasure hunter. A mawler generally does not engage in melee. It lies in wait for an unsuspecting meal to don it. In the rare instance that a mawler is forced into melee, it attacks with its bite. When an unsuspecting person dons the mimic, it usually waits 1d3 minutes before attacking with its bite. A mawler that scores a critical and severs a victim's limb tries to move away as quickly as possible to digest the meal. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",1200

It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by mto be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elementalbased planes. Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable.

One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.

Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form.

Medium Positive Energy Elemental,4,outsider,Positive Energy Plane,This creature appears as a shimmering and wavering sphere of brilliant white energy with small motes of light winking in and out of existence along its spherical form.,"Positive energy elementals are creatures of pure positive energy. They are found primarily on the Positive Energy Plane, but on rare occasions, one slips through a portal or is summoned to the Material Plane. These creatures seem to be able to communicate with others of their kind by changing the intensity of energy in their bodies and altering their shape ever so slightly. Positive energy elementals hate negative energy elementals and always attack them on sight. Aside from that, positive energy elementals rarely engage in combat. If confronted however and forced into battle, the creature responds by pummeling its foes with its powerful fists dealing positive energy to its foe. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Medium Stingray,2,animal,warm waters,"A wide, sail-like creature glides through the waters dragging a barbed, whip-like tail behind it.","Stingrays are bottom feeders and are found in warm, shallow waters near coastlines and shores. They sustain themselves on a diet of plankton, waters plants, small crabs, and small fish. Larger stingrays, like smaller rays, are found in shallow, warm waters, though these creatures often swim into much deeper waters. Giant stingrays feed on creatures such as fish, giant crabs, octopus, and sharks. They are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts and often engage prey larger than themselves, relying on their poison to bring down a foe. Female stingrays are usually larger than males. Young stingrays resemble adult rays, but are much smaller in size. During birth, the young's pectoral fins are folded against its body but open as soon as it is born. Stingrays are completely flat with no discernible head. At one end is a long, whip-like tail that ends in a razor-sharp and serrated barb. Their eyes appear as small bumps on the end opposite the tail and their mouth is located on the underside of their body. The sides of a stingray are composed of large, wide pectoral fins . Stingrays are brown, black, or slate gray and their underbelly is white. Small stingrays are about three feet across, while the largest ray measures 12 feet across. Small stingrays are generally inoffensive creatures. Most ""attacks"" occur in shallow waters when a creature steps on a buried ray. If stepped on, the stingray lashes out with its stinger. If threatened by an opponent much larger than it, the stingray attempts to sting its opponent and then flees. Larger stingrays are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts, and some are very active when searching for prey. They are nocturnal hunters and attack using a tail sting or wing buffet.

Medusa,7,monstrous humanoid,temperate marshes or underground,"This slender, attractive woman has strangely glowing eyes and a full head of hissing snakes for hair.","Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampsy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conf licts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence. Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld. Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings. All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner-at least until she grows tired of his company.",3200
Medusa Head,3,undead,any,"This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.","Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how mcan be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in way and applied to of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching : A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type  chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning : This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn  special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing : This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming : Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chillsing scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming skull's Cha modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same beheaded's scream for 24 hours.",800

Megaloceros Elk,4,animal,cold or temperate plains,"This majestic beast stands the height of a man at its shoulders, a many-tipped rack of proud antlers crowning its head.","Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of mwildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove important parts of mecologies, being able to fend off or flee mthreats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Mhumanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the rivers elk seen throughout the rivers Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against mwould-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, mhumanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as mas 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise  it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the rivers Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, rivers elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter waters, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forestsed areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

Melfesh Monster,6,plant,any,"Covered with mossy growths and creeping vines, this towering creature glides effortlessly across the ground. A hood of damp moss and crusty bark conceals the monster's face.","The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly. Ecology Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, fey-stricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories. The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror. Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long. Habitat & Society Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia  to mobilize significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns. To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identif ied . In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inf lated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster. Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past.",2400

Mercane,5,outsider,land or underground,"The tall, blue-skinned humanoid is clad in loose, flowing robes. Its alien face has too meyes and its hands have too few fingers.","Mysterious merchants of all things magical, mercanes are relatively weak and noncombative for creatures of their size. They prefer to bargain and haggle rather than to fight, but because they wander the planes seeking and trading magical goods, they typically travel with an entourage of hired bodyguards. Mercanes are capable of defending themselves, and often carry masterwork Large falchions. Yet these weapons are primarily for show, as mercanes prefer to let their bodyguards deal with violent opponents. If a situation turns ugly, mercanes typically use their magical abilities to flee, abandoning their hirelings if necessary. Mercanes are known throughout the planes as traders in magical items. Each has a secret chest filled with wares stashed away, ready to be pulled out when it's time to haggle and close a deal . Mercanes are therefore not easily robbed, and they only surrender the contents of a secret chest when they have no other choice. Mercanes have no interest in mundane goods, no matter how fine or rare. Only magical objects earn their attention and their coin. They're known for driving hard, but fair, bargains, and for hiring adventurers from time to time to recover certain goods of interest for a fair price.

Stories claim the mercanes feed on the magic items they acquire, or even need them in order to reproduce. There are also tales of a war in a far corner of the planes, with the mercanes serving the roles of arms merchants, aggressors, or defenders, depending on who tells the story. Mercanes are 10 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds.",1600
Mercury Ooze,4,ooze,underground,This creature resembles a swirling thick pool of silvery-white mercury.,"Created by some bizarre and broken arcane experiment in ages past, the mercury ooze is a monster best left alone. The mercury ooze is about 8 feet long and 6 inches thick. It can compress its body to a thickness of 1 inch to slip into cracks and crevices.

Merfolk,0.33,humanoid,temperate oceans,"Slipping in and out of the crashing waves, this beautiful woman has the lower torso of a long, slender fish.","From the waist up, merfolk bear the torsos of well-built humans and delicate features reminiscent of elves and other humanoids tied to the natural world. A merfolk's lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males. Although amphibious, merfolk move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea. It is quite rare for a merfolk to make contact with a creature not of its kind. In fact, mgo to great lengths to steer sailors away from their lands, even resorting to violence if necessary. Ancient accounts hint at merfolk protecting a terrible secret bound to the depths, and though no reports mention what this secret is, the lengths merfolk go to remain isolated from other races highlight the importance of this safeguard. While merfolk outwardly appear to be a beautiful and powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that degenerate and mutated merfolk roam the deepest, most isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding that even those merfolk who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea. Merfolk Characters Merfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All merfolk have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma: Merfolk are graceful, hale, and beautiful. +2 Natural Armor: Merfolk have tough skin. waters: Merfolk are waters and can breathe waters. Their land speed is 5 feet, but their swim speed is 50 feet. They are amphibious, but prefer not to spend long periods out of the waters. Low-Light Vision: All merfolk have low-light vision.

Metallic Ooze,6,ooze,underground,A large pile of seemingly unguarded coins lies before you.,"A metallic ooze appears as a 9-foot blob of protoplasm of varying hue and color, and come in a variety of sizes and colors: gold, silver, platinum, copper, brass, or bronze. Regardless of the color or size, metallic oozes resemble large piles of coins. The oozes use their appearance to lure wouldbe treasure hunters to their doom. Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as hoard oozes. Its form is coarse and rough giving it the appearance of piles of coins. A metallic ooze can flatten its body in order to squeeze through spaces and cracks where it normally could not go. A metallic ooze can be found virtually anywhere, though it tends to inhabit dungeons, ruined temples, castles, and other buildings where treasure seekers seem to enjoy perfecting their craft. From a distance of 30 feet or more, a metallic ooze resembles a pile of loose coins . A creature can attempt a DC 20 Perception check to notice the ooze for what it is. This monster does not collect treasure, but the remnants of living creatures that meet their demise at the hands of this creature are often found scattered about its lair. A metallic ooze lies still until it detects a potential meal within range. It then forms a pseudopod and pummels the opponent. Creatures killed by a metallic ooze are devoured. While a metallic ooze can cling to walls and ceilings , it prefers to wander dungeon corridors and such on the ground, often waiting in one spot until living prey wanders too close.

Mezzalorn Demon,11,outsider,any,"This creature looks like a cross between a giant red-banded wasp and a grotesque olive-skinned humanoid. It has the body of a giant wasp, complete with stinger and wings. The creature possesses two human-like arms that end in wicked claws. Its human-like head sports a mouth filled with fangs and two small horns that jut from its head.","Mezzalorns  are entities akin to the fly or stirge demons. They spend most of their time flying high above the Abyssal planes scouring the lands for food or patrolling a demon lord's domain if they are in the service of such a demon. When serving under a demon lord or one of his generals, mezzalorns are often utilized as shock troops or first-assault troops in war. Mezzalorns are thoroughly evil and despise all non-demons, attacking them on sight. Slain creatures are carried back to their lair and distributed among the inhabitants of the nest. Among demonkind they despise stirge demons with an unbridled hatred and always attack them on sight, fighting to the death when battling them. Slain stirge demons are not eaten by wasp demons , but are completely and utterly destroyed, their bodies being torn to pieces or injected with so much venom as to liquefy their internals. A mezzalorn makes its lair in rocky outcroppings or in underground burrows and tunnels on the various abyssal planes. They generally avoid the less hospitable planes composed of acids, oozes, slimes, waters, or vapors as they require a solid surface on which to build their nests. A nest is composed of just about anything a mezzalorn can find and carry: bones, debris, refuse, weapons, and so on. A mezzalorn stands as tall as a human and is about 10 feet long. Its body is dark with red bands and ends in a golden stinger. Its legs resemble those of a giant wasp and are covered in fine hairs and bristles. Its human-like visage is copper and sports matted dark hair. Its horns are black. Mezzalorn tactics are simple and straightforward: fly into battle, sting a foe repeatedly until it dies. Often a mezzalorn grabs a foe, flies upward away from the opponent's allies, and stings its grappled victim until it dies, dropping the carcass without thought or care before wading back into the battle.

Mi-Go,6,plant,any,"This unnaturally graceful creature has a bulbous fungoid lump for a head, spiny insectoid wings, and a tangle of spiky, clawed legs.","Mi-go are both scientists and colonists-extraterrestrial travelers from the Dark Tapestry who view the universe as a canvas to be mastered and controlled. Their numbers on particular planet can vary, but taken on a galactic scale, these numbers can only be mind-numbing in scope. A typical mi-go is roughly the size of a human, but weighs only 90 pounds. Ecology Although a mi-go's shape might suggest an arthropod, especially with its long, insect-like limbs and diaphanous wings, the creature is in fact a highly evolved form of extraterrestrial fungus. Mi-go communicate via a combination of clicking of pincers and subtle shifts in the coloration of their bulbous heads-other creatures can learn this language, but without similar biologies  can only hope to ""listen"" to a mi-go. A mi-go can speak in a strange, buzzing voice, but generally only does so when forced to speak to other creatures. Habitat & Society Mi-go goals on the planets they invade and colonize can vary, from stripping them of mineral resources to seeking biological resources for their scientific experiments. Mi-go are often viewed as gods or demons by the more primitive societies they encounter, and are fond of capitalizing upon these fears to further their own agendas. Masters of disguise, they often infiltrate societies so as to better manipulate, harvest, and eventually consume the society for their own needs. Despite their skill in this regard, they generally keep the core strongholds of their operations in remote regions-hillsy and mountains areas are favored for the preponderance of caves and other natural features that are easily converted into defensible hideouts. Although masters of strange biological technologies, migo are also quite fervent in religious matters. Most worship Shub-Niggurath, for they view this goddess's fecundity as the pinnacle of their own biological technologies and skills. A mi-go sees very little difference between the cold hard facts of science and the intensely interpretative complexities of faith. Mi-Go Technology The mi-go mastery of surgical and biological technologies incorporates the magical; the techniques they utilize in their pursuit of world colonization manifest in a wide range of strange and frightening tools. These devices merge magic and technology in strange and unsettling ways. For the most part, mi-go technology functions identically to normal magic items-the devices simply look disturbing and weird to other creatures. The function of mi-go technological items can be identified as if they were normal magic items, but with a -5 penalty on the Spellcraft check. Likewise, attempts to utilize mi-go technology with Use Magic Device take a -5 penalty. At the GM's discretion, after a character becomes familiar with mi-go technology , these penalties might vanish. While you can simulate mi-go technology by simply describing existing magic items as strange and unusual things , other items should be more unique, such as the following example. Brain Cylinder Aura moderate necromancy; CL 9th Slot none; Price 5,000 gp; Weight 10 lbs. Description A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation-the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.

Mihstu,8,outsider,any,"A miasmal form roils as barbed tentacles emerge from the central mass, coalescing into razor-sharp talons and claws.","The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty. Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs.",4800
Mimi,1,fey,cold forests or plains,"This tiny fey resembles a 1-foot tall elf with small bee-like wings, silver hair, milk white skin, and icy blue eyes. It is dressed in colorful garments of blue, silver, or green and carries a tiny short sword in a scabbard slung across its backs, resting between its wings.","Mimis are 1-foot tall mischievous creatures that inhabit cold forests and fields and derive pleasure from playing tricks on creatures that wander into their icy realm. Mimi tricks are always harmless and include such things as throwing snowballs at a creature, creating a patch of ice on the ground and watching a creature slip and fall, or turning invisible and sneaking into a sleeping creature's camp wherein they put snow or ice in the creature's boots, clothes, or backpack. While frolicsome, mimis are generally good-natured and friendly towards those they encounter. They often lend aid to creatures in need, especially those that have helped a mimi in the past. Mimis will not lend aid or assistance to creatures of a malign nature and tend to avoid such creatures if possible. They are on good terms with most other fey creatures, though they find brownies to be a little too ""stiff"" for their liking and buckawns to be a bit too gruff. Druids and rangers can detect the presence of a mimi or group of mimis with a successful DC Survival check. Mimis are non-aggressive creatures and rarely attack, unless potential adversaries are inherently evil. They prefer to avoid combat if at all possible but if drawn in, they open using their frost fingers. Against more powerful opponents, mimis begin combat by blasting their foes with a cone of cold. A persistent foe that wishes to continue the battle against a mimi  is subjected to a rapid decrease in the surrounding temperature. A mimi lowers the temperature just enough to possibly damage an adversary  and maybe force it away; its goal is not to kill it. Mimis usually turn invisible and flee if they cannot drive their opponents away. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Mimic,4,aberration,any,"What appeared to be a chest filled with treasure comes to life as it grows long, glistening tentacles and a number of sharp teeth.","Mimics are thought to be the result of an alchemist's attempt to grant life to an inanimate object through the application of an eldritch reagent, the recipe for which is long lost. Over time, these strange but clever creatures have learned the ability to transform themselves into simulacra of man-made objects, particularly in locations that have infrequent traff ic by small numbers of creatures, thus increasing their odds of successfully attacking their victims. Though mimics are not inherently evil, some sages believe that mimics attack humans and other intelligent creatures for sport rather than merely for sustenance. The desire to completely fool others is thought to be a part of their being, and their surprise attacks against others are a culmination of those desires. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet  and weighs about 900 pounds. Legends and tales speak of mimics of much greater sizes, with the ability to assume the form of houses, ships, or entire dungeon complexes that they festoon with treasure  to lure unsuspecting food within.",1200

Mindslaver mold seeks humanoid hosts, parasitizing them even as it manipulates them into serving as its bodyguards and protectors.",800
Minor Grim Reaper,10,undead,any,"This tall, cloaked figure stares out from the black hood that covers its head. It wields an enormous scythe in its skeletal, bone-white hands, looking as though it is freezing the very air around it.","Known by mnames throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves. While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master's dreadful will and meet out death's unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds. Ecology Grim reapers have no creator and are not born by definition of the word-they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does. Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized death's terminal permanency. Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper. While similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed. Habitat & Society While grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in their endeavors. Among their mpowers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals. These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding. While stripped of their more powerful brethren's necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective. Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary. If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets. Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm. Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell create greater undead.",9600
Minotaur,4,monstrous humanoid,temperate ruins or underground,"With the body of a powerfully built man and the head of a snarling bull, this creature stomps its hooves as if preparing to charge.","Nothing holds a grudge like a minotaur. Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deif ic curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Mcultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet. The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baff le and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals. Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master. Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins.",1200
Mire Brute,13,outsider,temperate marshes,This creature resembles a vaguely humanoid monster about 12 feet tall covered with slime. Sharpened wooden stakes seemingly jut from its body at various points and angles. No discernible facial features are present.,"Mire brutes, when dormant, appear as large stretches of mud bristling with wooden stakes. It lies in wait for lone or distracted targets, at which time it rises and attacks, assuming a vaguely humanoid form, its surface glistening with slime and detritus. Lacking discernible sensory organs, it shambles about, looking to kill anything it detects nearby. Towering over 12 feet tall, and of an instable structure, it lurches about, on thick featureless legs, dripping muck over the battlefield. Stupid and destructive, it fights blindly, targeting whatever comes within its reach. The most repellant attack form available to the mire brute is its ability to unleash a slough of putrid fluid, squirming insects and worms. Conceivably more of these foul creatures exist, but none have been spotted before and it is believed that this monster is unique. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",25600
Mite,0.25,fey,underground,"This squat humanoid seems to be nearly all head-an unfortunate circumstance, considering how ugly its puffy blue face is.","Descended from even smaller fey, the mites are among the most pitiful and craven dwellers of the dark. Hideously ugly, even goblins have been known to mock mites for their homely appearances, mockery most mites take to heart and nurture for weeks, months, or even years in their tiny homes, until their distress and anger finally overcome their natural cowardice and impel them forth on short-lived bouts of bloody vengeance from the doubtful safety of a spider's back. Mites, once closer to the strange realm of the fey, have grown larger and stockier after countless generations spent on the Material Plane. Yet still, their stature places them at the bottom of the pile in the dangerous caverns in which they live. Their traditional enemies are dwarves and gnomes, particularly the svirfneblin of the deep underground caves. The one thing that gives them a significant edge over an enemy in a fight is their natural ability to empathize with normally mindless vermin- mites are particularly fond of spiders, centipedes, and cave fishers, and a mite colony usually has a few of these far more dangerous monsters on hand to defend the group. Although they have lost the supernatural ability to tinker with magic items, luck, or mechanical objects possessed by their more sinister and dangerous gremlin kin, mites retain the ability to perform minor magical tricks with prestidigitation, and often use these tricks to annoy their enemies. When faced with dangerous foes, a mite uses its doom ability to hex a foe-a mite's eyes bulge hideously open when it uses this spell-like ability. A mite is 3 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.",100

Mobogo,10,magical beast,temperate swamps,"This grotesque creature looks like a gigantic toad with leathery wings, fangs, horns, and three bulbous eyes.","Huge and hungry, mobogos merge the features of gigantic toads and swampsy dragons, and lair in the deepest, oldest swamps. Here, whole tribes of boggards serve the beasts' fickle, capricious whims. Mobogos reside in the most primal swamps of the world, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for centuries. Boggards believe that in ancient times, after their fecund demon goddess deposited her frogspawn in the muddy morass of the world's still-forming continents, mobogos were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever since, the mobogos have slept and fed, preying upon the beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic, and dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their godly mother's return. Nearly all mobogos are attended by tribes of boggards.

Mockingfey,1,fey,forests,This tiny sprite has the head of a humanoid and the body of a brilliantly colored parrot.,"Mockingfey originally stem from the First World, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or mockingdells, inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly shifts shape to become a perfect, miniature doppelganger of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unf lattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish. This gibberish is not solely for comic effect, as while mockingfey are eager  students in most matters, they refuse to use verbal language of sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain the things they describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances. Those who think them mere beasts, however, are quickly set straight, as enemies of mockingfey are confronted with disorienting magic and the mockingfey's capricious allies from the First World. While mpeople find mockingfeys' antics irritating, the little creatures are surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well, and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly well informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as the portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and the First World. When such planar rifts occur, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, with colonies found in Kyonin, the rivers Kingdoms, and sylvan groves around the Inner Sea. Those illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars  often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A typical mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.",400
Mohrg,8,undead,any,A thick tangle of discolored entrails clings to this lurching skeleton's torso and winds upward to loll from its jaw like a clawed tongue.,"Those who slay mover the course of their lifetimes, be they serial killers, mass-murderers, warmongering soldiers, or battle-driven berserkers, become marked and tainted by the sheer weight of their murderous deeds. When such killers are brought to justice and publicly executed for their heinous crimes before they have a chance to atone, the remains sometimes return to unlife to continue their dark work as a mohrg. Undead things caring less for life than they did before their own deaths, mohrgs exist solely to wreak havoc on the living. Sometimes mistaken for skeletons or zombies, they are far more dangerous than those mindless abominations, retaining some semblance of their own memories-and the delight they once took in hearing the screams of the dying. When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, seeking out lone targets much as they did in life. If faced with capable foes, a mohrg attempts to incapacitate them one by one, starting with divinely empowered characters first, both to protect itself from holy wrath, and to make the task of paralyzing and devouring the others that much easier. Some mohrgs retain enough of their former memories that they return to the favored locations of their pasts, ""haunting"" old hideouts and sometimes even resuming the depredations of murderers long dead, falling back on means of death and mayhem that were more comfortable in their breathing days. Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life's work of slaughter and murder as best they can. Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society's dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg's attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg's control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.",4800
Mokele-Mbembe,9,animal,tropical lakes or rivers,"A triangular reptilian head with a mouth full of curved teeth, attached to a long snaking neck, rises from the surface of the waters. Long spines run down its neck, back, and whip-like tail, which uncurls to snap the air with a loud report.","Known as ""waters lions"" in some local tongues, mokelembembe are large, reptilian predators that inhabit the hottest jungles, always close to lakes, rivers, or other large bodies of waters. A mokele-mbembe's long, whiplike tail accounts for half its length. Its dense, fourlegged body is the size and shape of an elephant's, and its greenish-brown hide has the texture of tree bark. An adult mokele-mbembe can grow up to 40 feet in length and weighs almost 10 tons. Males are only slightly longer and heavier than females. Ecology Although they resemble some larger, herbivorous dinosaurs, mokele-mbembe are cunning and territorial predators. They make their lairs in riverside caves, close to their food source, where they can sun themselves after eating. Natural swimmers, mokele-mbembe have webbed feet, but their long legs enable them to move easily on land as well. They spend much of their time in the waters, where they can relax and float or use their long necks to attack while submerged, favoring blind rivers bends to ambush prey. Mokele-mbembe require large quantities of food daily, and feed on fish, birds, and even large mammals-humanoids included. Hippopotamuses are a favorite prey, and mokele-mbembe attack them on sight. Battles between these two rivers giants are legendary among local tribes, whose shamans often see portents or prophecies in the outcomes. A mokele-mbembe's powerful jaws contain sharp teeth for tearing chunks of meat from prey. The barklike texture of the creature's hide is actually caused by a network of osteoderms that provide added protection against competing predators and larger herbivores. Thanks to a pair of parallel, beam-like bones at the top of its rear legs, the mokele-mbembe carries a massive tail that tapers from a wide base to an end no wider than a half ling's finger. A vast array of muscles and flexible vertebrae within the tail let the creature move this appendage with surprising speed. By sharply reversing motion up and down the length, it can crack its tail like an enormous bullwhip. Louder than a thunderclap, this sonic boom is not only a potent weapon, but also a booming call to other members of the mokele-mbembe's pack over large distances, summoning them either to share a kill or to defend the group's young. Habitat & Society Although they are most commonly encountered alone, mokele-mbembe form mated pairs to hatch and rear their young once every 3 years. A female lays a clutch of 5 to 6 enormous, hard-shelled eggs in a cavern near the waters, with the eggs hatching in 90 days. Mokelembembe young are small upon hatching-no larger than a goat or foal-and are extremely vulnerable during the first 4 to 5 weeks of life. Mfall prey to large snakes, leopards, crocodiles, and even dire bats. It is rare for even half a clutch to survive these initial weeks. Mothers stay close to their young during this time, while the fathers hunt and bring food back to the nest. As hatchlings grow, the father ceases to bring food back from his kills, and instead uses his tail to call both mother and hatchlings to the site of the kill, forcing the young to venture forth to gain food. Mokele-mbembe reach maturity at an alarming rate, growing to full size in just over a year, and reaching reproductive maturity at 2 years of age. Mokele-mbembe occasionally form packs, but only in areas where food is prevalent, as a large pack can kill and eat an entire bloat of hippopotamuses in under a week's time. Most packs are formed of three to four unrelated males and one to two females close to reproductive age. Scholars have noted that males bring food to a female preparing to lay eggs for fertilization. Females choose their mates from the largest and strongest of pack members, based primarily on who provides the largest offering. Some sages purport that this practice is the genesis of the mokele-mbembe's feud with hippos, because the fat-heavy waters horses provide an abundant energy source for females preparing to reproduce. Once females choose their mates, uncoupled males usually leave the pack to hunt on their own. Surprisingly, the mokele-mbembe males are relatively good-natured in their competition for mating rights, and outside of the desperate race to find more food for a female-a struggle that can sometimes lead to devastating attacks on human villages-the competitors almost never resort to violent displays against each other. jungles-dwelling elves and humans respect mokelembembe for their strength and for the sound of their ""thunder."" Lizardfolk, however, revere mokele-mbembe as vessels of divine power, and are the only humanoid race that can successfully train and domesticate them, using them as pack beasts, hunting companions, and battle mounts. Often sharing the same territory, black dragons sometimes use their charm reptiles ability to press mokele-mbembe into servitude, using them as guards for their underwaters lairs.",6400

When a moss troll spots prey, it reaches or leaps down from above, heedless of dropping great distances in its eagerness to sate its ravenous appetite. Moss trolls are fearless except in the face of fire, which does not stop a hungry moss troll from attacking, but can often cause a wounded one to retreat.

A mountains lion's den is usually found under an overhanging ledge, a crevice in a cliff, a dense thicket, or a cavity under the roots of large trees, or occasionally a dry, rock-strewn cave. mountains lions stand about two feet tall and are about four to five feet long with a two to three foot long tail. A typical mountains lion weighs around 125 pounds. It has short, coarse, fur with a white underbelly and a black-tipped tail. Its fur color  is typically brown, black, rust, or gray. Its eyes are golden. Newborn cubs have spots and blue eyes. The spots rapidly disappear as the cub ages and within nine months the spots are gone. Its eyes change from blue to golden within 12-18 months. The mountains lion has a lifespan of 18 years. mountains lions are ambush hunters and stalkers. They wait in dense vegetation or underbrush, or rocky outcroppings for potential prey to wander by. When in range, the mountains lion springs to the attack and bites and rakes its foe. mountains lions are excellent hunters and often stalk potential prey for several miles before attacking.

mountains Troll,14,humanoid,cold mountains,"This enormous, stooped creature has powerful limbs; a mane of gritty brown fur; and a ferocious, tusked underbite.","Though grotesque, charmless, and prone to fits of violence, mountains trolls are not inherently evil, nor do they always attack intruders on sight. A mountains troll prefers to withdraw and observe before entering combat, lumbering forth to attack only if intruders make clear their intentions to harm it or its allies, or if the newcomers seem to be encroaching upon the troll's territory rather than simply passing through. Once enraged, a mountains troll is a savage opponent, calling upon its native strength and alliances with elementals to bury its opponents in stone or spread their entrails across the slopes. mountains trolls prefer to live in narrow ravines or shallow caves that allow them to look out over the landscape. They sometimes knuckle-walk like a gorilla, but when angered they rear up to their full height of nearly 30 feet. mountains trolls have a close association with the First World, similar to that possessed by gnomes, which grants them magical abilities and unusual patience. They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial responsibility. Lesser trolls often capitalize upon mountains trolls' generosity, but take care to abide by their larger cousins' rules when sheltering in their homes. mountains trolls have even been known to aid explorers or give advice, provided they are treated with respect.",38400

She can assume a human form and this form is almost always of a female with darkened skin, raven-black hair, and copper eyes. She dresses in robes of flowing silver or gray. The Mouse Lord spends her days roaming the Material Plane, Astral Plane, and Ethereal Plane. The Mouse Lord enters combat using her bite. Most often she enters battle with greater magic fang already affecting her. When enough foes are within range, she unleashes her confusion ability and usually displaces on her next turn. If combat goes against her, she summons other rodents to aid her or to cover her escape. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Erica Balsley.",25600

Moxix,20,outsider,warm jungles,"This strange, four-armed fiend appears to be constructed completely out of stone. Dried blood stains its body.","Moxix, the Drinker of Human Hopes, is a unique demon bound to the mysterious isle called Yoha's Graveyard in the Shackles. Appearing as an eldritch four-armed statue of weathered gray stone, Moxix has a single emerald eye centered in his horrible face. A nest of twisted horns rests atop his head, and his fang-f illed maw is perpetually stained with blood. Those courageous explorers traveling to his seemingly idyllic isle are driven mad by strange visions and dreams, or by inscrutable but disturbing carvings, idols, and glyphs that litter the island. Even if they withstand the island's maddening magic, adventurers in search of legendary lost riches may confront Moxix himself and be scourged of mind, body, and soul. Moxix's baleful presence and malevolent awareness leer from every crudely carved icon, relief, and idol bearing his likeness, bringing with them a tinge of insanity and a ravenous hunger for human flesh. Ghosts and pentagram-branded cannibals and lunatics are all that remain of ill-fated expeditions to Yoha's Graveyard. Moxix found his first worshipers among the terrible cyclopes of Ghol-Gan as their civilization fell into ruin. As the one-eyed giants slipped more and more into depravity and violence, they began worshiping foul, otherworldly creatures their brothers and sisters brought up from the vaults of the Darklands after their exposure to the serpentfolk's wicked ways. Among the dozens of fiendish icons was Moxix, who came into inf luence among the cyclopes as their practice of sacrifice and cannibalism increased. It was at this time Moxix became known as the Drinker of Human Hopes. The ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes fed him hundreds of captured humans, most of whom were of Azlanti descent. In one instance early in his time among the Ghol-Gan cyclopes, Moxix's followers captured an entire Azlanti embassy and fed them to the strange demon one by one while their companions watched in horror. Some say the sacrifices' spirits still inhabit the region, their wailing cries drifting through the hills and jungles of the haunted island. As his reign of blood began to spread from its base in southern Ghol-Gan, a raging contingent of rival cyclopes from elsewhere in the failing empire raided the demon-worshiping clan dedicated to Moxix, bringing both brute strength and the magic of powerful shamans and oracles to bear against it. The battle raged for 2 days, and in the end an oracle sacrificed her life in a final ploy to destroy Moxix. However, the oracle only succeeded in binding him to the high mountains peak that would one day become the island known as Yoha's Graveyard. To this very day, Moxix remains trapped in his island domain, ever eager to draw creatures to the ziggurat he calls home. There he delights in turning people to cannibalism, destruction, and insanity. Obscuring and disease-laden mists swirl around the island, keeping its lands hidden and protected from trespassers. Once per year, however, on the first full moon after the rainy season, the mists part for a single night. Some explorers have mounted expeditions to Moxix's island during these events, but as of yet, no one has returned the same person she used to be; all bear the mark of insanity Moxix stamps on their being.",307200

Mudbog,3,ooze,marshes,What you originally thought was a patch of muddy waters reveals itself to be a protoplasmic life-form resembling a giant brownish-black amoeba.,"Mudbogs are strange, slow-moving, pudding-like creatures that dwell in swamps, fens, and wetlands. Situated comfortably in its hole along well-traveled paths, a mudbog is likely to be mistaken for a patch of muddy waters or a wet spot in the road. Creatures attempting to simply walk over or through the ""mud puddle"" find themselves stuck fast and, worse yet, being consumed by the hungry ooze. A mudbog doesn't really attack its opponents; its method of getting a meal is strictly passive. However, once a meal stumbles into its protoplasmic body, the mudbog is determined not to let it escape. They are brownish in color, resembling nothing more than brackish mud. These monsters use their coloration to their best advantage and use their acidic bodies to dig a hole, usually several feet deep, in which to lie in wait for a meal. The average mudbog is roughly 10 feet across and 3 feet deep. A mudbog lacks the intelligence to collect treasure. However, the possessions of its victims can always be found in a heap at the bottom of the hole it has chosen as its home. Actually getting to the treasure involves somehow removing the mudbog from its hole. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",800

Mud pools are formed where the Plane of Earth and the Plane of waters commingle in the multiverse, and thus mudmen are born. Occasionally, a vortex opens to a region on the Material Plane where magical waters have stagnated against the land, thereby forming a mud pool. Mudmen pass through this vortex to the Material Plane. Though not evil, mudmen look with disdain on who trespass in their mud pools. When a living creature enters a mud pool, the mudman forms its humanoid shape  and attacks until the opponent is slain or leaves the mud pool. A mudman attacks by pummeling a foe with its fists or by hurling globs of mud.

Mummy,5,undead,any,"Wrapped from head to toe in ancient strips of moldering linen, this humanoid moves with a shuff ling gait.","Created to guard the tombs of the honored dead, mummies are ever vigilant for those who would desecrate their sacred ground. Mummies are created through a rather lengthy and gruesome embalming process, during which all of the body's major organs are removed and replaced with dried herbs and flowers. After this process, the flesh is anointed with sacred oils and wrapped in purified linens. The creator then finishes the ritual with a create undead spell. Although most mummies are created merely as guardians and remain loyal to their charge until their destruction, certain powerful mummies have much more free will. The majority are at least 10th-level clerics, and are often kings or pharaohs who have called upon dark gods or sinister necromancers to bind their souls to their bodies after death-usually as a means to extend their rule beyond the grave, but at times simply to escape what they fear will be an eternity of torment in their own afterlife.",1600

It is bent on exacting revenge against its killers and against all living creatures it crosses. Driven mad by its unliving existence, the murderborn has blurred its senses into believing that every living creature is responsible for its current state and it never hesitates to attack that come within range of it. A murder-born is always encountered within 500 feet of the place it was killed, and can never move further away than that. It is a solitary creature, though very rarely, when twins are involved, two of these cursed creatures may be encountered together. Neither is aware of the other's presence; they do not communicate, interact, or even see each other. They are oblivious to the other's existence. Whether this is because the creatures are so driven with rage it blinds them, or because some magical and mystical force prevents them from interacting is unknown. Murderborns do not speak or communicate but seem to understand a variety of languages. A murder-born closes quickly when it detects living creatures in its realm. Once it and at least one opponent are within 60 feet of one another, it unleashes its despondent wail. It then moves to melee range and uses its incorporeal touch to destroy its enemies.

Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like ""innocence,"" ""despair,"" and ""hope"" in the ripeness of rancid meat, although whether this is true or simply part of the myceloids' twisted sense of humor is unclear. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with white lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores grow tenaciously in living flesh, causing a rapid spread of painful purple lesions that, in advanced stages of the sickness, sprout tiny purple mushrooms; plucking these mushrooms is painful to the victim and causes bleeding. This condition, known as purple pox, is the method by which myceloids both season their meat and procreate. Myceloids prefer to capture victims alive for later infection and control. To a myceloid, a living creature has three uses-first as a slave, second as a host from which to birth new myceloids, and finally as a banquet to feast upon once the first two destinies have played out",1200

Called ""mystery cultists"" by most Magnimarians because of their small numbers and esoteric manner of worship, the dedicated followers of the empyreal lords keep to themselves and rarely proselytize. Most mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues.

Nightripper,24,outsider,any,"Twin talons attached to grotesque back-appendages drip blood from this hideously emaciated, jackal-legged albino demon.","Even today, centuries after his 13th and final execution, memories of Riktus Scroon continue to haunt the nightmares of those who live along the northern coastlines of the Inner Sea. During his reign of horror, the man who would come to be known as the Nightripper used his position in the now disbanded Graven Guard of Taldor to move along the shipping lanes with ease. His position among the mercenary compafforded him time in countless settlements from Golisfar to Corentyn, and in these unsuspecting towns he hunted. Scroon preferred young victims, that their vanishing would cause the most distress possible-his favorites were young adults freshly in love, although he seemed to have had no preference between man or woman. He abducted his victims with astonishing skill, tormenting them for hours with his blades before leaving them broken and bleeding to death at the bottom of a specially prepared pit far outside of town. The mass murderer was finally captured by Cesandra Dayne, an obsessed priest of Sarenrae who had lost her fiancee and her father to Scroon. Only by forsaking the teachings of her church was she able to trap the murderer in the slums of Almas, and although the resulting fight saw the death of a dozen innocent bystanders, in the end Cesandra had her man alive. After Scroon was turned over to the law in his hometown of Oppara, the authorities thought to prosecute him for the deaths of no fewer than 46 known victims. When Scroon gleefully bragged of having murdered nearly a thousand men, women, and children, the authorities were eager to write off his ravings, yet after Scroon provided exacting details to the sites of 953 victims, and one after the other his directions led to actual graves, the killer's sentencing was hastened-death by hanging. Yet Scroon survived. One after the other, attempts to execute the Nightripper failed-headsmen died of fright as they lifted the axe, guillotines malfunctioned, magic failed. Each botched execution left Scroon more disfigured, but his legend grew. The 13th and final execution put the man down once and for all-or so it was hoped. Scroon's soul went to the Boneyard, where something amazing happened-he passed through to the Abyss with his mind and memories intact. So remarkable was his retention of his identity that it drew the attention of Lamashtu herself, who pulled the killer's soul from the shuddersome bosom of the Abyss and made him her personal assassin, raising him from a broken shell of a soul to a nascent demon lord with greater power than he'd ever hoped for in life. His form had changed, transforming into a shape more befitting one of his horrific nature, yet his mind remained sharp and clear. Nightripper harbors a strong desire for revenge, but for now he serves dutifully as Lamashtu's favored torturer and assassin and as the lord of the dungeons below her palace in the Abyssal realm of Kurnugia. But it is said that someday, when he has repaid his debt to the Mother of Demons for his ascension and rescue from the dregs of the Abyss, the Nightripper will return to his old haunts. Only this time, it will not be individuals he breaks and bleeds and buries in his pits-it will be entire cities.",819200

Despite their nature, nightshades only rarely interact with mortal cultists of Abyssal lords or archdaemons of similar mien, such as Nocticula, Orcus, Charon, and Trelmarixian. This fact owes more to the rarity of interactions between nightshades and fiends in general- despite nightshades' own fiendish origins-as they are relatively isolated from the Abyss and Abbadon, and prey on those planes' residents as willingly as on those of the Material Plane.",19200

This is not to say that the nightwalker never sacrifices its troops to gain a tactical advantage-just that these attacks are the only ones the monster feels no urge to participate in directly.

These nightshades are also the most likely to be found serving a non-undead master-nightwings are often used by powerful mortals as guardians or sentinels. Despite this, nightwings still hope to someday slay master they serve. They enter servitude primarily as a method of aiding a destructive or murderous mortal in their task of mass murder; once this task is over, or if at point the nightwing believes its master is slacking in its murderous duties, the nightwing is swift to turn on its one-time ally. A nightwing found on the Material Plane not in the employ of a more powerful master is typically encountered in rugged terrain where there are numerous locations that can provide shelter when the sun rises.

Nihiloi,11,outsider,any,"A mass of black, bramble-like tentacles writhes from the back of this vague, shifting humanoid. Inky skin covers the creature, and ebon claws curve long and thin from the tips of its fingers. Numerous tendrils of wispy shadow hold the creature aloft while others rise above its shoulders in strange, wriggling wings.","Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared. Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fmountains of dark tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies. Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand. Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues. Ecology Artisans of the Plane of Shadow, with a near-peerless understanding of that realm, nihilois can, like sculptors, twist and manipulate the very fabric of their home plane. Birthed from the dark plane, these natives are as true inhabitants of their realms as the denizens of the Material Plane are of theirs. The ever-changing gloom of the plane permeates these creatures, and they likewise prove dark and changeable. Yet as the nature of shadow is to flee from the light, so too do nihilois find it natural to retreat from interlopers into their realm. Having done so since times unrecorded, only in recent centuries has a new sentiment grown among these shadow lords, a feeling that they are losing an important battle and that both their survival and their realm are threatened. Thus, slowly over the span of centuries, resistance to foreign invaders has gradually become a hallmark of this mysterious race. Nihilois, both male and female, stand nearly 7 feet tall, but often raise themselves up off the ground on coils of their dark tendrils. Those thick bunches of thin limbs that extend from their backs they typically hold together in dense clusters, causing them to appear like wings, but can unravel them and bring them to bear with incredible swiftness. Having a highly malleable form, nihilois are light, weighing an average of 65 pounds. When angered, they can temporarily inflate themselves to appear larger, whipping their tendrils around in a fierce display. In addition to serving as weapons and locomotion, nihiloi tentacles are used to feed as well. When tightly wrapped around or within a meal, the tendrils secrete a digestive acid and absorb nutrients through tiny openings. Habitat & Society Nihilois prove exceedingly rare, most having retreated to the farthest-flung depths of the Plane of Shadow where their numbers have dwindled. With rising frequency, though, mhave shrugged off their race's fear of interlopers and come to lurk in the shadow reflections of cities on the Material Plane. In such eerie metropolises, groups of nihilois form tightly knit cells, with small groups potentially claiming districts as their own or splitting entire shadow cities between themselves. Quick to influence and master lesser shadow creatures-such as shadows, shadow garms, and fetchlings- nihilois can draw surprisingly large populations of shadow creatures to a single location. While large clusters of such beings don't overtly threaten the Material Plane, such is true only so long as the natives of that plane stay within their realm. Those spellcasters who step from their city homes onto the Plane of Shadow might find the land far less desertsed than is typical for the plane, a realm of living shadow and hostile, glowing eyes. Outside such cities or group settings, lone nihilois hunt down interlopers into their realm, shadowing trespassers until the time is right to strike. While slaying such intruders satisfies their need for vengeance, all nihilois also seek out portals leading onto the Plane of Shadow and destroy such passages however they can, striving toward a day when all know to avoid the nighted realm.",12800

With little more organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling teeth. Yet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for their unquiet deaths.

They sometimes use this ability to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast waters breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their presence hidden. They make lairs underwaters, forming small communities if their numbers are great enough. Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a great lakes, but no one has yet confirmed its location. BOG NIXIES In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out. A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced creature template who has the following additional powers. A bog nixie's CR is +2 higher than a normal nixie's. Captivating Song : This works like the harpy ability of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based. Change Shape : This works as polymorph, and allows the bog nixie to assume the form of Small or Medium waters animal or humanoid. Minor Wish : Once per day, a bog nixie can create a magical effect in exchange for a gift or service from a humanoid. The power of this ""wish"" is no greater than what can be done with a 3rd-level spell.",400
Noble Time Elemental,14,outsider,Plane of Time,This creature appears as a formless cloud of yellowish-red vapor or dust about 5 feet in diameter.,"Time elementals are creatures from a plane most sages are unaware even exists. A time elemental is a powerful creature formed of pure time and matter such as is unknown to even the most learned of sages. It is unknown how or why time elementals enter the Material Plane, as they cannot be summoned using the standard summoning spells. Time elementals attack by forming misty or smoky arms from their forms and lashing at opponents or by spraying a fine mist onto their opponents so as to induce aging. Against particularly powerful opponents, a time elemental uses its alter age ability or  summons additional time elementals to its aid.

Nogitsune,7,outsider,urban,"This fox-headed humanoid has a sleek, feminine form that moves with seductive grace. As she steps into a defensive posture, a mass of bushy tails flicks at the air above her back and she reveals teeth flecked with blood.","Nogitsune are created when oni spirits take over the bodies of kitsune . The resultant possession creates a creature with the kitsune's foxlike grace and cunning and infuses it with the destructive power of an oni. Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox's head. A nogitsune's fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. More details on kitsune can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dragon Empires Gazetteer. Ecology Oni manifest themselves in different ways based on the creatures they take as vessels for their depraved wrath. They take particular joy in corrupting kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy, such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics . Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than the ground. Still others claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of waters and disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use to escape pursuit, even when running full speed. Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of inf iltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright  but rather render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery. A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork. Habitat & Society Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the oni in the midst of people who society generally doesn't miss if and when a contract doesn't slakes the creature's bloodlust. Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But mwho foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses. Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other oni, or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conf licted and turbulent anger within the creatures, as if the once-righteous kitsune within a nogitsune constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such a reversal occurring, mbelieve that these malevolent oni drown themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges of the creatures they were before.",3200
Noqual Golem,18,construct,any,"Pale green metal makes up the body of this automaton. Despite its towering size, it moves with lithe quickness.","The construction of a noqual golem requires both a considerable supply of the skiesmetal noqual and the skill to overcome noqual's antipathy to dweomers. The resulting golem resembles an iron golem, but is larger and more nimble. Noqual golems impede magic by their mere presence, and their touch disrupts spells and magical constructs. Nearly all noqual on Golarion lies under Numerian control. The artificers of Numeria prefer tinkering with technological constructs rather than magical ones, but nonetheless Furkas Xoud was believed to have created a noqual golem. Another is thought to serve the sorcerers of Starfall as a fail-safe should their technology prove inadequate.

Normal Spriggan,3,fey,land or underground,"This creature resembles an ugly, stocky gnome with a bulbous nose and reddish eyes. It has a shaggy dark mustache and ratty beard, both unkempt and caked with dirt and filth.","Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting opponents by surprise. Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of black. Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty beards, but head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of their gnomish kinfolk. A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 to 55 pounds. An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs 500 to 550 pounds. Spriggans make the best use of their magical abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in a mob will change size at the start of melee. Spriggan Society Spriggan mobs are almost always comprised of males; female spriggans rarely venture out of their dismal lairs other than to gather food. Mobs of spriggan males are nomadic in nature, roving from place to place and never settling down for more than a few days unless there is promising a opportunity for rewarding raids on local communities. Female spriggan mobs are unusually stable for such chaotic creatures, often lairing in the same place for years before moving on. Spriggan Characters Spriggans have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Mspriggans with class levels choose rogue. Spriggan leaders are usually rogue/fighters or rogue/sorcerers. Spriggan characters possess the following racial traits: -2 Strength, +8 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma. Spriggans are extremely quick and elusive in their normal form but hardy as well. Small size: Spriggans are Small and have the following adjustments +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus on Stealth checks, -1 penalty to CMB/CMD, lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters. Base speed: A spriggan's base land speed is 20 feet. Low-light vision: Spriggans can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Racial Hit Dice: A spriggan begins with five levels of fey, which provide 5d6 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.

Norn,18,fey,cold mountains,"This towering, stern woman wears her long blonde hair in braids. She carries a reel of golden thread and a pair of shears.","Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to discourage this veneration. A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.",153600
Nosoi,2,outsider,any,"Perched awkwardly, this strange songbird stares with a glint of intellect in its empty eyes. A stylish plaster mask conceals its face, while two pairs of wings ruff le over its body's somber shades.","Nosois eagerly fill the roles of clerks, scribes, and messengers in the bureaucracy of the hereafter. Flitting through the winding halls of Pharasma's realm, they record the circumstances of each mortal's death, judgments for and against its soul, and its final destination along the Outer Planes. Their efforts alone maintain the immense Catalogue of Last Days-the Boneyard's infinite library of precedent. But unlike more tireless, mechanical outsiders, nosois are also prone to powerful whims, boasting contests, and petty theft. Mortals recognize nosois in their roles as messengers, counselors of troubled or disbelieving dead, and guides along the rivers of Souls, and some ancient texts refer to them as scribe psychopomps, death's messengers, and yanakeion. Mlarge and well-tended graveyards or catacombs play host to a nosoi who tends to the newly passed and keeps a watchful eye out for the looming taint of undeath. Nosois' bodies take the form of mortal songbirds- usually crows, sparrows, and especially whippoorwills- though like all other psychopomps they wear graceful, elegant funerary masks that accentuate their sharp beaks and empty eyes. Malso craft decorative artificial tails from small bric-a-brac that trail behind them as they soar through the Boneyard. Nosois are typically measure about 1 foot in length, though their tails may double or triple that length. They are deceptively heavy, weighing between 10 and 15 pounds. Ecology Nosois serve within the libraries and scriptoriums of Pharasma's realm, tirelessly scribbling away without rest. Being social creatures, however, they frequently chatter with one another-boasting of past deeds, arguing over notation, and exchanging gossip from the far corners of creation. The immortal creatures toil for centuries before ascending to become higher psychopomps or, more likely, reincarnating on the mortal world. Though outsiders have no need to eat, nosois consider doing so a rare treat. Their frequent sojourns to the Material Plane and mOuter Planes involve frequent snacks and tastings. Being dutiful but not unwavering, nosois sometimes succumb to bribes and share the information they possess, and mortal treats loosen their secrets far faster than gold or magic. Nosois exist primarily atop Pharasma's Spire, in and around the Palace of Death, but they travel more frequently than other psychopomps. While on the Material Plane, they either use their natural invisibility to hide, or else assume the forms of songbirds , which they exploit to gather their favorite treats: breads and sweets. Mfalse superstitions claim that a captured nosoi can be forced to restore a fallen lover to life, and the outsiders remain wary of the living as a result. Habitat & Society The primary duty of nosois is to record happenings within Pharasma's realm in meticulous detail, as well as to conduct souls to and from their appointed destinations. Malso serve as assistants to more powerful psychopomps or even to mortals with particularly morbid concerns or fates that the goddess of death wishes to keep watch on. Despite being the smallest and least inf luential of their breed, nosois take pride in knowing that their trivial tasks aid in keeping one of the multiverse's most important aspects functioning with general reliability. Nosois also serve as the bureaucracy of death's messengers to the other Outer Planes, carrying missives from the depths of the Abyss to the summit of Heaven-wherever other outsiders argue over the fate of mortal souls. The Boneyard's abundant portals eliminate need for dimension-hopping magic, and with the exception of some fiends, most outsiders respect the couriers' neutrality and allow them safe passage. Typical nosois are gregarious, eager to please, and hardworking, though easily distracted and prone to taking frequent breaks. Perhaps because of their frequent contact with the newly dead, nosois are easier for humanoids to relate to than are other kinds of psychopomps. Like humanoids, they maintain their neutrality not through an obsessive adherence to balance, but rather through a combination of dedication to their duty playing against interest in their own aims. History and mythology are rife with stories of individuals who have exploited such personal interests. Most cultures on Golarion tell tall tales of mortals cheating death at games of cards or in other contests with nosois. While in actuality nosois lack the power to restore the dead to life, desperate petitioners occasionally slip away from the scribe psychopomps, or else win days of freedom in games of chance, allowing the petitioners to brief ly visit loved ones or complete important tasks. Each nosoi varies in its willingness to play with its charges or gamble away its secrets, but most will concede to a few hours' distraction, with or without a prize. Bizarrely musical, nosois provide a requiem that echoes through msites in the Boneyard, lending a comforting presence to the otherwise grandiose and imposing structure. Their steady quill scratching sets a constant beat, their competing, haunting songs fill out the musical score, and their tittering gossip punctuates every corner. To those who frequent the Boneyard, the tone of the courts can be quickly and easily gauged by the quality of this ambient music. Journeying to the Material Plane to counsel or escort the dead is considered an honor, and a nosoi's confidence and position among its peers revolve around these monotonybreaking assignments. They regularly filch grave goods from mortal ceremonies, especially ribbons, flowers, and beads, all of which they use to craft and expand beautiful artificial tails. Only nosois with allies among the higher courts boast more than a dozen such trophies, and such blessed individuals often use their trophies as bribes and rewards among those with whom they have dealings. Some even believe mortals share their sense of value, and most promises of great rewards from nosois culminate in little more than useless trash. Nosoi Familiars Nosois sometimes depart from their service to the bureaucracy of death to act as familiars to spellcasters with a special connection to or interest in death. Most relish the opportunity, and make useful assistants to spellcasters who keep extensive libraries or prefer meticulous records. They can be troublesome, though, given their natural curiosity and tendency to steal small objects. Any neutral caster of 7th level or higher and who has the Improved Familiar feat may summon a nosoi. Nosois often use their skill as scribes to aid their mortal masters. Despite their size and apparent lack of hands, they may use medium-sized drawing and writing tools without penalty. They grant their masters a +2 bonus on skill checks made to scribe scrolls. Like all psychopomps, nosois loathe the undead. They immediately leave the service of master who creates or permanently becomes such an abomination.",600
Nothosaur,5,animal,waters,"This long-necked reptile swims through the waters propelled by four paddle-like feet, whipping a long and slender tail behind it as it gnashes its sharp, needle-like teeth.","The nothosaur resembles a smaller version of the land-based brachiosaurus, sharing the distinctive long neck and tail and short legs of its herbivorous brethren. Nothosaurs are also similar in mways to seals-they spend much of their time in the waters, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is most vulnerable out of the waters, but when caught unawares, it can return to the waters with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in waters of temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of mmonths. From head to the tip of its tail, an adult nothosaur is 12 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.",1600
Nuckalavee,9,aberration,temperate forests,"A large skinless warhorse ridden by a similarly skinless rider approaches. As it nears, one can clearly see the rider growing straight out of the creature's back. The monster's internal organs, veins that carry its blackened blood, and corded muscles are all easily seen by one viewing the creature. A thin layer of reddish mucus covering its body gives off a putrid odor. Its eyes are stark white, while those of the rider are a hellish red. Its body is hairless save for its bushy, matted, and bloodstained horse-like tail.","An evil woodland creature that hates most other life is a good description of the nuckalavee. An evil woodland creature that kills all that cross its path, eats their flesh, and drinks their liquefied organs is an even better description of the nuckalavee. Nuckalavee are fearsome, aggressive combatants that relish the savagery and butchery of melee combat. The true origin of the nuckalavee is shrouded in mystery and has been lost over time. Some believe it to be the offspring of a demon or devil and a female centaur. Others say the nuckalavee is the result of a curse placed upon a tribe of centaurs centuries ago by a mad and evil sorcerer. Whatever their origin, the nuckalavee is a deadly opponent, capable of felling even the mightiest of warriors. Nuckalavee sustain themselves on a diet of flesh, blood, and liquefied organs. They digest no other foods or liquids . Prey is often captured or killed and dragged back to its lair where it is devoured. The typical nuckalavee lair is a crude structure formed of dirt, mud, and foliage. Contents range from bones, to rotting organs and flesh, to the treasure of those it has dragged back to its lair to feed upon. Often a lair contains a female and 1d2 young. Young nuckalavee resemble adults in all aspects, save they are smaller in size. Nuckalavee relish the adrenaline of combat. They love the taste, sight, and smell of blood and seek to bleed their opponents as often and as much as they can. The ""rider"" always employs a bladed weapon  to deal damage, while the equine part of the nuckalavee slashes with its sharpened hoofs and bites with its razorsharp teeth. The nuckalavee opens combat with its poisonous breath, seeking to liquefy the organs of its foes before it moves to strike with hooves, bite, and weapon. They rarely attack from ambush, relishing in the fear their appearance strikes in the heart of opponents. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",6400
Nuckelavee,9,fey,cold swamps or coastlines,"This skinless creature resembles a horse and its humanoid rider, fused into a single hideous being of rage and sickness.","The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and filth, be it the natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive pollution of sewage and other urban waste. A nuckelavee is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a spreader of corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources that bring corruption into the world. The corruption spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers, swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little more than watching their enemies sicken and die. Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawaters-or of prayers to recite to ward away nuckelavees or convince them the bearer is innocent. In truth, however, these old solutions offer no protection from the vile plague-bearers. A nuckelavee is the same size as a horse.",6400
Nue,10,magical beast,warm forests or mountains,"Materializing out of a noxious black cloud, this beast has the head of a fanged monkey and the body of a tiger with a viper as a tail.","This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a fanged monkey, and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though some call it a chimera and treat it as an exotic specimen of that creature, it is a completely different breed of beast. Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting terror upon its prey, a nue delights in toying with its victim before dealing the killing blow. Often, a nue will select a target and plague it with nightmares before it even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim with dreadful dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once its prey is thoroughly exhausted, the nue will finally steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting its prey with both disease and poison, letting the victim writhe in pain before succumbing to death. A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only made eerier by its ability to turn into an inky cloud of darkness. In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is. By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black cloud, its prey is often too fatigued from its strange night terrors to defend itself. The dreams a nue impregnates creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice. Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children warped into twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion, and fear among former friends and family. According to these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a once-strong and proud target that has been brought low by its debilitating attacks. A nue is 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.",9600
Nuglub,2,fey,underground or urban,"This hideous, hunchbacked creature has three glowing blue eyes. Oily hair grows from its head and back, covering it like a cloak.","Nuglub gremlins are deranged; they enjoy combat with a manic glee that other gremlins reserve for destroying devices or creating complex traps. Indeed, they spend long hours sharpening their claws, filing their teeth, and looking for the perfect ledge from which to leap into the fray. If combat doesn't come to them, they seek it out, entering villages and killing innocents by night. Their idea of a good time is murder so silent that the victim never wakes up, so the family members find the remains the next morning and accuse one another of the atrocity. Nuglubs jealously attack armored foes, as the gremlins' hunchbacked forms make it difficult to wear armor made for other humanoids. A group may use its heat metal and shocking grasp abilities to weaken an opponent before mobbing it and trying to knock the foe prone. As soon as an enemy falls to the ground, all nuglubs descend on that target in a frenzy of bloodlust, grappling and biting, holding on like perverse leeches until nothing remains. Though less technically inclined than some of their kin, nuglubs like using traps. Unlike most gremlins, who prefer to sabotage existing machines, nuglubs delight in the stealthy construction of traps in areas their victims consider familiar, rigging these painful and often deadly surprises on front doors, around the floor of beds, or near cribs in nurseries. Nuglubs are the brutes of gremlin-kind. Groups of nuglubs remain small, as they tend to quarrel with each other and cannibalize those on the wrong side of an angry argument. Lone nuglubs often work with other gremlins, as they like proving they're the strongest, and aren't likely to kill and eat their smaller allies . Nuglubs typically stand 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 25 pounds.",600

Nyogoth,10,outsider,any,This appears to be a mass of floating intestines tangled around a fanged mouth-the tips of its coils also end in toothy maws.,"The nyogoth's role on the Abyss is that of a scavenger.

Despite their seemingly lowly role in Abyssal ecosystems, the nyogoths are far from stupid beasts. Most are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and are capable of solving relatively complex problems when it comes to securing the next meal. As outsiders, nyogoths do not need to eat to survive, yet this does not exempt them from hunger-a nyogoth that goes for longer than 12 hours without a meal becomes increasingly violent and erratic. Such a ""starving"" nyogoth typically fights to the death when the prospect of food is available, and may even resort to self-cannibalism, drinking its own spurting digestive juices from its wounds in a nauseating display.

Whatever their origin, nysrocks are thoroughly evil and contemptible caring for no one other than themselves. Nysrocks are often found in the courts of various demon lords serving as advisors and counselors. Their cunning intellects are used to full effect by their masters in weaving battle plans and plots and intrigues against rival lords and enemies. Rumors abound as of late  of an abyssal plane ruled by a massive nysrock at least 40 feet long. Its palace is a network of underground tunnels populated with all manner of snakes, fiendish serpents, and intelligent and cunning reptiles of all shapes and sizes. A nysrock ranges in size from 14 to 16 feet long and weigh 350 to 450 pounds. Its scales are blackish-blue and its eyes are golden and glint with a cunning spark. Its barbed tail is jet black and oozes a vile smelling poison when the creature is threatened. A nysrock flares its hood before it enters combat as a warning to its opponents. Those that press combat are met with a vicious bite and venomous tail sting. A creature that is bitten is grabbed and wrapped in the monster's coils. A nysrock derives great pleasure in repeatedly stinging a grappled foe. Once a grappled foe expires, the nysrock releases its hold and consumes it whole so long as it faces no more enemies .

Some say that the grumpy old oakmen are the male versions of the beautiful dryads. This may or may not be true, but it would certainly explain why dryads would rather take human mates. Oakmen are generally content to sit in their trees and watch the world go by, venturing out only if their forests is threatened. They also enjoy creeping out of the forests to trick some fool human into eating magical cakes made from moss and mushrooms just to see what will happen to him. Oakmen are scrappy and prone to combat despite their small size. They willingly fight if they must, but, like most fey, prefer to use magic rather than melee.

Obambo,13,undead,warm forests,"This spectral creature looks like a scarred and shriveled ruin of an ancient tribal elder, with skin caked with dirt and moss, and long white hair tangled with sticks. Sharp teeth fill its cackling mouth, and its eyes are tiny but bright and piercing. junglesvines weave through its ghostly body, which appears stuffed with decaying leaves and other plant matter.","When a person wise in the lore of the junglesdies and is not buried or given a funeral, the junglesitself may embrace her spirit, creating an obambo . The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of plants, and the crawling things beneath, becoming one with the junglesitself. An obambo is cunning, spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo is dangerous, they are known to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the obambo's price. Ecology An obambo may rise when a tribal elder or shaman perishes in the wild and is never properly laid to rest. Without the proper rites to lead the spirit into the afterlife, the obambo is lost and sundered from its community and tribe, cursed to wander the wild. If the obambo's place of death can be discovered and its remains returned for proper burial , its spirit is laid to rest forever, but few obambos ever find such peace. Instead, whispered memories drive the obambo to meander endlessly between junglesvillages, all vaguely familiar but none ever seeming right. An obambo may be male or female. Obambos are solitary wanderers of the bush and veldt. Animals shy away from them, but obambos share a keen spiritual symbiosis with vermin and plants. Through an obambo's journeys, these are its audience, attending faithfully to the obambo's endless tales and treating it as a wise mentor and leader. Their obeisance, however, can never satisfy the obambo's yearning for the rapt attention of its former humanoid kind to its riddles, stories, and lessons. An obambo is easily angered by the foolish, however, and its stern reproofs often leave its pupils as drooling husks or mindless insectile drones. An obambo's plant or vermin sycophants have been known to devour such hapless wretches, or even to ravage entire villages as they sit enthralled by the obambo's tales. As long as a few survivors remain and learn from the obambo's teaching, it is satisfied. In case, an angry obambo hardly needs assistance in the act of destruction, as an obambo's spiritual communion with the land enables it to merge itself into the land, rising up as a roaring titan melded of soil, mud, vegetation, and crawling vermin. Habitat and Society Obambos often establish a reputation as darkling oracles, wise and knowledgeable about the jungles, its creatures, and its people. They create small shrines to themselves called akinfa, usually in hollow trees where supplicants may bring gifts and the obambo may sit within. These gifts may be of material wealth, but as a teacher, the obambo prefers gifts that show the talents of the supplicant, be it a crafted item, a song, a story, a riddle, or some other performance. An obambo begins meeting as unfriendly, but a supplicant may make a Craft or Perform check opposed by the obambo's Appraise skill to offer a gift he has made . If the supplicant succeeds, the obambo is impressed with his skill and its attitude becomes indifferent. If the check fails, the obambo remains unfriendly, and if failed by 10 or more, the obambo is insulted and becomes hostile. If a creature offers an item the creature did not personally create, the obambo is entitled to a Sense Motive check opposed by the supplicant's Craft or Perform check; if it succeeds, the obambo becomes hostile. An obambo is unaffected by Diplomacy until it receives a suitable gift. An indifferent obambo's attitude may be improved with Diplomacy or by offering additional gifts as above; each gift that pleases the obambo improves its attitude by one step. Using Intimidate against the obambo makes it immediately hostile, as does unsuccessful Bluff attempt. An obambo can also be challenged to a storytelling contest. The contest is resolved by a Perform  or Perform  check opposed by the obambo's Perform  check; if the PC wins, the obambo is truly impressed and immediately becomes helpful. Each time a supplicant tries to inf luence the obambo's attitude beyond indifferent, it responds with a question or riddle, using its Bluff skill or one of its Knowledge skills; the supplicant must oppose the check with the same skill. Each time a supplicant fails this opposed check, the obambo becomes annoyed and all skill checks to inf luence him take a -2 circumstance penalty for 1 hour. An indifferent obambo answers questions in riddles, requiring a Sense Motive check opposed by the obambo's Bluff check for the PC to understand what the creature means. A friendly obambo speaks more plainly, and visitors generally do not need to make opposed checks to determine its meaning. It may offer goodberries to supplicants who have offered it additional gifts. A helpful obambo answers questions clearly, and may also agree to use one of its spell-like abilities to aid the supplicant. However, an obambo expects gratitude and an additional gift after it lends its aid. If no gift is forthcoming, or the supplicant requests another favor, the obambo flies into a rage at the ingratitude and attacks.",25600
Obcisidaemon,19,outsider,any,"This massive fiend has thick claws like a lion's, the broad wings of an eagle, and the legs of a massive canine. Its face is that of a three-eyed wolf with the jaws of a saber-toothed tiger. While two of the thing's eye sockets are merely empty holes that trickle blood, the middle eye glows a sickly yellow. A cloud of globular soul-stuff cloaks the creature's hulking body, bits dripping loosely from its barbwire-covered arms.","The obcisidaemon personifies the darkest elements of war. Obcisidaemons strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory, leaving only the brutal and violent pragmatism at its core, and then divest it of humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Ref lecting the disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave only wastelands of rubble and ashes in their wake. Where an obcisidaemon walks, not even the ghosts of the dead remain to lament the destruction, for the daemon wipes out not only innocent individuals, but also their entire histories and bloodlines, ensuring that no future exists for its victims in sense of the word. Obcisidaemons stand 25 feet tall, have a wingspan of 30 feet, and weigh over 15,000 pounds. Ecology When a mortal commits a true act of genocide in life and goes to Abaddon in death, it has a chance of forming into an obcisidaemon if it survives long enough as a member of the hunted. Such individuals rarely have trouble managing the unforgiving wastes, as they are willing to destroy and all possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an impossibility and solitude an inevitability. This vicious soul eventually develops into an obcisidaemon-a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare stand in its path. In life, the soul of an obcisidaemon perhaps only desired to kill a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the being seeks the obliteration of all mortals. Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to drip from its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities that provides onlookers an idea as to the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on all of the souls at once, instead capturing victims for later use. When the fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant population, it consumes its reserve souls in order to strengthen its powers and ensure its success in total annihilation. Habitat & Society Devoted to the wanton, systematic slaughter of mortals, most obcisidaemons serve Szuriel, the Horseman of War, who shares similar ideals. In her service, an obcisidaemon functions as a high-ranking officer at the head of an army of purrodaemons, so skilled are the harbingers of genocide at managing the pragmatic art of organized massacres. Sometimes, an amassed group of obcisidaemons instead trails behind an invading daemonic army, so as to ensure that no trace of the butchered mortals remains but ashes and salted earth. Obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that the land is thereafter uninhabitable by other creatures as well. Occasionally, an obcisidaemon serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons, sowing disease and clouds of poison across miles of terrain in its passing. Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four, instead choosing to function as independent agents of genocide. These beings wander from plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane, hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere mortal could control their awesome power. Most such summoners end up among the first souls devoured and consumed into the cloud of tormented spirits that cloaks the now-rampaging obcisidaemon.",204800
Obsidian Minotaur,9,construct,any,"This creature appears as a powerfully constructed minotaur, twice the size of a normal human, and carved of obsidian. Its hands end in slightly oversized claws and its feet are splayed hooves. Small pinpoints of bluish light can be seen in its eyes.","The obsidian minotaur is often employed by spellcasters as a guardian or killer and can be found performing such tasks. When employed as an assassin, the obsidian minotaur is quite effective, first striking fear into the heart of its opponent and then slaying it with no thought or consequence. An obsidian minotaur stands 12 feet tall and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds. As a guardian, the obsidian minotaur activates when trespassers enter an area it is programmed to protect. As an assassin, it actively hunts down the targeted victim. The creature attacks with its powerful claws, slashing and ripping its opponent's flesh.

Ochre Eurypterid,0.33,vermin,warm oceans,"Two large pincers grasp at the air before this sleek creature, while a finned tail bristling with a long, thin stinger rises from behind.","Known to some as sea scorpions, eurypterids are waters crustaceans that blur the line between their terrestrial cousins and lobsters. Primeval and voracious, these vermin range in size from relatively harmless ochre eurypterids the size of a dog up to the truly immense spitting eurypterids. There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whaleeating eurypterids by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common-an aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of waters indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",135
Ochre Jelly,5,ooze,temperate underground or marshes,"This yellow-orange amoeboid creature slithers across the ground, pseudopods grasping ahead of its slow approach.","Ochre jellies are animate masses of protoplasm hued a sickly combination of yellow, orange, and brown. At rest, their flat, pulsing bodies stand roughly 6 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter- in motion, they often ball up into quivering spherical shapes and almost seem to roll as they move. Their malleable bodies allow them to seep through cracks and holes far smaller than the space they fill. Creatures dwelling below ground often attempt to seal up such cracks to fortify their lairs against ochre jellies. An ochre jelly's highly specialized acid only dissolves flesh. This discovery has led mpoisoners and hack alchemists to search out specimens for their tinkering. Some specialized weapons have resulted from these experiments that target the living body in wicked ways. Rumors of a slow-release poison that breaks down the cellular walls in living creatures surfaced a few years ago, but its creator guards the secret with his life. Notes in a long-forgotten tome mention a burial practice used in faraway places that resembles cremation. Instead of burning the corpse to ashes, the practitioners seal the body into a stone sarcophagus with an ochre jelly so it can dissolve the body. Afterward, the morticians place the ochre jelly into a large canopic jar, complete with a bronze plaque naming the deceased. This practice protects items entombed with the body , and the creature's essence, it is believed, still rides along with the living jelly. Ochre jellies stand about 6 inches tall, spread out to a little over 10 feet in diameter, and weigh upward of 2,600 pounds. When in combat, they tend to pile up upon themselves and exude long, dripping pseudopods to slam and grapple anything that moves. Although the typical ochre jelly has stats as presented here, in the deepest reaches of the underground world these mindless predators can grow to enormous sizes. Perhaps more disturbing, though, are rumors of ochre jellies that have developed additional methods of capturing prey. Adventurers speak of jellies capable of poisoning foes with a touch or exuding clouds of noxious gas that burns the eyes and throat, leaving those who draw too near helpless as the immense protoplasmic beast slithers over their bodies and begins to feed.",1600

Ogre,3,humanoid,temperate or cold hills,"This lumbering giant's beady eyes are devoid of wit or kindness, and its puffy face features a wide mouth with ill-fitting teeth.","Stories are told of ogres-horrendous stories of brutality and savagery, cannibalism and torture. Of rape and dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and all manners of hideous murder. Those who have not encountered ogres know the stories as warnings. Those who have survived such encounters know these tales to be tame compared to the truth. An ogre revels in the misery of others. When smaller races aren't available to crush between meaty fists or defile in blood-red lusts of violence, they turn to each other for entertainment. Nothing is taboo in ogre society. One would think that, left to themselves, an ogre tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only the strongest surviving in the end-yet if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family. Ogre tribes are known as families, and mof their deformities and hideous features arise from the common practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. Ogre tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of gathering multiple families under his command. Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live in harmony with their environment. The borderland between civilization and ogre territory is a desperate realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the ogrekin, the deformed offspring and results of frequent ogre raids against the lands of the smaller folk. Ogre games are violent and cruel, and victims they use for entertainment are lucky if they die the first day. Ogres' cruel senses of humor are the only way their crude minds show spark of creativity, and the tools and methods of torture ogres devise are always nightmarish. An ogre's great strength and lack of imagination makes it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants  often subjugate ogre families to serve them in such regards. A typical adult ogre stands 10 feet tall and weighs roughly 650 pounds.",800
Ogre Mage,8,outsider,cold hills,"Clad in beautiful armor, this exotically garbed giant roars, its tusks glistening and its eyes afire with murderous intent.","The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh-in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask. Oni Traits The oni are a diverse race of evil outsiders, of which the ogre mage is the most common. Other types of oni exist as well-evil spirits that clothe themselves in the flesh of other types of humanoid. The majority of oni are giants, with goblinoid, tengu, and reptilian oni being relatively common as well. While oni are incredibly varied in their shapes and powers, they still share certain traits in common. • Regeneration: All oni regenerate, although the rate of regeneration varies. Damage from fire or acid can kill an oni. • Change Shape: All oni are shapechangers, but their ability to change shape is generally limited to creatures similar in shape to their true form. • Native: Oni are native outsiders. As evil spirits clad in mortal humanoid flesh, all oni also possess one of the humanoid subtypes-usually giant.",4800

Ogren,1,humanoid,temperate hills or plains,"This humanoid stands over seven feet tall, its features an amalgam of goblin and ogre. Coarse brown hair covers its sickly yellowish hide, though its hideous face remains entirely hairless, except for the long, knotted tangle of greasy hair spilling from its head. It stares coldly with deep-set eyes the color of pitch.","Take the worst traits of a male ogre and the worst traits of a female hobgoblin and mix them together, the result is an ogren: a barbaric and primitive race of individuals that see combat as a way of life and means of entertainment and survival. Combat skills and battle prowess are taught at a very young age among the ogren clans, and it is not unheard of for an entire clan to be led by one who, by other race would be considered a child, for the mighty rule the weak and the strongest and most combative ogren usually rules a clan. Ogren leaders often have the Battle Shout feat detailed in the sidebar. Ogrens pride themselves on combat and employ varying tactics and strategies when engaged in such affairs. Ogrens prefer straightforward tactics to ambush and chicanery, though if outmatched, they are not above employing such tactics. Ogrens usually use gang tactics in battle and prefer unmatched odds where they clearly have the upper hand . Ogrens rarely if ever back down from a fight as they are taught that cowardice is equal to weakness. However, they are also taught that it is foolish to fight while your enemy clearly has the advantage and backing away is ok, so long as the odds are made even  the next time the two meet. Ogrens appear as 6-to-8-foot tall stocky humanoids with hairy hides of dark brown, yellowish-brown, or gray. Their eyes are generally gray or black, though some do have green or blue eyes . Hair color ranges from brown or black to dark red or gray. Most ogren have long hair and rarely if ever sport facial hair. The typical ogren lives to 100 years of age. Ogren Society Being a primitive people, the ogren clans survive by hunting game and gathering wild fruits, berries, and herbs. Most hunting bands consist of 3-5 males and a tracker . Ogrens typically hunt large game such as moose, deer, buffalo, bison, elk, humans, and elves. Ma hunting foray has led a band of ogrens into a human or elven encampment or settlement. During these raids, targets are often taken alive and carried back to the ogren's lair where they are stored in cages for later consumption. Ogren often fatten up captive humans and elves before eating them . In times when food is scarce, some clans resort to cannibalism and hunt their own . Ogren clans are found just about anywhere save the coldest of climates, though they tend to favor temperate climates. Food is hard to come by in such harsh extremes, so they prefer moderate to warm climates where a food supply is readily available. A typical ogren settlement consists of crude huts constructed of wood with thatched or wooden roofs. The huts are spread in a circle around a central meeting ground where they dance, engage in combat, cook their food, and hold yearly rituals. Each clan typically holds three or more yearly rituals. Some ogren rituals include the Rites of Manhood, The Taking , and The Passing . During the rites of manhood, a young ogren must display his battle prowess against a member of his clan. These fights are never to the death, but the damage dealt is real. Mogren proudly display the scars of such fights on their bodies. During The Taking, a male ogren selects a bride from another clan as a mate. The shaman from the male's clan oversees the ceremony and blesses such a union, usually through the ritual sacrifice of a captive human or elf . The last ritual, The Passing, is led by the shaman and consists of the shaman invoking the spirits of dead ancestors to watch over recently slain or deceased ogrens. Ogren Characters Strength +6, Constitution +4, Charisma -2. Ogren leaders tend to be barbarians. Ogren clerics are usually adepts and are known as shamans among their clans.

Ogrillon,1,humanoid,land or underground,"This ugly brute appears to be a mix of ogre and perhaps orc. Its skin is covered in closely fitting bony plates and nodes akin to an alligator. Its hair is greasy, ragged, and generally unkempt. It exudes a strong sour odor from its body.","Ogrillons are a fierce half-ogre race born of a union between a female orc and a male ogre. They tend to act like ogres, but they are far more violent and aggressive than their larger kin. Ogrillons are usually only slightly taller than orcs, with features that strongly favor their orc parent - so much so that most ogrillons are indiscernible from normal orcs. About 10% of ogrillons resemble their ogre parent, however. Ogrillons love nothing more than combat. They are a race so inborn to be warriors that they seem almost depressed and dejected when they are not involved in melee. They only time an ogrillon laughs is when it is the center of a whirlwind of melee and covered in its opponent's blood. Ogrillons do not care for armor or weapons and in fact carry very little gear at all. They do, however, like gold pieces and usually keep a few in a filthy pouch with other shiny trinkets as lucky charms. Ogrillons disdain the use of armor, relying solely on their natural armor to protect them. They also disdain the use of weapons, preferring to leap headlong into a fray with fists swinging madly. Ogrillon Society Ogrillons have no society to call their own. Since they are born of female orcs, ogrillon children are generally raised in orc clans. Their size, strength, and ferocity are welcomed by the orcs, and ogrillons usually occupy a place of reverence in an orc clan. Ogrillons, of course, think little of the admiration of their orc kin. Battle is the only thought that regularly enters the ogrillon mind. Ogrillon Characters Ogrillons have racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Most ogrillon leaders are barbarians.

Olethrodaemon,20,outsider,any,"Crowned with a wicked array of twisted horns, this wide-mouthed, spherical behemoth stands on four stout legs.","While some of the more powerful daemons are servitors to one of the Four Horsemen, olethrodaemons serve as juggernauts for all of the Four. These massive creatures are the embodiment of death and destruction-the very vessels of apocalypse that daemons wish to see wrought upon the multiverse. These nihilistic behemoths roam the gray expanses of Abaddon, feasting on the souls of evil mortals damned to their realm. When on the Material Plane, olethrodaemons act as agents of destruction, spreading ruin and devouring mortal souls as they plow through cities and countrysides, bent on devastation. It's rare for a mortal to be able to control such a potent force, but sometimes mad spellcasters utilize effects like gate to urge an olethrodaemon to visit a devastating holocaust upon an enemy region-the olethrodaemon generally does not hold a grudge against a mortal that asks such a service from it. These immense creatures stand over 25 feet tall and weigh close to 12,000 pounds, their powerful, muscular bodies covered by durable plates and head thronged with dangerous, twisted horns. Olethrodaemons stand on four stout legs, and possess an equal number of arms, each ending in wickedly sharp claws able to tear through stone as easily as flesh. The creature's eyes, as well as its two mouths, glow like coals in a kiln. The creature feeds on souls and has multiple stomachs to digest mortal essences. While not as intelligent or scheming as mother powerful daemons , olethrodaemons remain dangerous foes. They do not generally wish to lead armies and gain power by control, but rather to revel in the evil purity of annihilation. Among olethrodaemons, the greatest desire is to be the one to devour the very last mortal soul. They angle and shove for this honor, often ceding a city or group of victims to a rival if they believe that, in so doing, they might gain the advantage of positioning to consume the final soul once the multiverse has been devoured. OLETHRODAEMON PARAGONS Just as powerful balors become lords and pit fiends clamor for positions as infernal dukes, olethrodaemons can achieve a unique level of power among their kin. These creatures are known as paragons, and gain this level of power by pledging their loyalty to one of the Four Horsemen as a chosen agent of apocalypse. These advanced olethrodaemons specialize in their patron's particular method of annihilation, their abilities evolving to suit the method of ruin. An olethrodaemon paragon generally has from 4 to 8 additional Hit Dice, and is usually a CR 22 to CR 24 creature. Some planar scholars postulate that olethrodaemons are actually the creations of the Four Horsemen, and that the Four worked foul rites upon a fifth Horseman, with these interactions spawning olethrodaemons to serve their will and spread oblivion throughout the multiverse. The abilities of these chosen spawn warp to the tendencies of their daemonic lords. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Pestilence can infect their victims with a powerful disease by means of all their natural attacks. Creatures who succumb to this attack are affected as if by a maximized contagion spell, heightened to 9th level. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of War can imbue their natural attacks with additional properties. As a free action, an olethrodaemon can apply special weapon property equivalent to a +2 enhancement to its bite, claw, gore, or trample attacks for 1 round-most of these olethrodaemon paragons elect to grant their natural weapons the unholy enhancement. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Famine gain the consumptive aura ability of the meladaemon, but the nonlethal damage dealt increases to 6d6 and victims who succumb become exhausted rather than merely fatigued. Olethrodaemons serving the Horseman of Death gain the ability to inf lict a negative level on a foe each time they strike with a claw attack, or else gain the ability to cause those they damage to age rapidly and grow old and frail with hideous speed.",307200
Oliphant,6,animal,cold plains,This massive creature resembles a woolly mastodon with two large downward curving tusks. It appears to be at least 20 feet long or more.,"The oliphant is a 20-foot long creature resembling a mastodon. It is omnivorous and rarely makes its home near civilized or settled areas. Each of the creature's tusks, if wholly pried from a dead oliphant, brings 400 gp on the market. The oliphant's fur is thick, brown, and aids in protecting it from cooler climates and precipitation. Oliphants are sometimes trained as mounts or beasts of burden by various humanoid races. Oliphants seem to understand Common, but they do not speak it. An oliphant attacks with its downward curving tusks and heavy forelegs; its trunk is too short to be used as an effective weapon. Training an Oliphant An oliphant requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, an oliphant must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly oliphant requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding an oliphant does not require an exotic saddle. An oliphant can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Oliphant young are worth 2,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train an oliphant. Carrying Capacity: A light load for an oliphant is up to 2,400 pounds; a medium load, 2,401-4,800 pounds; and a heavy load, 4,801-7,200 pounds. An oliphant can drag 36,000 pounds.

Oma,16,magical beast,vacuum or gaseous giants,"This amorphous, whalelike creature floats ponderously, arcs of brilliant energy filling its mouth and rolling down its body.","The titanic oma, sometimes referred to as ""space whales,"" are some of the largest creatures spawned by the gas giant worlds. Capable of soaring through both dense gas and the vast gulfs between planets by means of magically projected electromagnetic fields, these docile beasts skim planetary atmospheres or trawl the rings of dust and ice surrounding some worlds, singing their crooning telepathic songs across great distances. Despite their size, oma are capable of feeding on even the smallest of prey, straining out life-sustaining molecules such as hydrogen with the electromagnetic fields in their energy baleen. When larger creatures or objects get in their way, however, oma are perfectly happy to swallow them as well. Anything ingested by the creatures in this fashion is blasted by electrical energy, dissolved by acid, and then sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before being eventually excreted. The Brethedans long ago took advantage of this second stomach to use the oma as living starships, telepathically guiding the colossi through the void between worlds. A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.",76800

"Oni, Earth Yai",13,outsider,temperate mountains,"Jagged cracks and pebbled growths mar the surface of this three-eyed giant's rocky skin, making it appear to have burst forth from rugged stone.","Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of stone giants, earth yai scorn that race's humble ambitions, and instead prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power. This belief doesn't necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages, though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power, leading mto become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace more subtle, long-term machinations in their pursuit of gradual and far-reaching ruin. In its natural form, an earth yai stands 16 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds. Ecology Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the stone giants their otherworldly shapes mimic. While stone giants often appear to be sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no impact on their formidable resilience. Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of a catapult shot. Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy bridge supports. Habitat & Society Earth yai dream of conquest like mother oni, but how they pursue victory tends to vary from individual to individual. While all would agree that victory is only attained when one's foes are crushed and shattered, the methods used to accomplish this goal range from brute displays of power to the slow erosion of a foe till nothing remains. The scope of an earth yai's ambitions also seems largely dependent on its age, with younger oni proving content to raid territories and subjugate peasant villages, while older individuals seek greater conquests and the destruction of whole lands. Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim. Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these oni would never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek new challenges-if such opportunities don't present themselves during the oni's rule. These oni might move on to find new opponents, but still regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and instill dread among their prisoners. While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and centuries of experience. An oni who finds itself bested time and time again might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait before a threat to them passes- perhaps with the help of a few inconvenient disasters to accelerate an enemy's decline. When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in such conf licts, but they are never exploited. These oni see a final battle between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred. Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs in mazelike mountains ravines and in large caverns near the earth's surface. These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the oni often make use of their passwall ability to sink through solid barriers or walk past gates that don't appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their liking. If creature interrupts an oni in its lair, the oni violently attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they trespass upon the oni's private home. This obsession with privacy extends not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they themselves demand the lesser creatures' presence. Earth Yai Daifu Just as stone giants develop a variety of special abilities related to their age, so too do earth yai grow in power as their years mount upon them. Known as daifus, such earth yai have Charisma scores of at least 20 and can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: stoneskin, summon monster XI , wall of stone. Most earth yai daifus are sorcerers or oracles with abilities tied to the earth or destruction. Earth yai daifus add +1 to their CRs.",25600
Onyx Deer,5,magical beast,temperate or warm forests,This creature looks like a deer about 5 feet tall at the shoulders with a dark brown head and chest changing to light brown on the rest of its body. A large white patch is prevalent across its back and rump. It has huge antlers at least as wide as a typical human is tall.,"Other than being larger than most common deer, an onyx deer resembles its  lesser cousin. These creatures are found in temperate and warm forestsed lands in the same general habitat as their normal counterparts though onyx deer do not associate with ordinary deer. Onyx deer are herd animals, congregating in groups of up to 20 individuals. Among the adults, the males outnumber the females by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio. Young  make up the rest of the herd . Mating season for onyx deer comes in the fall. During this time males within the herd often clash with one another. Such clashes see the animals square off and charge headlong into each other crashing their antlers together and slashing with their sharp hooves. When one falls, the battle ends. The loser of the battle usually survives, but always leaves the herd. Females give birth to 1d3 young in the early summer months. Onyx deer stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh more than 800 pounds. Onyx deer are generally passive creatures and only attack when threatened or when their herd is threatened. If a herd is molested, both male and female onyx deer defend the young does to the death. An onyx deer begins combat by releasing a loud bellow in an attempt to scare off would-be attackers. Those who stand their ground are met with either a gore attack and hooves or a ferocious bite and hooves. The bite of an onyx deer transforms the wound and flesh surrounding it into a gem-like stone that resembles onyx. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Ooze Golem,8,construct,any,The ten-foot tall column slides towards you. Its body swirls with changing colors and two pseudo pods wave menacingly in the air.,"Believed to be the creation of Masters of the Ooze , ooze golems appear as swirling conglomerations of oozes of columnar or humanoid shape. Their bubbling, shifting form stinks of dead animal matter and sulfur. Ooze golems are often employed or summoned by evil spellcasters and given the task of guarding or protecting an area of great importance. They are sometimes found in the compof normal oozes. These golems are quite prevalent in temples dedicated to The Faceless Lord. Ooze golems are 10-foot tall amorphous creatures of swirling colors: gray, black, dull red, pale green, and brown. They can alter their shape so as to appear roughly humanoid, but their natural form resembles a column or pillar. Two large pseudopods extend from the central trunk and function as arms. No facial features are discernable in either form. In humanoid form, an ooze golem's lower torso ends in two powerful legs and almost-human feet. This creature can flatten its body and squeeze through cracks and openings up to 2-inches in size. An ooze golem attacks by pummeling its opponents with its fists. It employs rudimentary tactics in battle and always fights until destroyed. An ooze golem often grabs a foe and hangs on; dealing acid damage each round the hold is maintained. Construction An ooze golem's body is constructed from pieces of destroyed or slain oozes. Magical bindings are used to hold the pieces together. These materials cost 900 gp.

Orc,0.33,humanoid,"temperate hills, mountains, or underground","This savage creature looks like a bestial version of a savage human, with green-gray skin and greasy black hair.","Along with their brute strength and comparatively low intellect, the primary difference between orcs and the civilized humanoids is their attitude. As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the rest through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force, and think nothing of slaughtering or enslaving entire villages when they can get away with it. They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits them to do so. An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. Orcs and humans interbreed frequently, though this is almost always the result of raids and slave-taking rather than consensual unions. Morc tribes purposefully breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the smarter progeny make excellent strategists and leaders for their tribes. Orc Characters Orcs are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Orcus,35,outsider,any,"This demonic humanoid is squat and bloated, standing nearly three times as tall as a normal human. It goat-like head sports large, spiraling ramlike horns. Its legs are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves. Large powerful arms wield a wicked skull-tipped wand. Two large, black, bat-like wings protrude from its back and a long, snake-like tail, tipped with a sharpened barb, trails behind it.","Orcus is the Prince of the Undead, and it is said that he alone created the first undead that walked the worlds. Orcus is one of the strongest  and most powerful of all demon lords. He fights a never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage war across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends most of his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides to leads his troops into battle . Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and commanders lead the battles. When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes to travel the planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish spellcaster open a gate and speak his name, he is more than likely going to hear the call and step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the spellcaster that called him usually depends on the reason for the summons and the power of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are usually slain after a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in his armies. Orcus stands 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 6,000 pounds. Orcus prefers to conduct battles using his Wand or natural weapons . Generally he avoids direct combat with powerful foes preferring to hang back and pepper them with an array of spells and effects. If pressed into melee, he uses his tail sting against the strongest opponent while focusing his fear gaze on the spellcasters. When given the chance, he summons demons and undead to aid him. If combat goes against him, he uses his greater teleport ability to escape, leaving a retinue of demons and undead monsters to deal with the interlopers. Servants of Orcus The followers of the Prince of Undead are clerics and adepts that venerate death, sorcerers and wizards fascinated with death, and halffiend variants of the aforementioned creatures. His followers are most often clerics, necromancers, and sorcerers. Followers of Orcus are known as Disciples of Orcus and must sign a pact of evil.

In rare cases, oreads' stone-like traits are so strong as to leave no question as to their nature, with growths like rocky outcroppings protruding from their skin or hair like crystalline spikes.

Orog,1,humanoid,temperate hills or mountains,This creature looks like a gray-skinned stocky humanoid with coarse dark hair and dark eyes. Small upward curving tusks jut from its lower jaw.,"Orogs, also called elite orcs or greater orcs, are the much larger kin of normal orcs. They usually reach well over 6 feet tall but closely resemble normal orcs in all ways except build: orogs are much stronger and stockier. It is believed that orogs are the result of the union of a male orc and female ogre. In contrast to lesser orcs, orogs are highly disciplined and straightforward. Orogs within an orc community quickly rise to leadership positions within their clan, although in orc armies the orogs will segregate themselves into all-orog military units. Orog military units are highly organized, tactically superior, and far more dangerous than those of normal orcs. Such orog units form the vanguard of the army to which they belong. Orogs do not separate themselves into their own clans, despite their tendency to self-segregate while in an orc army. Orogs speak Orc, and those specimens that boast Intelligence scores of at least 10 also speak Common. Orogs prefer weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. They try to avoid subterfuge, favoring direct combat to other tactics. Orog as Characters Orogs possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.

Oronci,5,aberration,underground,"A cruel face and orc features dominate this creature's upper half, while its lower quarters bear the sinewy shape of a centipede.","When drow fleshwarping alchemy is turned and focused upon an orc, the obscene result is called an oronci. Upon submersion in a fleshwarper's alchemical ichor, the unfortunate orc's legs merge, and its lower body turns black and elongates to a length of approximately 15 feet. This new body divides into segments, with each segment sprouting a pair of short, sturdy, thin legs. Finally, the horror's tusks connect to newly grown poison ducts that constantly drip poisonous spittle. The orc's head and upper body stay relatively intact as far as fleshwarping goes, though its eyes sometimes adopt a dark, vacant stare. With the exception of the driders, the oronci are among the most useful of the obscenities produced by fleshwarping. They embody all the savage brutality of an orc warrior, but mounted centaurlike upon an even larger, more powerful frame. Being less intelligent than drow, oronci make better shock troopers and advance soldiers for drow armies than the dark elves themselves. Oronci who have escaped the slavery of the dark elves have become favored champions for certain clever orc chieftains. Some oronci even overcome their sensitivity to daylight given time, which makes them better suited to terrorize the surface lands.",1600
Ostiarius,5,outsider,any,"Cloaked in shadows, every curve and sculpted muscle of this vision of physical perfection suggests some new gasping pleasure or titillating torture.","Ostiariuses mind the gate between the world of mortals and the endless excruciating delights of the Plane of Shadow. Their role is twofold: admitting their brethren to the Material Plane using their powers of extraplanar travel, and, more insidiously, convincing mortals to willingly journey with them to their shadowed homeland. They are the emissaries of their people, encouraging susceptible mortals to turn away from the tired philosophies of their dull traditions and dim imaginations and to embrace inconceivable possibilities in a realm of inscrutable darkness. Their guidance leads those they counsel to a path of taboo indulgences and selfish excesses, gradually indoctrinating them in the unsqueamish methods and gluttonous mindset of the kyton race. Eventually, when a mortal is deemed worthy- which is to say, irredeemably corrupted and likely having set others down the same path-the ostiarius leads her into the dark of the Plane of Shadow, where it and its kin gorge themselves upon this newly trapped scrap of flesh and thwarted expectation. An ostiarius might superficially appear to be of gender or completely androgynous, often undergoing physical manipulation to present an appealing figure to those it would court. Extremes of exotic tattooing, piercing, or body modification often mark their forms, and some ostiariuses go so far as to fuse flesh, shining accoutrements, and dark clothing into a single epidermal layer. Most proudly stand over 6 feet tall, though their weights range from exceedingly light to grossly heavy due to interior cavities either scraped empty or filled with the most perversely beautiful but utterly superficial organs. Kyton Rhetoric Ostiariuses are infamous for their half-truths and honey lies. As the reputation of the kyton race does not lead most mortals-even those with the most stained souls- to embrace the pain-tasters' cruel mortal enlightenment, it falls to ostiariuses to turn minds against their own bodies, encouraging philosophies of suffering to take root and override their natural fear and revulsion of kytons' so-called ""gifts."" To such ends, ostiariuses claim absolute openness with those they court, and deftly-supposedly candidly-answer even the most pointed questions about their insidious natures. The following are just a few of the questions commonly put to kyton ostiariuses, and their well-rehearsed answers to each. Kytons are evil. Why should I trust you? ""Evil? Such a small word to sum up my people, our culture, and our millennia-old dogma. I have little belief in the concept. I've seen holy men sacrif ice innocents and be called saints. I've seen mothers who stole only to feed their children go to the gallows. I perceive evil to be an artif icial construct, a mere description created by frightened clerks so they can determine whether one's actions fall within or outside their narrow visions for what reality should be. But am I evil? I believe in potential. I believe that some creatures are without signif icance and not worthy of my hand raised to save them. Conversely, I believe the multiverse blesses some beings with extraordinary traits, with the potential to do-to be-great things. The fact that I exist to seek out such potential and help it flourish means that regardless of what you believe about such small words like ‘good' and ‘evil,' inarguably the cosmos has guided me to you, and as I believe in the power of that cosmos, I believe in you."" My magic says you're evil. Why shouldn't I slay you? ""Pause to consider the source of that information. Something has told you that I am evil, and why wouldn't it? I seek to enlighten. To reveal secrets of reality, rebirth, immortality, and divinity that no creature that calls itself ‘good' would wish to see revealed. Surely my words are heresy in every faith where the blind follow the sighted, for I promise to reveal wonders inherent in every worthy soul, wonders the deities claim are theirs alone."" Your race hails from the Plane of Shadow. Why do you dwell in such a terrible place? ""My people seek to escape form, to escape prejudice, to escape all restrictions that wantonly encage us. To this end, my people voluntarily migrated to the one place in all existence where the body becomes muted, and voices, philosophies, and sensations are amplified. My people are ascetics, the darkness our endless meditation."" Your people originated in Hell. Care to explain? ""Surely you know there are angels as well as devils in Hell. In the home of the righteous, there must be a single law. All who refuse to bow to that law are rebels in the eyes of the empowered, and so must be outcast. Those who refuse to bend to righteousness-or worse, who hold their own visions of righteousness-are exiled to the burning hinterland. But, were my people prisoners of Hell, were we truly damned, could we have left so easily? My people have been pilgrims in mlands, and have come to understand mtruths of the cosmos. Hell was merely the last of mrealms through which we've passed."" Your methods indulge in fear and suffering. Why would I embrace such destruction? ""Pain. Sorrow. Fear. These are not emotions. These are instincts of animals, of lesser beings. Do you think the rat feels contentedness, the snake either love or lust, the sow ecstasy? We are without the vestigial mental ref lexes of mortals. Yet such enlightenment is not our purview alone. We would teach all with minds to understand how to be more than what an evolution of meat and tears would constrain. We offer possibility and revelations of enlightenment, states your kind are predisposed to distrust, to view as revolution, but which those with the potential for greatness clasp as rungs upon the ladder of exultation.""",1600

Otyugh,4,aberration,underground,"This three-legged freak is mostly mouth. Three tentacles, two tipped with barbs and one with eyes, extend from its sides.","Otyughs are particularly vile and horrid creatures that lurk in places most sane creatures avoid. Their lairs are middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic swamps, and sewers-the greater a lair's filth, the greater the draw to the refuse-eating otyugh. They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking eff luvia. Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian. The most horrifying thing to most races about the notorious otyugh is not the nature of its diet or its choice of lairs, but rather that a creature with an otyugh's tastes can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste. Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care.",1200

Owlbear,4,magical beast,temperate forests,"An amalgam of fur and feathers, this bizarre half-bear, half-owl monstrosity raises its huge, ursine claws in anger.","The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite wellestablished in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator. Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering living creatures that cross their paths. Mscholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed. Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs. Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in mcity markets. While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands . A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds.",1200

Pairaka,7,outsider,any,"Blue-skinned and draped in revealing attire, this humanoid fiend has a sultry gaze suggesting all manner of debased pleasures.","A sensual pairing of seduction and destruction, pairakas embody the corruptive nature of unbridled lust. Pairakas spend little time in their true form while on the Material Plane, choosing to cloak themselves instead in alluring forms to seduce potential victims, ruin relationships, and foment obsession. In its true form, a pairaka's body is a foul landscape of blazing rashes, oozing pustules, and taut blisters suggestive of the corruptions it harbors, bodily and spiritually. Pairakas pride themselves on perversion. They love nothing more than turning lovers against one another or destroying the bonds of friendship. Pairakas feed off this slow torment and savor each broken heart or disappointment. They use lust and sexuality as their primary tools, wielding taboos and carnal appetites to sever once-friendly relationships. Pairakas also use their seduction to spread disease, charming victims into physical contact. Just as all other divs suffer a weakness, pairakas cannot stand the color red. They never wear the color or enter a place that is painted red, and they always attack creatures that are garbed in clothes of a crimson hue first.

Panotti,2,humanoid,land,This bald humanoid looks strikingly human except for the long folds of skin that droop from his head and neck to just above his ankles.,"The panotti are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for one startling difference: their enormous ears. A panotti's ears are attached to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang loosely, like an elephant's, but extend almost the length of their bodies. These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but appearances are deceiving. Panotti possess remarkably smooth muscle control along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control their ears at will. Even though panotti look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary. Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in panotti children. Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the compof their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally hearty and capable warriors. On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan.",600
Paracletus,2,outsider,any,"A small cluster of shimmering lights floats in the air, orbited by multiple vibrant crystals and gemstones.","While mortals possess the gift of free will, both logic and emotion inf luence their decisions. The paracletus serve the aeons as agents who connect with mortals and study the inf luence of emotions  upon mortal behavior. They wander the planes seeking mortals with particularly strong emotional or logical capabilities . Once a paracletus locates such a creature, the paracletus remains nearby, studying the target's relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, the paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how outside inf luences affect the subject. Unfortunately for the target creature, whether or not the paracletus uses a helpful or harmful effect is, for all intents and purposes, a matter of random chance-even though to the paracletus's complex reasoning, nothing is left to actual random chance. If presented the option, a paracletus avoids direct combat, and uses its emotion aura to inf luence situations. If pressed to defend itself, it flies at opponents, slamming into them and discharging an electrical jolt of energy in addition to buffeting with its crystalline components. The crystals that orbit a paracletus are solidified aspects of logic, while the swirling vapors and lights that make up its central mass are manifestations of raw emotion- when a paracletus is slain, both the crystals and vapors fade away into nothingness. A paracletus can be chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level neutral spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat. A paracletus familiar does not abandon its mission to observe emotions and logic at play, but it does follow its master's orders-this is one situation where the application of a paracletus's emotion aura need not be random. Although the central mass of a paracletus's body appears to be made of light and energy, it is in fact solid, and feels strangely like electrified flesh to the touch.",600

Pedipalp,2,vermin,warm land,"This creature looks like a cross between a spider and a scorpion. It has six legs and two thin antennae that constantly writhe and wriggle. Two large scorpion-like pincers protrude from just in front of its foremost legs, and a whip-like tail extends from the end of its abdomen.","Pedipalps are also called whip scorpions. The average pedipalp is 5 feet long but can grow to a length of 10 feet. Poisonous Pedipalp A rare variety of the common pedipalp exists.

The poisonous pedipalp is CR 3. Poison Cloud  When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day.

Pegasus,3,magical beast,temperate or warm plains,This magnificient horse has great bird-like wings upon its back and moves with a quiet and proud grace.,"The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings. The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the compof a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one-before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle's straps interfere with the creature's wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount. Pegasi lay eggs-they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life. A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes.",800

Its lair is often made in sunken ships or underwaters caverns and caves. It sustains itself on a steady diet of fish and waters plants. A pelagos is thought to be the creation of an ancient sea god set upon the world to either guard or harass ships and watersborne travelers.

Peluda,10,dragon,temperate marshes or plains,"Shuffling forward on thunderous elephantine limbs comes an immense dragon-like beast. Its serpentine maw snaps angrily at the end of a long, sinuous neck, and steam issues forth from between its razor-sharp fangs. A powerful tail moves in rhythm with the bobbing head, displaying a wicked set of spikes. Scores of quills jut from the beast's flanks, bristling outward with menacing intent.","Wild dragon-kin that stalk the savage places of the world, peludas loathe all the weak, fragile creatures smaller than themselves, especially the various arrogant breeds of humanoids. Viewing themselves as true and regal dragons, these brutes seek to dominate swampsy or overgrown territories but a few miles wide, driving off other creatures and despoiling the land as they please. Often their lands become littered with traces of their passage: great footprints in muddy banks, felled trees, and rotted corpses riddled with peludas' lance-like quills. Although most think themselves clever, peludas swiftly grow tired of tactics and debate, and it often takes little more than the suggestion of a trespasser to make them run amuck. Elder peludas often appear far bulkier than their bare physical frames would suggest. As the majority of their roughly serpentine bodies bristle with lengthy quills, they look to be far stouter than they truly are with their naked reptilian necks, tails, and feet sprouting from a forests of deadly barbs. A typical 15-foot-long adult peluda can raise its head up to 8 feet off the ground and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Ecology Peludas have a voracious appetite, gorging themselves on all manner of beasts drawn to the rivers, marsheslands, and wild plains where they live. Much like a snake, these creatures can unhinge their lower jaw to swallow larger prey after pulverizing it with blows from their massive tail. They prefer to do so, however, after roasting their meal with their fiery breath. Peludas fear nothing smaller than themselves and routinely bring down larger prey even at a short distance with volleys of their poisonous quills. Their dangerous hide also acts as a defense to ward off gigantic predators like rocs or even true dragons, making peludas an unappetizing-and poisonous-meal at best. Although most peludas prefer the cool darkness of reedy marsheslands-especially sparsely forestsed bogs, as their quills can make navigating dense overgrowth frustrating-peludas occasionally venture further inland to enhance their diets, feeding on the livestock, crops, and people of rural communities. They see these excursions as nothing more than brief hunting sorties, often with the opportunity to cruelly ruin the fragile works of lesser creatures. Peludas lay small clutches of eggs that never result in more than two or three young at a time. Ensuring that such limited numbers of offspring reach maturity presents a significant challenge for these violent creatures, as just as mof these young, bald peludas fall to the tempers of their parents as to attacks from interlopers or other beasts. Habitat & Society Peludas often lair in caves, either caverns half-submerged in bogs or cool rents in the earth. While not exceptionally intelligent compared to other dragons, peludas possess a heightened survival instinct and a penchant for collecting interesting shards of metal from tools, armor, and weapons taken from their victims. They also swallow shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, believing it helps strengthen their quills and the potency of their fiery breath. Occasionally a particularly cunning tribe of savage humanoids-typically lizardfolk or orcs-finds a way to assuage the temper of a peluda that lairs nearby, elevating the creature to the status of a local liege or deity. Whether the tribe believes in the dragon-kin's lordly status varies from community to community, though all pay the more powerful creature deference and mprovide offerings of captives and wealth. Although peludas rarely have actual affection for such servants-and more than one tribe has been scoured from the land in a random fit of flaming temper-all revel in the submission of weaker creatures and the gifts of gold and food they bring, as such deeds act as a balm to their typically fragile draconic egos. As nearly all peluda dwell on the fact that they lack the fearsomeness and power of true dragons, they do all they can to exhibit their ferocity and might. While the destruction they cause and the subservience of weaker creatures indulges peludas' fragile delusions, suggestion that they are not every bit as mighty as their draconic peers-especially from those they view as lesser creatures-throws them into a rage few provokers can hope to survive.",9600
Penanggalen,5,undead,any,"A pale face framed by glossy black hair hangs in the air, trailing viscera from the ragged stump of its neck like a grisly tail.","The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific vampiric monstrosities. By day, a penanggalen appears to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when provoked, the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body, coils of viscera and entrails dangling from her throat as she launches into the air, seeking blood to sate her unholy thirst. Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to the lich in that she willfully abandons both her mortality and morality to become a hideous undead monster. While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters, creature capable of performing the vile ritual of transformation can become one. Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a penanggalen. More than one such transformation ritual exists, but all require heinous acts that symbolize the casting aside of kindness, benevolence, and semblance of feelings other than cruelty. Mof these rituals call for the repeated consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other fluids drawn from captured and tortured innocents. A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When returning from a night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs are swollen with blood. In order to fit back into her body, the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of vinegar. Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly deteriorates into foul-smelling grit. The penanggalen presented above was a witch in life. The witch class is presented in full in the Advanced Player's Guide. CREATING A PENANGGALEN ""Penanggalen"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice . Most penanggalens were once humanoids or monstrous humanoids and nearly every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +1. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead . Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6. Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel resistance +4, DR 5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A penanggalen also gains fast healing 5. Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her human body and exposed to direct sunlight. Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. Melee: A penanggalen gains a bite attack and a slam attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base creature's special attacks. She also gains the following additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain : A penanggalen's blood drain special attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage. Create Spawn : When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction. A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. Disease : Any creature a penanggalen bites is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease itself. Wither : A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters and weakens living flesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen's slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4 Charisma damage. Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score. Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Fly, Knowledge , Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following special quality. Separate : During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect as undead . At night, she can detach her head and entrails as a full-round action. Her physical but now hollow body exists as dead flesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to her body, at which point damage done to the body immediately heals . A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed . When a penanggalen wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her fly speed, or of her special penanggalen attacks.",1600

Jagged bolts of lightning form bright, eye-like spots within its churning depths.","Gozreh's herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air and waters. It may in fact have once been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or waters or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dualmaterial elemental shape. Unusual in that it is one of the few elemental creatures serving the Wind and the Waves, Personification of Fury is often courted by the elemental lords to join their ranks as a high-ranking general or advisor on the mortal world, but Fury dislikes the lords' squabbling and petty wars among their kind, seeing itself as a perfect example of how in the material realm elements should mix together without jealousy. It remains neutral in the dealings of various planar entities, and with Gozreh's permission it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival forces-but only in a direct, blunt, and expedient way, for it is a creature of force and action, not gentle diplomacy. Its actions have attracted a small number of sycophants and refugees from the elemental wars, air and waters elementals tired of battle and looking for other ways to fill their immortal lives; these creatures follow Fury and allow it to summon them, and in faithful service to it they allow mortals to summon them. When the herald is on the Material Plane and left idle , it entertains itself by summoning dozens of Small elemental minions and sending them scurrying about, letting them explore for a few minutes and get into mischief. Though Gozreh is both male and female, alternates genders frequently, and answers to both male and female pronouns, Personification of Fury is genderless, and is easily offended if someone calls it a ""he"" or ""she."" It also dislikes being called ""the"" Personification of Fury, as if its name were a title; if a speaker doesn't want to use its full name, it expects to be called ""Fury."" It has a short temper, and has been known to blast even servants of Gozreh with cold or lightning if sufficiently annoyed - those who anger it receive no mercy just because they share the same deific master. It prefers to be conjured during active storms or when such phenomena are nearby; a caster who calls the herald under these circumstances  gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to bargain with it. The creature is also fond of certain monoliths and standing stones used by the church of Gozreh, some of which include large stone faces or roughly anthropomorphic figures. It often flows into such idols, giving them life and speaking as though it were the voice of Gozreh. Having a penchant for dramatics, it might use its control over an object and varied abilities to pose as the deity on a whim or to guide mortals on a desired course. As a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining waters, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watersy death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing of these things, and has no objection to taking lives-even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh. Ecology Personification of Fury is an elemental outsider, and does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. However, it enjoys mixing with the thin air on mountainstops, skimming misty valleys, or tasting the icy waters of the deep oceans. It sometimes forgets its own strength, and may accidentally crush, freeze, or electrocute nearby creatures and objects- its errant bolts of lightning have started mforests fires. It is amoral in this destruction, just as it is in help it unintentionally provides. Certain magical pools, springs, and streams in the mortal realm may be inadvertent manifestations of its presence, changing the ecology of the region where they appear for hundreds or thousands of years. Habitat & Society Fury has no urge to reproduce or create more of its kind; interacting with its minions and mortal worshipers of Gozreh is the closest it comes to familial interests. On the rare occasions when one of its elementals is permanently slain, it has been known to grieve for years, becoming more withdrawn and prone to outbursts, though its attitude is more that of a creature who has lost a pet than that of someone who has lost a friend or relative. When it finishes grieving, it usually travels to the Plane of Air or Plane of waters, working with the lords there in hopes of finding another like-minded minor elemental minion who may replace the one who was lost. Because the herald can recover from almost injury as long as a small portion of it remains, some elementals wandering the Material Plane may actually be derived from its substance, cleaved off in some mighty battle and only becoming self-aware after gathering sufficient air or waters-though they would not recognize kinship.",51200
Peryton,4,magical beast,any,"This creature has a stag's body, a hawk's wings and talons, and the head of a slavering wolf with a rack of sharp antlers on its brow.","Savage creatures of nightmare, perytons combine the features of stags, wolves, and great birds of prey. Though vicious beasts, perytons possess all the intelligence of a human. Perytons hunt creature weaker than themselves, but prefer humanoid prey, as they particularly relish the taste of such creatures' still-beating hearts. Perytons loathe all other creatures, even their own kind, and adult male perytons often attack one another on sight. However, strong females sometimes lead small family flocks composed of the alpha female, two or three weaker females, and up to six fledglings. The flock drives off males when they come of age, but females are allowed to join the pack when they mature, provided they swear allegiance to the alpha female. Unpaired males frequently attack such flocks in the hope of making off with a mate; failing that, they approach more peacefully, with offers of warm humanoid hearts  to attract females. Perytons mate once per year. The mating ritual is short, brutal, and in the end often fatal for the male. Afterward, the female lays a single, foot-tall black egg, which hatches 7 months later. A peryton is 4 feet in length with a wingspan of 11 feet. It weighs 250 pounds.",1200
Pestie,1,fey,underground,This creature is a rather ugly humanoid about 2 feet tall. It has long pointed ears and a large round nose. Its skin is grayish-brown.,"Pesties are the larger, stealthier cousin of the mites. They lack the fangs of their kin but stand taller-though they tend to be leaner-with elongated limbs, long, slender fingers, and large pointed ears. Pesties stand between 2-1/2 and 3 feet tall and weighs 20 pounds. Pesties do not communicate with others  except through body language and crude hand signals. It is unknown whether pesties simply cannot or choose not to speak. Unlike mites who like to swarm over enemies in a sudden rush, pesties prefer to utilize their great speed and employ hit-and-run tactics to keep opponents off-balance. Pestie Society Pesties often are found working with or lairing with goblins or  common mites. They are less likely to band together into large communities than their smaller cousins and have an almost kleptomanic urge to pilfer items of interest or value whenever they see them. This tendency often leads to the pesties being driven out of whatever community they currently live in when their allies' patience reaches an end. However, the trapmaking skills of the mite complement the pesties' adeptness at speed and hit-and-run tactics so that invariably the two groups end up in cooperation again. Pesties that wear out their welcome in a goblin community face a grimmer fate, either succeeding in outrunning their pursuers or ending up in a goblin cook pot. Pestie Characters Pesties have racial Hit Dice and may possess class levels. Pesties have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +6 Dexterity, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma. Pesties are quicker physically but slower mentally than common mites. Small size: Pesties are Small creatures with a +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus on Stealth checks, -1 penalty on CMB/CMD checks, and lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters. Base speed: A pestie's base land speed is 40 feet, and it has a climb speed of 20 feet. Darkvision: Pesties can see in the dark out to 120 feet. Low-light vision: Pesties can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Racial Hit Dice: A pestie begins play with two levels of fey, which provides 2d6 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saves of Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +3. Racial Skills: A pestie's fey level gives it skill points equal to 2 x . A pestie receives the following adjustments: +4 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks. Racial Feats: A pestie's fey levels gives it one feat. Special Attacks: Hatred, spell-like abilities . Special Qualities: Scent, DR 2/cold iron, light sensitivity. Languages: Pesties begin play understanding  Aklo. Pesties with a high intelligence can choose from the following languages: Goblin, Undercommon.

Petitioner,1,alignment outsider,any,"Something seems strange and disturbingly familiar about this wispy, ghostly humanoid shape.","Petitioners are the souls of mortals brought to the Outer Planes after death in order to experience their ultimate punishment, reward, or fate. A petitioner retains fragments of its memories from life, and its appearance depends not only upon the shape it held in life but also upon the nature of the Outer Plane to which it has come. The stat block detailed above presents a typical petitioner formed from the soul of an average human-it does not include of the plane-specific abilities or features a petitioner gains, and should be modified as appropriate depending on the plane to which the petitioner is assigned. Creatures who die, become petitioners, and then return to life retain no memories of the time they spent as petitioners in the afterlife. A petitioner who dies is gone forever-its ""life force"" has either returned to the Positive Energy Plane or, in some cases, provided the energy to trigger the creation of another outsider. Petitioners who please a deity or another powerful outsider can be granted rewards-the most common such reward manifests as a transformation into a different outsider, such as an archon, azata, demon, or devil, depending upon the petitioner's alignment. In rare cases, a creature can retain its personality from life all the way through its existence as a petitioner and into its third ""life"" as an outsider, although such events are rare indeed. Creating a Petitioner ""Petitioner"" is an acquired template that can be added to creature whose soul migrates to one of the Outer Planes following its death . The petitioner uses all of the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted below. CR: A petitioner's CR is 1. In some cases, at the GM's discretion, particularly large or unusual petitioners with higher than normal ability scores may begin with a higher CR; compare the petitioner's statistics to the values on Table 1-1 on page 293 to help determine an unusual petitioner's starting CR. Alignment: A petitioner's alignment is identical to that of its home plane. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to outsider. It loses all subtypes. Its size does not change. Senses: Petitioners lose unusual senses they had, but gain darkvision 60 feet. Armor Class: The petitioner loses all racial bonuses to its Armor Class. Hit Dice: Petitioners lose all racial and class-based Hit Dice and gain 2d10 racial Hit Dice as outsiders. Saves: Petitioners have good Fortitude and Ref lex saves; a petitioner's base saves are Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +0. Defensive Abilities: Petitioners lose all the defensive abilities of the base creature. Petitioners are immune to mind-affecting effects. Attacks: The creature's BAB is +2, subject to modification for size and Strength. It loses all natural attacks and gains a slam attack as appropriate for a creature of its size. Special Attacks: Petitioners lose all special attacks. Abilities: Same as the base creature. Feats: Petitioners lose all feats. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner gains one feat-typically Toughness. Skills: Petitioners lose all skill ranks they possessed as mortals. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner has 12 skill ranks it can spend on skills , and gains bonus skill ranks as appropriate for its Intelligence. Unlike most outsiders, petitioners do not gain an additional 4 class skills beyond those available to all outsiders. Special Qualities: Petitioners lose all special qualities, along with all abilities granted by class levels . Petitioner Traits A petitioner gains additional traits based on its home plane. Abaddon : The ""hunted"" have bodies that are identical to what they had in life-these petitioners are doomed to be stalked and eventually consumed by the daemons that lust for souls. A hunted that survives long enough eventually warps and twists into a daemon. The hunted gain DR 5/- and fast healing 1 so that they provide a slightly more robust hunt for their daemonic predators. Abyss : ""Larvae"" are perhaps the most hideous of petitioners-they appear as pallid, maggotlike creatures with heads similar to those they possessed in life. Larvae that feed long enough on Abyssal filth eventually transform into demons. They have cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10, and instead of a slam attack gain a bite attack as appropriate for their size. Elysium : The ""chosen"" have idealized versions of their mortal bodies. In time, after experiencing the pleasures Elysium has to offer, the chosen become azatas. The chosen gain resistance to cold and fire 10 and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Heaven : The ""elect"" appear similar to their mortal forms, save that they possess a golden halo and feathered wings. After spending enough time aiding heavenly tasks, the elect become archons. They gain a fly speed equal to their base speed . Hell : The ""damned"" retain their mortal forms, but are heavily scarred by various tortures. Those who endure the torments of Hell long enough may eventually be approved for transformation into devils. The damned gain immunity to fire . Limbo : The ""shapeless"" retain their basic forms, but these forms constantly waver and shimmer, as if they were ghosts in peril of dissolving away. After wallowing in the chaos of Limbo for long enough, they can transform into proteans. The shapeless have the incorporeal subtype, and all advantages granted by that defensive ability. Nirvana : The ""cleansed"" take on the forms of animals that closely approximate their personalities. Upon achieving true enlightenment, they transform into agathions. The cleansed gain cold and sonic resistance 10 and a +2 bonus to Wisdom. Purgatory : The ""dead"" appear as animated skeletons but are not undead-in time, they can earn the right to become aeons. They gain DR 10/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. Utopia : The ""remade"" retain the same body shape but have milky white skin covered in dense black script, as if some strange scribe had used them for parchment. Upon deciphering the riddles posed by these complex lines of script, one of the remade can enter an axiomite forge to be transformed into an inevitable. The remade are immune to hostile transmutation effects and gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence.",400
Petrified Maiden,6,undead,land,Fresh blood seeps from the cracks of this weathered but exquisitely detailed stone sculpture of a warrior woman.,"Petrified maidens are the remains of the army of warrior women led by the pirate queen Mastrien Slash in her failed invasion of southern Geb. The wizard king Geb himself cursed the warriors, turning them to stone and creating what is now known as the Field of Maidens. While a petrified maiden appears at first glance to be a construct, it has in fact been animated by the restless undead spirit of the warrior maiden it once was. The nature of Geb's curse remains mysterious even today-it is simply known that occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden's stone weapon changes to steel . The weapon can be recovered when the maiden is destroyed. Connected to one another by some unknown force-perhaps a side effect of Geb's curse-those petrified maidens whose remains have been removed from the Field of Maidens do everything in their power to rejoin their sisters.",2400
Phantasm,8,undead,any,This entity appears as a translucent humanoid with faintly discernable facial features twisted and corrupted by evil. Its arms are long and thin and trail off in wisps of immaterial matter.,"Phantasms are malevolent and sinister spirits that delight in the destruction of good-aligned creatures. While mundead creatures are the undead form of once living creatures, phantasms have no real material connection to living creatures; they are spirits born of pure evil. They are most often found haunting ruined temples or churches dedicated to evil gods, or dungeons constructed by evil creatures; place where the stench of evil permeates the very air. Phantasms are sometimes employed by other, more powerful undead, such as liches or vampires, though for the most part they are solitary creatures . Phantasm gangs, while rare, work together to bring about the destruction of their foes, using their abilities to destroy and corrupt as mopponents as they can. Phantasms appear as translucent humanoid-shaped creatures with faintly discernable facial features resembling a human face twisted and corrupted by evil. Hair, if present, is formed of the immaterial stuff the phantasm is composed of. Their arms are long and thin and end in wisps of the very stuff they are made of. Likewise, their lower torso trails off into the same misty substance. A phantasm is a dangerous foe because of its ability to possess and control a living creature. It begins battle by attempting to possess a foe, and if successful, it then controls the host like a puppet. In addition, while possessing a foe, it is constantly sapping its life energy. When the host is destroyed, the phantasm leaves the body and attempts to repeat the process with aggressors still around. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene",4800
Phantom Fungus,3,plant,underground,Portions of this three-stalked fungoid monster's body seem to fade in and out of sight. A large maw gapes along its entire front.,"A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey. its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling the perimeters of caverns, a phantom fungus remains invisible until it is behind its prey, at which point it snaps at its victim with its vicious maw. A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures. When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if possible-characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud attacks  are preferred over quieter creatures. The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This ""mouth"" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to siphon away nutrients. A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Although they prefer dwelling underground, they have been encountered above ground as well.",800
Phantom Stalker,4,outsider,Elemental Plane of Fire,"This creature resembles a tall, powerfully muscled humanoid with fiery red flesh. Its face is flattish and oval with a large wide mouth and round, inset eyes of orange.","Phantom stalkers live in the Elemental Plane of Fire. In its true form, a phantom stalker appears as a column of fire. It can take a humanshaped form, appearing as a muscular, fiery red humanoid about 8 feet tall. A phantom stalker rarely enters the Material Plane on its own. If encountered, it is usually in the employ of a spellcaster that has summoned it there to do his bidding. A phantom stalker can be summoned using a summon monster IV spell. A phantom stalker is 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds.

Phase Spider,5,magical beast,warm hills,"This large spider-like monster has an eerie, humanoid face surrounded by a shaggy mane of fur.","Phase spiders are voracious predators from the Ethereal Plane who hunt on the Material Plane. When prey is located, the spider shifts to the Ethereal Plane to prepare an ambush. Against a lone victim, the spider shifts to the Material Plane, bites the victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane to wait for the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape. Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen of the Ethereal Plane-the xill. The two races have long fought a bloody war with no real prospect of a resolution anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying and alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need to defeat the sinister xill among other races, but their monstrous forms and often overwhelming hunger make diplomacy difficult. On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate the raw smoky ether in a manner similar to how a spider manipulates webs. Vast, complex nests of semisolid ether float idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, each supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures enjoy each other's company, but have no real concept of family-a newborn phase spider is fully capable of fending for itself and is treated no differently by its parents or siblings than other. The typical phase spider is 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.",1600
Phasma,12,undead,any,A floating semi-transparent humanoid dressed in grayish robes slowly moves toward you. Its face is either nonexistent or concealed behind a translucent gray mask. A faint pulsating white light surrounds its form.,"A phasma is an undead creature spawned when a humanoid or monstrous humanoid fails its Fortitude saving throw against a phantasmal killer spell and dies as a result. Phasmas are extremely evil and highly aggressive with a hatred for living creatures  that knows no bounds. A phasma is usually found haunting an area within 500 feet of where it was slain when it was alive. It is not bound to this area and may travel or move wherever it pleases, though for some reason, a phasma rarely leaves the area where it died. A phasma feeds on the mental strength of living creatures. By sapping a foe's mental strength it weakens its mind, thereby opening it up to the true power of the phasma, the ability to kill an opponent the same way it died-by a phantasmal killer effect. Creatures slain are left where they fall: the phasma has no use for the opponent anymore. A phasma appears as a 6-foot tall incorporeal humanoid dressed in gray robes. A translucent and pale white light surrounds its entire body. A phasma speaks the same languages it did in life and Common . A phasma engages living foe it encounters. It begins melee using its incorporeal touch in order to feed on an opponent's mental strength, often focusing its incorporeal touch on a different opponent each round. Once it feels it has weakened the will of its foes enough, it uses its phantasmagoria ability to try and kill its foes immediately. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",19200
Phasmadaemon,17,outsider,any,"Little can be seen of this fiend, its body cloaked in a shroud of perpetually shifting, ghastly illusions and phantasms. Beneath its shimmering veil, it has glossy black flesh, a bleached white face, and twisted horns. Its long caiman muzzle perpetually gapes, but other than that, its face is void of sensory organs, save for two orbs that move below the surface of its flesh. This creature flows rather than moves, and its flexible body lacks a definite skeletal structure except for a long, bony tail.","Among the most powerful members of daemonkind, the phasmadaemons personify death by fright, and conjure powers of illusion so terrifying that they steal the life from their victims. A freakish creature of rubbery flesh, the phasmadaemon is capable of twisting its body like a hellish contortionist, and its ivory face is often the last thing its victim sees. Though capable of savaging foes with its fangs and claws, it prefers to torment them first with illusory enemies, unreal terrors, and false terrain before finally closing in as the victims' hearts race and finally fail. When a phasmadaemon does confront its prey physically, it prefers to grapple and constrict it to death, looking the victim directly in the face and watching the fear fill its eyes as the blood drains from its cheeks. A phasmadaemon rarely shows its true form all at once, masking itself in illusions or eerie porcelain masks, and it delights in unnerving even its own daemonic allies. A phasmadaemon is 25 feet long from muzzle to tail- though if it desires, it can stretch almost half again that length thanks to its flexible, elastic anatomy-and weighs 1,000 pounds. Ecology Phasmadaemons sometimes form from the type of soul that exemplifies extreme evil, namely those who inf lict or suffer from extreme fear, such as deranged illusionists, schizophrenic serial killers, and corrupt mortals who died at the hands of other creatures that excel at captivating victims' dreams and fears. In other instances, phasmadaemons are merely among the most fearful of the hunted souls of Abaddon, souls who eventually learn to exult in the terror they feel as a soul-devouring daemon stalks them; eventually, these vile souls may transform from the hunted into the hunters-daemons seeking the thrill of the hunt for the horror-stricken faces of their prey. Whether in the chasms of Abaddon or on other planes, phasmadaemons hunt for souls via stealth, following from a distance to study their prey for prolonged periods. They create elaborate illusions, leading their targets into believing in entire fictional environments and creatures, all dependent on the victims' most feared imaginings. They extract each soul's intrinsic, underlying fears, using the figments as weapons against their owners. Phasmadaemons do not seek souls that are merely easy prey-they adhere strictly to their own method of destroying souls, reveling in the grotesque pleasure of striking mortal souls dead with fear-induced heart attacks and other physical maladies. The connection between fear and mortality is something that continually fascinates the morbid curiosities of phasmadaemons, who mix fears like alchemists, conducting experiments and concocting ever more terrifying combinations of horrific imaginings. Habitat & Society Phasmadaemons tend to hunt alone, preferring to develop their own unique styles of torment and horror to unleash upon their victims. While some would suggest that the freakishly complex traps of crucidaemons or the cocooned feeding of sangudaemons rank as the most dreadful and frightening killing tactics among daemonkind, the terrors manifested by phasmadaemons exceed them both. A phasmadaemon extracts a mortal's own fears and turns the figments against their creator, not enjoying the torment the horrors induce so much as appreciating the effects of fear within its victim before the thing's last fatal gasp-the tiny hairs standing upright, the racing heart, jerking muscles, paralysis. Such reactions spawn immense pleasure within a phasmadaemon, which continually seeks ways to fill its victims with dread. Among phasmadaemons, the buying and selling of fears is in itself something of a market, much like the economy of souls within the rest of Abaddon. The fiends exchange their own horrific new imaginings with one another, creating a collection of terrors unfathomable by mortals. Phasmadaemons do not often serve a single Horseman exclusively, their skills not necessarily a boon to particular facet of death. They tend to traverse the outskirts of societies both within Abaddon and outside of it, preying on travelers in the dead of winter nights or seeking out hermits in order to haunt their isolated homes. The tension before the kill is almost as thrilling to a phasmadaemon as the kill itself, and the foul beings wallow in the fear they create before swooping in for the final blow. When they travel in groups, phasmadaemons use their powers to create great multitudes of illusionary images in order to terrorize entire groups or crowds of closely situated people, such as causing heart-stopping incidents in the middle of a playhouse's performance, situating horrific conjurations in the middle of packed bazaars, and positioning frightful images at the gallows at a crowded execution.",102400
Phlegmatic Ooze Swarm,0.5,ooze,underground,"Dozens of tiny globs of slime move on their own, acting as one being, alternately clinging to each other and separating in a riot of oozing momentum.","Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures mtimes their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along as a single unit.",200
Phlogiston,3,plant,temperate forests,"This creature resembles a bush with silvery-green leaves and dark, twisted branches. The sweet smell of cinnamon lingers in the air around it. Four tendrils writhe and slash from its central form.","The phlogiston bush  is an immobile plant found only in temperate regions. Phlogiston bushes gain nourishment from the body fluids and organs of living creatures, particularly the bones and muscle tissue of such creatures. Being plants, they do gain sustenance from sunlight and the soil, so they can go long periods of time  without eating, but given the chance, a phlogiston flower catches and kills living creature that wanders too close to it. These plants generate a pleasing odor noticeable to a range of about 30 feet. It uses this odor to lure semiintelligent creatures  into range where it can use its tendrils and fire bolt attack. These plants rely on living creatures to spread, so on occasion, when not looking for a meal, a phlogiston flower releases a small blast of seedlings in a 5-foot cone directly in front of it. A creature in the area that fails a DC 20 Wisdom check fails to observe that tiny seeds of silvery-green hue are clinging to its body. After 1d4 hours, the seedlings drop off and take root in the immediate area, blooming into a new phlogiston flower in just under 2 months. A phlogiston bush lies dormant until unsuspecting prey comes with range. It then slashes with its tendrils or releases a single fire bolt at its opponent. In combat, the phlogiston flower attempts to grab its prey with a tendril. Grabbed prey is held until it escapes, dies, or the plant is killed. Creatures slain by a phlogiston flower are entwined in its tendrils and slowly digested over the next 6 to 8 hours until there is nothing left . Being mindless, a phlogiston flower fights until either it or its prey is slain. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800

They revel in playing tricks on unwary travelers, leading them on merry chases or getting them lost deep in the forests. They are not necessarily malicious, however some phooka do lean towards evil and murder. A phooka's trickery may include turning itself into an enchanted pony and offer a stranger a ride, only to lead it through brambles and thorns at top speed, or to lead travelers to enchanted springs that cause them to fall into deep slumber and strip them of all their belongings and clothes, then leave behind clues as to where their possessions are hidden.

Phycomid,4,plant,underground,A small blob of decomposing matter covers the ground. Several small mushrooms sprout from the patch.,"A patch of phycomids is often found growing in garbage heaps, refuse, and other such places. A typical patch of phycomid covers an area of 2 feet. The actual number of mushroom-growths varies with the actual size of the patch. The mushroom caps are usually white, red, purple, or yellow in color, and the phycomid's body is milky white.

Pit Fiend,20,outsider,any,"A pair of gigantic, flame-seared wings and eyes smoldering like embers give this towering devil a truly horrific appearance.","Rulers of infernal realms, generals of Hell's armies, and advisors to the archf iends, pit fiends embody the awesome and terrible pinnacle of devilkind. Massive, physically indomitable, and possessed of ingenious evil intellects, these diabolical tyrants hold great autonomy whether in their service to the archf iends, in their rule of vast infernal fiefdoms, or in subjugation of mortal worlds. Thick muscles cling to their gigantic frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable of def lecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell. Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and their dukes alone. While mtravel to higher layers and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell's elite or in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds. Pit fiends are masters of fire and prefer lands bathed in flame. In Hell, this predisposes them to Avernus, Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon the layers most likely to harbor their burning temple-citadels. Fanatics obsessed with diabolical superiority and ironclad obedience, pit fiends left to their own devices raise massive armies, scouring the pits of Hell for the most depraved lemures to transform into true fiends. When convinced they've formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. In the service of the archfiends or other unique infernal warlords, pit fiends hold themselves to a greater cause, obeying the wills of Asmodeus's chosen nobles in the hopes of one day garnering the favor of either the Prince of Darkness or Hell itself. While obedient to the hierarchies of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell's merciless law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind flourish . Only the most powerful of mortal spellcasters can or dare summon a pit fiend. These devils' reactions to summoning are deliberate and swift, usually typified by overwhelming rage that such insignificant beings would waste their immortal time. Those that cannot weather the devils' burning rage are slain-their souls typically racing the pit fiends back to Hell. Those who manage to keep control of the greater devils, though, intrigue them. A pit fiend might dutifully serve a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is always the same: to further corrupt the mortal soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when the mortal inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant. Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience. As such, the eldest pit fiends see in their legions the faces of countless fools who once presumed themselves the devils' masters. Infernal Dukes The most powerful of pit fiends are lords in their own right-members of the elite caste of infernal politics and leadership known as the Dukes of Hell. While not all of the Dukes of Hell are pit fiends, the majority of them are. As a general rule, a pit fiend Duke of Hell has several levels of a particular character class, the advanced simple template, or in some cases unusual spell-like abilities or unique powers over and above those of most pit fiends. Listed here are three sample unique pit fiend duke abilities, but these examples are by no means the entirety of what strange powers an infernal duke might wield. Deathmastery : The pit fiend duke's ability to manipulate the souls of the damned extends beyond the standard devil shaping power. Whenever a pit fiend slays a humanoid, it can attempt to transform the slain creature's soul into a ghost under the pit fiend's control. The pit fiend may control a number of ghosts in this manner equal to its Charisma modifier. Master of Magic : The pit fiend duke has additional spell-like abilities . Hellfire Breath : The pit fiend gains a devastating breath weapon that it can use once every 1d4 rounds. This breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire .",204800
Pit Hag,13,monstrous humanoid,Nine Hells,"Wiry, wicked females look like little more than burned blistered skin pulled over bones. Tiny horns jut from their forehead and they have razor sharp talons springing from their long fingered hands.","One of the cruelest members of the hag race, pit hags bear great pitchforks with which they comb through the embers and bone piles of the deepest pits of Hell looking for the most forlorn souls to torment. They are known to gather armies of lesser souls into brigades with which to carve out their own fiefdoms in the lower planes. A few powerful pit hags serve as concubines and wives of pit fiends , ruling their palaces in their stead during the pit fiend's lengthy campaigns. A pit hag appears as a 6-foot tall female humanoid with crimson red skin, small upward pointing horns of golden-red and eyes the color of the fires of Hell itself. Its hands and feet end in wickedly sharp curved claws and its mouth is filled with razor-sharp fangs that they constantly lick with their forked black tongues. A pit hag has a small barbed tail . Pit hags attack with their spells before closing in with pitchforks and claws. Their melee abilities are prodigious. They prefer to attack a single foe at a time, choosing clerics and paladins over other enemies. Given the chance, a pit hag uses her aura of affliction ability to disease as mof her opponents as she can at once before unleashing a barrage of spells on her hapless opponents.

Pixie,4,fey,temperate forests,"This tiny, whimsical-looking humanoid darts about swiftly on wildly colored gossamer wings.","Perhaps the best-known and most elusive of all fey creatures, pixies live in the deepest, most pristine forests, but their insatiable curiosity often leads them far from home.

Pixies talk quickly and easily become overexcited. Strange beings both of and beyond the natural world, pixies have magic that occasionally favors them in strange ways. For example, one out of every 10 pixies exhibits an additional spell-like ability that it can use once per day , usually baleful polymorph, beast shape II , or even a powerful spell like irresistible dance. Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows-as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects.

While their origin is not fully known, it is widely accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world. Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma oozes have been encountered in both of these locations does little to help solve the debate. A plasma ooze flies by somehow interacting with gravity and magnetic waves, drifting through the air in a manner similar to the way a jellyfish swims in waters. This creature's only real purpose is to consume, and it prefers to do so by drawing prey into its fiery, electrified core. Scholars find it curious that while a plasma ooze can only attract and repel metallic substances, the thing can only digest organic matter, and rather slowly at that. Survivors of plasma ooze attacks are rare, but such victims describe the pain of being struck by one's rays as like being pulled apart piece by piece. Wounds left by a plasma ooze's touch resemble hideously melted burn scars. A plasma ooze is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.",76800
Pleroma,20,outsider,any,"Within the shadows of this vaguely humanoid figure stir swirling colors and spheres, as if it encompassed all the night skies.","The pleroma is the most powerful of all the aeons. As a manifestation of the opposing acts of creation and destruction, a pleroma exists in a state of flux, its very form shifting between creation and oblivion within the ebon folds of its vaporous cloak. One who gazes upon a pleroma could spend days studying the continual changes of its form, which most resemble the shifting of celestial bodies within the universe sped up to a pace at which the swirling of galaxies and the tumble of planets form a strange dance. Pleromas view the concepts of creation and oblivion not so much as separate processes, but rather as two parts of a cyclical passage that everything in existence must explore. Pleromas guide this progression, ensuring everything remains balanced, such that whatever is created can be destroyed, and that nothing becomes so static that these two processes slow to a halt. For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be mmore things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself. Therefore, eternity and infinity are states that can be changed, or altered, if only slightly. Pleromas maintain such changes are necessary to keep the cosmos from becoming static and unbalanced, a state they refer to as apocalypse, or the end of everything. Of all the aeons, pleromas possess the strongest connection to the entity or concept they refer to as Monad. All aeons believe themselves to be extensions of this entity, and while they act freely and independently of the entity, they always act within the constricts of its will or needs. This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed. Pleromas typically travel alone. Their arrival in a region almost always heralds some sort of dramatic change. They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conf licts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed.",204800

Poisonous Frog Swarm,2,animal,temperate or warm forests or swamps,"Each frog in the hopping army bears black stripes on its hind legs and sickly, yellowish eyes.","Poisonous frog swarms are composed of small, fierce, poisonous frogs. The swarm moves collectively, hopping or jumping toward their prey. Single poisonous frogs mate during the second half of the year. The male attracts a female through a series of unique mating calls consisting of strange guttural sounds. When a female answers the call, she lays a clutch of 1d6 eggs in a damp, dark area covered with leaves. The male fertilizes the eggs and protects them during their incubation period. Two weeks later the eggs hatch and the male carries the tadpoles to the waters on its back. Tadpoles reach maturity in two to three months. A single poisonous frog is a small dark green frog with black bands or stripes on its hind legs. These stripes function as a warning to predators that the frog is poisonous. The skin of a poisonous frog is very smooth to the touch. The middle digit on each of its extremities is slightly shorter than the others. Poisonous frog swarms attack by engulfing their prey and subjecting it to the frog's deadly poison. Creatures that begin their turn in a poisonous frog's space suffer swarm and poison damage.

Polevik,5,fey,swamps or underground,"Toadstools, puff balls, and other bizarre fungal growths sprout from this small, hunchbacked man's mold-streaked body. His beady eyes burn with paranoia and malice.","The secretive and suspicious poleviks cultivate gardens of fungi in deep bogs and caves far from civilization, jealously guarding the secrets of their fungal alchemy from the rest of the world. Once natives of the First World, they retain some of that plane's potent life energy, which specifically encourages the growth of fungi and molds. This enables them to turn their own spry and twisted bodies into fertile ground in which to cultivate their signature puffball weapons. Averaging a few inches shy of 4 feet tall and weighing approximately 115 pounds, individuals can vary in size depending on the number and size of fungal growths that they nurture upon their bodies. They rarely live beyond 300 years. Ecology Poleviks are omnivorous but prefer decomposing meat that is already furred with fungus or ripe with mold. They rarely go to the trouble of actively hunting food; instead, they scavenge the remains of small creatures that find their way into their lairs and fall victim to the dangerous plants and molds they cultivate. Although poleviks could subsist on the mushrooms that they grow, they consider it a terrible waste to use these mushrooms for something as prosaic as food. As with mcreatures of the First World, their cycle of reproduction is somewhat bizarre; poleviks reproduce only after their death. As a polevik's body begins to rot, one of his unique fungal infestations begins to consume his flesh and eventually grows into a colony of large toadstools. After a period of 1 year, the stalk of the largest toadstool bursts open and gives birth to a new, fully grown polevik. While already possessing all the skills and abilities of his race, the newborn carries none of the memories of his progenitor. As a result, a newborn polevik knows nothing about the world beyond his immediate surroundings, and his paranoid nature gives him little desire to learn more. Instead, he begins to enthusiastically cultivate the corpse-grown fungal colony that gave birth to him, adding it to the fungal garden of his long-decomposed predecessor. Habitat and Society Poleviks are solitary and reclusive creatures who consider fungi and molds to be both their closest friends and their most treasured possessions. Though they are able to communicate with all types of molds and mushrooms, poleviks occasionally find fungi's limited frame of reference frustrating. This sometimes leads poleviks to associate with intelligent fungoid creatures such as leshies and myceloids, although they treat the former as servants and the latter as rivals. Most scholars agree that the poleviks were cast out of the First World, exiled for some ancient insult to one of the Eldest. Though scholars disagree on which of those unique beings the poleviks offended, evidence of polevik gardens has been discovered by travelers in the Hanging Bower of the Green Mother, leading to speculation that poleviks may have once been her servants. Exile may have stripped them of an unending existence in the First World, but the stability of the material world gives them ample opportunity to cultivate and experiment with their beloved fungal companions. It is for these experiments that they are widely hunted by wizards seeking obscure spell components, and by alchemists who wish to learn the secrets of the polevik's miraculous ability to mix fungi into concoctions that seem impossible to create outside of a laboratory. Fearful of the outside world, poleviks rarely leave their lairs, but creatures that find their way into a polevik's gardens face vicious opponents. While poleviks are dangerous on their own, their usual tactic is to lead interlopers within reach of the deadly molds and fungi with which they share their lairs. Most who seek poleviks fall prey to ascomoids, brown molds, phantom fungi, phycomids, violet fungi, yellow molds, and others long before they face the direct attacks of these obsessive fey. Puffballs The most treasured of a polevik's fungi is the puff ball. In addition to the standard puff ball, which is rife with the deadly pulsing puffs disease, poleviks cultivate certain other varieties, each with its own unique properties. Deathrot Spores: Despite their name, these black puff balls are no threat to living creatures. When applied to a corpse, they quickly consume the necrotic flesh, stripping all meat from the skeleton over the course of a minute. This ability to easily conceal the identity of a murder victim makes deathrot spores prized by assassins. These puff balls can also be brought to bear against certain types of undead. When hurled as a ranged touch attack against non-skeletal, corporeal undead, deathrot spores inf lict a -2 penalty to the creature's natural armor for 10 rounds. Flamequench Mushrooms: These dun-colored puff balls are grown from a species of brown mold. When thrown into a fire, the puffball releases spores that suck in the heat from their immediate area. This has the effect of completely extinguishing a 5-foot square of nonmagical fire.",1600

Possession Lesser,6,outsider,any,"An impression of unmistakable malice pervades the area, the vague yet undeniable sensation of looming malevolence and faint foul breath.","Diabolically clever and immortally creative, the legions of Hell use all the tools at their disposal to undermine and corrupt the souls of mortalkind. Among these tools are the souls of unabashedly depraved and hateful mortals sentenced to Hell in punishment for lives of sin. The foulest of these souls occasionally find themselves plucked from their torments and reforged in infernal crucibles, etched with bindings of hellish magic, then set loose upon the living. These evil souls bear mof the powers of devils, but fall outside the normal infernal hierarchies, not being considered true devils by their fiendish peers. Rather, they are gidims, Hell-bound souls made weapons of the Pit. More than mere souls yet less than fiends, gidims find themselves barred from the mortal plane by the laws of existence. Their minds and memories linger on half-forgotten lives, however, and upon emotions and sensations long lost to fiends. Thus, they endlessly seek ways to infiltrate the paths of the living. Traveling to the Ethereal Plane, they peer into the Material Plane, seeking out hapless mortals and drawing power from their hatred, their violence, their sorrow, and especially their fears. Continued feeding upon and encouragement of such emotions grants them greater ability to invade the mortal realm and potentially steal new bodies, through which their foulness might live again. Two breeds of gidim exist, lesser possession devils and greater. Both appear nearly identical, but greater possession devils are created from spirits of extraordinary, near-legendary evil beings. These foulest of souls are granted even more powerful diabolical abilities and are often loosed by their infernal masters to torment, unhinge, and ultimately destroy the mortal enemies of Hell. Lesser possession devils are typically left to their own devices, using their abilities to sow fear, torment innocents, spread mistrust, and ruin lives.",2400
Proscriber,15,outsider,any,"Standing proudly, an 8-foot tall warrior dressed in full plate armor, wields a weapon , and carrying a shield, waits as if to be summoned forth. Heraldic symbols inscribed on its shield, armor, and weapons pronounce his faith to all.","When a divine caster severely angers his or her god by deviating from the deity's spoken word, the god often sends one of its agents to redeem the blasphemer-the proscriber. They are the ""messengers"" of the gods and are sent to punish a divine caster that has offended his or her deity. Proscribers are found in the employ of all deities, from the kindest to the vilest-they cover all nine alignments.  Redemption as dictated by the deity and carried out by the proscriber can vary from mild punishment to extremely harsh. Harsh punishment meted out by evil-aligned proscribers often takes the form of death. Proscribers are usually sent to deal with divine casters that have strayed from their alignment. Minor transgressions are not the realm of the proscriber and are usually left up to the divine caster's superiors or church to deal with. Proscribers can be encountered on of the inner or outer planes, so long as a deity maintains its home there. Proscribers never leave the confines of the deity's home except as commanded by the god. If encountered outside a deity's home, the proscriber is on a mission for the deity it serves. When traveling other planes, the proscriber often uses its polymorph to assume a shape that allows it to move undetected without drawing attention to itself. However, when it confronts its target, it always assumes its true form When a proscriber is sent to deal with a creature, it uses its discern location ability to pinpoint the target's precise location before plane shifting to the target's location. Upon arrival and before confronting the target, the proscriber casts align weapon  on its longsword. It then casts death ward, divine power, and sanctuary on itself. The proscriber then confronts the target and charges it with its sins before doling out its punishment. This punishment can be anything from the proscriber casting blindness or bestow curse, or in the case of evil proscribers, perhaps casting slay living or some other vile spell. If attacked, the proscriber fights back using its weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. Non-evil proscribers generally do not attempt to kill the target or its allies, but will not pull its punches  against its aggressors. If combat goes against the proscriber, it tries to casts word of recall and escape. The power of a deity infuses the proscriber's armor and shield and thus do not hamper is movement speed. It still suffers the normal armor check penalties to skills, however. Upon its death, the proscriber and its armor, shield, and weapon vanish in a flash of light .

They then wait nearby, both to laugh at the inevitable mishaps and to make sure their personal unluckiness is passed off on their victims. Pugwampis live in caves or ruined buildings, occasionally venturing forth to find victims upon which to inf lict their sick senses of humor. Their ""jokes"" tend to involve spikes and excrement, or sometimes pits full of spiders or campsites that flood with swamps waters. Certainly only the pugwampis consider their jokes funny. As all pugwampis are somewhat deaf, when not trying to be stealthy, they tend to scream and yell loudly so they can hear themselves and each other. At some point in the distant past, pugwampis became enamored of gnolls, seeing in the beast-men a kindred form and thus aspiring to the height and deadly prowess of the savage warriors, whom they honor as gods. Gnolls, for their part, hate pugwampis even more than other creatures, mostly because of the gremlins' weakness and sickening fawning, though they sometimes keep the gremlins around just to torment them.",200
Pukwudgie,7,monstrous humanoid,"temperate forests, hills, or mountains","A merging of an emaciated man and a porcupine, this sinister creature smells of death and decay.","The vile pukwudgie is a small, hunchbacked humanoid covered with long, sharp quills. These quills, like those of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies. This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a little more than 30 pounds. Pukwudgies are frequently found in the compof undead. This retinue usually consists of zombies and skeletons created via their poisonous quills ability or their ability to animate dead bodies. They have a strong preference for animating the bodies of dead animals over other creatures, and often use undead animals as mounts. A pukwudgie usually stays away from well-traveled areas and humanoid settlements, but may sometimes slip into small villages in the night to steal children. The little horrors enjoy the tender flesh of newborn babies immensely, and are often willing to go through great personal risk to secure infantile repasts when they are available. Their delight in arson only further makes them a bane of small villages.",3200
Purple Worm,12,magical beast,underground,"This enormous worm is covered with dark purple plates of chitinous armor. Its giant, tooth-filled mouth is the size of an ox.","Purple worms are giant scavengers that inhabit the deepest regions of the world, consuming organic material that they encounter. They are notorious for swallowing their prey whole. It is not uncommon to hear of a group of adventurers vanishing down the ravenous maw of a purple worm, screaming as they disappear one by one. Although they seek to consume living creatures, purple worms also consume vast amounts of dirt and minerals as they burrow underground. The insides of a purple worm may contain a considerable number of gemstones and other items able to withstand the corrosive acid inside its gullet. In areas filled with valuable minerals, such as those near dwarven mines, the natural tunnels created by burrowing purple worms are often filled with vast amounts of unrefined ores. A purple worm usually claims a large underground cavern as its den, and while it returns here to rest and digest food, it spends the majority of its time on the prowl, burrowing through the endless dark or slithering along established tunnels in the constant drive to feed its immense hunger. Although not completely mindless, purple worms are rather stupid. They make popular guardians for those who have the magic to control them or a chamber in their lair large enough to hold one captive. Although the deep-dwelling purple worm is the most common of its ilk, variant immense worms of differing colors dwell in other remote wildernesses. A sleek, mottled blue-and-green variant of the giant worm dwells in deep underground lakes or tropical seas . A deep crimson variant of even greater size dwells in remote badlands and rocky deserts .

Qallupilluk,7,monstrous humanoid,cold waters,"The lumpy, scaled hide of this monstrous humanoid woman drips with icy waters, as do its lank, tangled black hair and ragged sealskin garments, both decorated with numerous shells and tiny living crustaceans. A curiously sweet smell wafts from her.","1d6 Creature CR Source 1 grindylow 1/2 Bestiary 2 148 2 reefclaw 1 Bestiary 2 234 3 bunyip 3 Bestiary 2 50 4 merrow 3 Bestiary 2 189 5 scrag 5 Bestiary 268 6 saltwaters merrow 6 Bestiary 2 189 Qallupilluks  are sinister and much dreaded haglike denizens of far northern seas. Inhabitants of coastlines regions fear them as child snatchers who steal the young and drag them below the waves. Those stolen are rarely seen again, as they are transformed into horrible scaled monstrosities enslaved by their adoptive ""mothers,"" though they are sometimes turned against their former families and friends with a dreadful hunger if the qallupilluk becomes angered. Qallupilluks are always female. Most stand about 5-1/2 feet tall, though their hunched posture makes them appear shorter. They typically weigh about 160 pounds. Ecology Qallupilluks are most commonly found along the frozen shorelines and pack ice of arctic and subarctic seas and oceans, though they can occasionally be found in large coldwaters lakes and rivers. During the warmer months, they may lurk in the dark and chillsy depths of their watersy homes, and likewise in the heart of winter, when pack ice is at its thickest, they are unlikely to venture too close to the surface unless some greater need drives them. During the seasonal transitions when the ice cracks and shifts, when it's treacherous even for experienced ice hunters and fisherfolk to travel, these vicious crones prove most dangerous. They wait near gaps and weak points in the ice and listen for the footsteps of creatures above, sometimes humming or tapping insistently on the ice like trapped seals, in the hope of drawing the curious-especially children-onto dangerous ground. When they hear victims approaching, qallupilluks usually hide to allay suspicion, at least long enough for the qallupilluk's supernaturally sweet scent to cloud the children's minds and leave them vulnerable to the qallupilluk's magical charm. Children venturing too near are snatched up in the qallupilluk's long arms and dragged below, thrust into the capacious hood of the qallupilluk's amautik  and carried off to its subwaters domain. While a qallupilluk's magic can sustain such lost souls underwaters, it either lets its prey drown-saving it to be consumed later-or acts swiftly to transform the victim's mind and body into a monstrous servant that it treats as its own misshapen child. Qallupilluks are always female and have great difficulty reproducing. They steal land-dwelling humanoid children whenever possible, in part to reduce their loneliness and to lash out at the surface dwellers that seem to have so easy a time of procreating. More importantly, however, they steal children in order to cultivate potential breeding stock. While attempts to breed with natural-born merrow and similar waters monstrosities have universally ended in failure, some unique factor in the nature and potential of other humanoids transformed into such beasts offers at least some chance of successful conception. Even then, success is hardly guaranteed, but those transformed unfortunate that breed true may allow the qallupilluk to birth another of her kind. Habitat & Society Qallupilluks live along the murky floor of their watersy domains, but rarely dwell far from humanoid habitation. They may craft hovels or lodges from stone or coral on the seabed, or rarely from sunken logs, stumps, and snags in freshwaters lakes. Some few craft semipermanent homes in the submerged recesses of icebergs floating through the cold seas. Qallupilluks are one of mdangers that arctic tribes use to reinforce their strong cultural and behavioral taboos and rituals. They feature in mtales of northern tribes as bogeymen-cautionary tales to warn children away from wandering alone, accepting gifts from strangers, venturing too close to the seashore, and especially wandering onto cracking or unstable ice. The dangers they present are all too real in the life of the tribes, and give ample force to the cautionary fables of village shamans. Qallupilluks are known to possess fragments of ancient and obscure natural secrets, and those in search of such lore sometimes cast offerings into cracks in the ice in an effort to implore the qallupilluk to answer their request. Qallupilluks favor offerings of beads, jewels, coins, and ivory carvings, though those offering them gifts must be careful to offer nothing that will reveal a ref lection. Qallupilluks loathe their hideous appearances and do not wish to be reminded of them. Those foolish enough to offer a mirrored item do not generally live to regret their mistake. Still, for those whose offerings are sufficient, a qallupilluk may reveal herself to the supplicant and engage the creature in conversation. A wise supplicant will offer compliments and sweet-talk or offer up additional gifts of food and drink, or even an invitation to community festivities. Though they recognize their own hideousness and their reputation, qallupilluks are vain enough to fall prey to flattery and greedy enough to be taken in with promises of future rewards. They will abide by the letter of covenant or promise they make, but are swift to take revenge on those they discover have tricked them or who renege on an agreement.",3200

Quantum,20,aberration,any,"This creature seems to have no true shape, as its outline flickers and changes seemingly at random. At first it appears to have four tentacles, then in a flicker eight more appear and waver menacingly before shimmering once more out of existence. Its general shape is serpentine, with an uncertain number of tentacles dangling beneath it, but the only constants are its six glowing eyes, three on each side of what must be its head.","The quantums hail from beyond and between all planes. The first quantum is said to have followed a lost band of adventurers back after they became lost on a planar journey. A quantum exists simultaneously in mdimensions at once, which gives it a flickering, seemingly insubstantial shape as if some mad god is continually creating and re-creating it on a whim. If its form could somehow be stabilized into only three dimensions, a quantum would resemble a flattened jellyfish with a knob at the top containing six unblinking eyes. It has an oblong body with mtentacles radiating out from beneath its body. The exact number of tentacles cannot be known, however, since stabilizing a quantum's shape is a task yet to be undertaken and may not even be possible. Quantums move by avoiding space entirely. A quantum hovers like some eerie jellyfish but doesn't fly by conventional means. Instead a quantum actually teleports short distances too fast for the eye to detect and in this manner it appears to be hovering. A quantum can also teleport across greater distances. At one moment a quantum can be in one space and then in an instant it is somewhere else, having never been at point between. The flickering form of a quantum allows it to attack with one tentacle, two, six, as mas it needs. Attack-capable limbs seem to manifest themselves as they are needed, then vanish again as if they had never existed. A quantum lashes out at its foes with its tentacles. Against a particularly powerful opponent, it uses its disintegration attack. When facing multiple foes, a quantum uses its quantum form to better its odds or make its escape.

Quasit,2,outsider,any,"Ram horns curl back from the twisted head of this tiny winged demon, and its body is thin and wiry.","The quasit is perhaps the least powerful demon, yet it is not the least respected-even quasits hold themselves above the dretch horde, and true to their natures, dretches lack the courage or drive to prove the quaits wrong. A quasit's first role in life is that of a familiar to a spellcasting master, but those quasits who escape from this humiliating servitude become free-willed and much more dangerous. A typical quasit stands a foot and a half tall, and weighs only 8 pounds. Alone among the demonic horde, quasits do not form from the dead souls of evil mortals. Instead, they form from living souls-when a spellcaster seeks out a quasit to serve him as a familiar, his soul brushes against the Abyss and it reacts, carving from itself a quasit linked to that spellcaster's soul and forming a powerful bond between the two. Newly created quasits are birthed directly into the Material Plane, where they become familiars, and while bonded to their masters' wills, all quasits hate and loathe their lieges, as they can feel the pulse of their lords' souls and know that they could have been more. A quasit serves, yet it watches and waits for mistakes that might cost its master's life, or even better, an error that might let the quasit turn against its master. When a quasit's master dies, the quasit can attempt to follow the master's soul into the Great Beyond by making a DC 15 Will save. This functions as plane shift, but affects only the quasit and transports it into the Abyss and places its master's soul in the quasit's possession as a writhing larvae rather than using the evil master's soul to create new demonic life. In this manner, a quasit can use its newly captured soul to bargain with more powerful denizens of the lower planes, and perhaps secure a vile transformative ""promotion"" to a more powerful form of life in the process. Rarely, a quasit elects to ignore its master's death and instead remains on the Material Plane to seek other ways to entertain itself-usually settling in an urban area where there are plenty of folk to torment.",600
Queen Thermite,6,vermin,any,This creature looks like a giant reddish-hued termite. Immense heat radiates from its body.,"Thermites are extraplanar vermin that dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are rarely encountered anywhere else . Once in a rare while a gang or band of these creatures stumble through a vortex and sets up their nest on the Material Plane. Such a nest is always located near a massive heat source . On their home plane, thermites build large underground nests. The bulk of the colony is maintained by the workers-whose job it is to construct the nest, forage for food, feed the queen and soldiers, and repair the nest. Soldiers defend the nest against intruders and trespassers. About a week after the nest is finished, the queen takes a king  and they construct a reproduction chamber where she lays 10-20 eggs each day over a period of a week. Young thermites are helpless and depend solely on the queen and workers for food, protection, and so on. Young become independent after several months, and the reproductives  fly off to form their own nests. The cycle above then repeats.  Thermites are red in color and about 5 or 6 feet long with large biting mandibles and segmented antennae. Soldiers are slightly larger than workers and have slightly larger heads with oversized mandibles. The queen can reach a length of 12 feet or longer and as she ages, she becomes bloated, resembling a giant reddish colored maggot. Reproductives resemble workers and soldiers but are slightly darker in color and have translucent reddish wings. Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off would-be interlopers. Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400

Its head is overly large, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and bright, shiny eyes. The thing chirps, lashes its long thin tail, and then with a flap of leathery wings is in the air once again.","Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves. The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the waters in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger. Quetzalcoatlus Perhaps the largest of the pterosaurs, the quetzalcoatlus  is truly an awe-inspiring sight in the air, with its impressive 40-foot wingspan. On the ground, this creature's profile bears an uncanny resemblance to that of a giraffe, save for the fact that the folded wings arch up to either side of its lightly feathered body, and its head bears a horrific, razor-sharp beak.

How they came to be evil and malign is still a mystery, but legend speaks of the first quicklings as being great sorcerers. Elven scholars believe these quickling sorcerers unleashed some spark of the arcane that was never meant for mortal creatures. Quicklings resemble small elves with large ears that rise to points above their heads. Their skin is pale blue to blue-white and hair is either silver or white. They prefer clothes of bright and boisterous colors; reds, yellows, silvers, blacks, and blues are among their favorites. Quicklings never wear armor. Quicklings speak Common and Aklo. Both are spoken so quickly that even those able to speak one of the languages may still find it difficult to converse with a quickling. Because of their rapid metabolism, quicklings reach adulthood by the age of 2, middle age at 5, old age at 12, and venerable at age 15. No creature can match the natural speed and agility of a quickling. It knows this, and uses its great speed to its advantage in combat. A quickling often rushes an opponent, stabs it with its dagger, and then retreats out of melee range before an opponent can react.

Quickwoods usually root themselves to a particular location and rarely move. When they do move, they pull themselves slowly along with their roots. A typical quickwood stands 16 feet tall. Quickwoods use their remote sensing ability to keep tabs on their surroundings. If trespassers are detected, the creature simply waits until one or more come within range of its roots before lashing out and striking.

Its head is wolf-like and it has six muscular legs. Its body is long and ends in a thick furred tail.","Raggoths are aggressive predators with voracious appetites and a killing instinct that makes them quite deadly in battle. Though its hunting area typically covers only about a mile around its lair, raggoths are known to track their prey up to 10 or more miles. Whether this only occurs when food is scarce or if the raggoth simply hunts and tracks its prey for the sheer thrill of the hunt is unknown. Raggoths by their very nature are solitary, though sometimes they will work together to track down an elusive target or work together to bring down a particularly powerful opponent. Typically raggoths working in concert with one another are a mated pair. Raggoth dwell in thick forests and make their home amidst the foliage or in shallow caves and caverns. If a mated pair is encountered, there is a chance  that 1d4 young are present. Young are born live and are fully dependent on their mother for the first year of their life. Around 12 to 18 months they begin to gain their independence, but do not fully leave the lair until they are around 2 years of age. A young raggoth reaches maturity around 4 years of age. A raggoth is about 8 feet long and weighs about 450 pounds. Its fur is jet black, its nails and teeth are dull white, and its eyes are dull yellow. Raggoths are ambush hunters and always use stealth tactics when hunting and tracking their prey. When spotted, a raggoth moves slowly toward its target and then quickly bursts from its hiding spot at its opponent.

Raiju,5,outsider,land or skies,"The air around this strange, pale animal sparks with erratic flashes of static electricity, its body constantly twitching as if filled to capacity with the energy. It suddenly perks up, alert and seemingly ready to bolt.","Raijus are beings of living electricity that cross the border between the mundane world and their native plane, a region of the Plane of Air alive with endless thunderstorms. Raijus can be involuntarily hurled across the dimensions by a powerful lightning bolt originating in the Plane of Air, or might be called by magic users to do their bidding. When the weather is calm, raijus are quiet, and assume the forms of Tiny or Small animals such as cats, raccoon dogs, monkeys, or weasels. As weather gets worse, however, so do their tempers. In their real form, raijus appear as lean, foxlike creatures with long, sharp claws and luminous eyes, shrouded by crackling electricity. These swift, even panicky, creatures are charged with the electricity of their native realm, and those who touch them risk receiving a deadly shock. In times of great distress, they transform entirely into living electricity, a force that few barriers can contain and even fewer creatures can survive the passage of. In their natural forms, raijus measure about 3-1/2 feet long and weigh 40 pounds, but they often take the form of small mammals when not on the Plane of Air. They can be still recognized as raijus in this form, however, as they bear markings suggestive of jagged lightning. Ecology When they are born on the Elemental Plane of Air, raijus are semi-sentient, formless spheres of living electricity. Only after a period of weeks or months do they gradually take on a favored form, that of a vaguely rodent- or caninelike beast, agile enough to twist and bound amid the endless storms and debris that soar through their home plane. Sometimes particularly powerful elemental storms, strange eddies of magic, or drifting portals bring raijus to the Material Plane. When this happens, invariably during a thunderstorm, the creature spends but a little time regaining its bearings; it then uses its innate shapechange power to blend in with the local fauna, taking on the shape of a local animal-typically a cat, raccoon dog, monkey, or weasel. While such raijus constantly seek to return to their home plane, they aren't terribly uncomfortable on the Material Plane. When the weather is calm, raijus are likewise quiet, and remain in their apparently harmless animal forms all the time. As weather gets worse, however, they become increasingly energetic, racing and soaring about in rampages that occasionally prove accidentally destructive. They typically resume their natural forms during such storms, reveling in their memories of their home plane. Some scholars believe that raijus can return to their native plane when lightning strikes them, thus explaining the creatures' eagerness and agitation during such weather. Habitat & Society Raijus are extraplanar creatures that have little organization on their home plane, roaming and romping as little more than wild animals in their dangerous planar wilderness. On the Material Plane, they gravitate toward areas where storms are frequent, or where the effects of lightning are apparent. This means they frequently occupy the windward sides of mountains and wet forests, eagerly making small dens in the trunks of lightning-blasted trees or scorched, rocky crevices. Raijus can live on the Material Plane indefinitely, though all seek ways they might return to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those separated from their native plane rarely manage to find their way home without the intervention of some other being. Although life on the Material Plane often means a raiju will never encounter others of its kind again, few seem to realize this fact, or, if they do, become despondent over it. Rather, mraijus adopt the habits and communities of the creatures they spend the most time imitating and live as such creatures-except, of course, during violent lightning storms. Mbelieve that despite their destructive natures, raijus are good luck. This belief comes from the creatures' propensity for finding warm spots to nestle into and rest in during the lazy times between storms. One story tells of a raiju that found a snug spot in the navel of a sleeping giant. The giant was exhausted after a day of tromping on a local town and stealing away an entire year's harvest of rice, so it didn't even notice the sleeping creature. When the giant finally awoke and felt the dozing creature's claws on its belly, it flew into a panicked rage. The sudden activity startled the sleeping raiju, and it immediately summoned a storm and called down lightning, which promptly electrocuted the giant-killing the villain on the spot. When the curious townsfolk saw the brief, explosive storm nearby, they stopped rebuilding their homes and came to investigate. What they found was a charred giant and a sleepy raiju, nestled amid their stolen rice. Raijus have been considered lucky spirits ever since, though mrefuse to sleep face up during lighting storms lest their bellies seem like a comfortable place for a raiju to rest. Kaenju This rarer variant of the raiju dwells upon the Plane of Fire, in regions filled with smoke and wracked by firestorms and endless volcanic eruptions. Just as their kin from the Plane of Air, kaenjus may visit mundane worlds during volcanic eruptions or when huge fires devastate towns or forests. A kaenju is very similar to its cousin, but its substance is made of fire instead of lightning. Defensive Abilities: Kaenjus have the fire subtype  and resistance 10 to lightning. Special Attacks: A kaenju's tail and claws are considered flaming burst weapons. Special Qualities: All kaenjus' supernatural abilities are based on flame instead of lightning, and have the same effects but deal fire damage instead of electricity damage. Also, instead of a raiju's spell-like abilities, a kaenju can cast produce flame at will, and flaming sphere and quench 3 times per day.",1600
Rakklethorn Toad,1,magical beast,warm marshes,"A cat-sized toad about 3-foot long with dozens of small needle-like thorns protruding from its back, hops forth. Its mottled brown and green skin glistens with a dull sheen, while its gray eyes study knowingly.","Relatives of poisonous toads, rakklethorns live in small packs in murky swamps. Rakklethorn toad packs are fiercely territorial, and battles between them are frequent. Occasionally, however, the rakklethorn toads enter a mating frenzy. Several packs merge and form a great swarm of noisy frogs that sweeps through the marshes like a wave. After a mating frenzy, females release hundreds of jelly-like eggs into the waters. Of all those eggs, only a very small fraction live long enough to hatch into tadpoles. A rakklethorn toad attacks by arching its back and firing a volley of thorns at an opponent. It rarely ever closes to melee, preferring to attack at range. If confronted in close quarters, a rakklethorn toad usually flees or if cornered, attacks with its bite.

Rakshasa,10,outsider,any,"This figure's backward-bending fingers and its bestial, snarling visage leave little doubt as to its fiendish nature.","The rakshasa is an evil spirit that cloaks itself in the guise of a humanoid creature that it might walk unseen among its prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those it seeks to defile, a rakshasa gorges itself on these hideous acts. Were they human, these acts of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells. When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads of great cats  or a snake , yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities. Rakshasas scoff at religion- they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races. Rakshasa clerics are thus quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also very much creatures of the Material Plane, and mbelieve the first rakshasas chose this exile over some other role offered them by a longforgotten god. Although they usually work alone, it isn't unheard of to find extended families of rakshasas working together to ruin a mortal civilization from the inside out over the course of mgenerations. A rakshasa is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs.",9600
Raktavarna,2,outsider,any,"What at first appears to be a bejeweled blade shimmers and writhes, transforming into a hideous, red-eyed serpent.","Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids, but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a serpent's egg. These terrors drift through society, passing from hand to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world, and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees, or  upon the master's death. Little disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master, and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a replacement as soon as they can. A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.",600
Ram,1,animal,"temperate hills, mountains or plains","Curving horns extend from the sides of this sheep's head, giving it a potent butting attack.","The statistics here describe the common sheep and ram. Sheep generally flee from danger and avoid combat if possible. If cornered, they attack by biting. Rams are male sheep and are usually encountered leading a flock. Rams attack using their horns. They become aggressive if the flock is threatened. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Rast,5,outsider,any,"This bulbous creature consists of mtangled legs, a bulging body of puffed flesh, and a mouth filled with sharp fangs.","Hailing from the barren wastes of the Plane of Fire, the rast is as dangerous as it is bizarre. Its body is a single tumorous sack that bulges with hidden organs and veins and bears no sensory apparatus beyond two miniscule eyes almost lost in the folds and wattles of its flesh. Instead, its defining feature is a mouth of flesh-ripping teeth and a wriggling mass of tangled legs. The exact number of legs on a particular rast is seemingly a random trait. Strangely, these tangled limbs do not support the creature, but rather hang twitching and waving beneath it as the rast floats through the air with an easy grace, only reaching out to manipulate objects or-more often-to slash at its prey. Though rasts do not appear to have spoken language, they display a degree of intelligence that places them above mere animals, and use this innate cunning to aid in their hunts. As prey is scarce in the barren, ashy deserts of the Plane of Fire where they make their home, rasts prefer to hunt in packs, swarming through the skies like schools of fish, their movements precise and coordinated despite their thrashing limbs. When they come across a likely target, they descend en masse, paralyzing those foes susceptible to their gaze and then abandoning them temporarily to focus on opponents that remain mobile and dangerous, slashing with their claws and latching on with thick-lipped mouths to suck their victims' blood and viscera. Though each rast has roughly a dozen limbs, it can only control up to four at given time, leaving the others to dangle uselessly. Rasts make their homes in small ashen burrows, no more than holes scooped out by the thrashing of their claws, and bear their squirming young live. An adult rast is the size of a human and weighs 200 pounds. Rasts tend to be red, yellow, or purple, with darker coloration on their legs and heads, the better to blend in with the fiery plains of their homeland. Though most other intelligent species on the Plane of Fire are powerful enough  to avoid direct conf lict with a rast pack, a cluster that stumbles through a portal to the Material Plane  can prove disastrous for the local ecosystem, consuming everything in its path with seemingly no limit to its repulsive hunger.",1600

In such numbers, they become voracious hunters, capable of killing a full-grown human with hundreds of bites. Rat swarms are often found in the sewers of large human settlements. Rat swarms surround and attack warm-blooded prey in their path.",600
Ratfolk,0.33,humanoid,warm deserts or urban,"This small, ratlike humanoid has a twitching, whiskered snout, pointed ears, and a long, leathery tail.","Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids often found traveling in nomadic trading caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies in slums, sewers, and other normally undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers and hoarders by nature, mratfolk are shrewd merchants, carefully navigating the shifting alliances of black markets and bazaars. They love their stockpiles of interesting items far more than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to add to their hoards than for mere coins. Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash their hoards or flee in times of danger, gravitating toward subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in city ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large families and kin networks, as well as with ordinary rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic harmony and fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened. Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They often wear robes to conceal their forms in cities, as they know other humanoids find their rodent features distasteful. RATFOLK CHARACTERS Ratfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All ratfolk have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence: Ratfolk are agile and clever, yet physically weak. Small: Ratfolk are Small and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on CMB and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.

Rodent Empathy: Ratfolk gain a +4 bonus on Handle Animal checks made to inf luence rodents. Swarming: See above. Languages: Ratfolk begin play speaking Common. Ratfolk with high intelligence can choose from of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon",135
Ratling,2,magical beast,urban,"This ratlike creature has tiny human hands in place of its front paws, and an unnerving human face with a toothy mouth.","The rats that dwell in the walls of old edifices or amid the dripping tunnels of crumbling sewers are not always simple animals. At times, the hidden scrabbling of tiny paws comes from sources altogether more sinister and vile. The ratling is a hideous amalgamation of rat and human: a long-haired rodent with front paws that are more accurately called hands, and a face reminiscent of a leering old man. Within the ratling's humanoid mouth can be found long, yellow incisors more akin to those one might find in the jaws of a rat. These teeth are remarkably sharp, and when combined with the blood-thinning qualities in the ratling's saliva, are capable of inf licting particularly dangerous, bleeding wounds. A ratling is just over 2 feet long  and weighs 10 pounds. Ecology Ratlings are carnivores. While they can subsist on prey less able to defend itself, such as grubs, other rodents, and carrion, they much prefer the warm flesh of living food. Children are their preferred meals, not only because such targets are easier to catch and generally safe to chase, but also because the sadistic ratling enjoys the purer sense of fear a screaming child might offer as dinnertime entertainment. The elderly and infirm are also common targets, both because of their lessened ability to defend themselves and simply because older victims are often in high supply in the places ratlings prefer to dwell. A ratling can  mate with normal rats. If the ratling parent is male, the products of such disturbing unions are large and particularly aggressive rats . If the ratling parent is female, she will spawn a litter of a dozen or so young, including one infant ratling, with the remainder being horribly deformed rats. The stronger and deadlier infant ratling generally feeds upon its brothers and sisters. At the very least, it dismembers them and arranges the torn limbs and entrails in strange patterns, as its not-yet-fully-developed sense of the occult and more heinous magical traditions compels it to enact proto-rituals out of necromantic curiosity. Ratlings understand that most larger creatures present a significant danger. In combat, they generally do not remain around long enough for most fights to last more than a round or two. A ratling's preferred tactic is to become invisible, scuttle out to bite a target to gain the advantage of its sneak attack, then scurry away to a safe vantage point so it can, hopefully, watch its bitten victim bleed to death from its wounds. Habitat & Society Ratlings are far smarter than typical rats. On average, their intellect exceeds that of a typical human. As such, ratlings prefer to dwell in areas where their constant thirst for knowledge and boundless curiosity can continuously be quenched. Universities, wizards' guilds, libraries, and the like are the favorite haunts of ratlings. Old manors of families with long traditions of scholastic pursuit are even greater catches, for here, ratlings do not have to contest with increased levels of traffic or interruption. They often pilfer scrolls and books to quench their thirst for knowledge, just as they chase children to quench their thirst for blood. A ratling generally enjoys the compof normal rats. In most cases, the creature is a loner among its own kind, but ratling conclaves are well-documented in the basements and attics of certain particularly old and large repositories of knowledge. These gatherings of ratlings often ape the structure of a typical university, with a group led by the most knowledgeable among the conclave, who serves to direct the ""studies"" of the younger members of the group. These elder ratlings often demand forays into the structure itself, scavenging missions to gather up books and scrolls for further study, but the conclaves are always careful to limit these stolen texts to ones that they observe as having been forgotten or generally unused. Ratlings know that humanoids are dangerous foes, and the longer a ratling conclave can hide its presence in an active building, the better. Ratling elders often advance as clerics, oracles, witches, or wizards; they rarely gain levels as non-spellcasting classes . Ratlings who take witch or wizard levels and have a familiar most often choose rats-an association that often brings with it more than mere supernatural companionship. Although ratlings are capable of gaining improved familiars, they can never select another ratling as a familiar. Ratlings as Familiars While mcreatures might balk at the concept of becoming a familiar, ratlings quite enjoy the role. Not only does being a spellcaster's familiar give a ratling the security of having a powerful guardian who seeks to keep it safe, but also the ratling familiar has all but guaranteed access to texts and scrolls to read and study. Most spellcasters who take on ratlings as familiars also allow the ratlings to sup on their blood, giving their familiars an even greater reason to remain loyal and devoted to their masters or mistresses. A ratling who serves as a familiar gains the ability to use commune once per week as a spell-like ability. A ratling can serve a spellcaster as a familiar if the spellcaster has the Improved Familiar feat. In order to gain a ratling familiar, the spellcaster must be chaotic evil and at least 7th level. A spellcaster with a ratling familiar typically carries numerous scrolls on his person for the ratling to access during combat.",600
Rattler Inphidian,4,monstrous humanoid,warm forests or plains or underground,Ornate diamond shaped patterns cover the flesh of this serpentine horror. The most noticeable feature of his humanoid torso is its arms-they end in snake heads rather than hands. Its snake arms and heads have a distinctive triangular shape with a pit above the nostrils and before the slit-like eyes. This creature has no legs but instead has the lower half of a monstrous rattlesnake complete with a foot long rattle which twitches ominously at the tip.,"Rattler inphidians are one of the more powerful sub-races of inphidians and are often found in leadership roles such as commanders  and tribal leaders . They are wicked killers who care nothing for life, valuing their own survival above anyone else's. This alone would seem to make them poor leaders , but what they lack in compassion for others, they more than make up for with their leadership skills, instincts, and ability to ferret out spies, intruders, trespassers, and others who seek to disrupt the inphidian culture. A rattler inphidian is 6 feet tall and about 8 feet long. It appears as an inphidian with the lower torso of a giant rattlesnake. Colors vary along the spectrum but most are brown, black, or dark gray with bands and diamond-shaped patterns covering its entire body. Like all inphidians, its hands are non-existent, a viper head being in its place. A rattler's eyes, as well as the eyes on its snake-hands are an iridescent red. Cool calculating observers of their foes, rattlers are intelligent enough to pick their battles and fight only at a time and place of their own choosing. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, a rattler attempts to save itself, even using its allies as fodder if necessary. In combat, a rattler relies on its physical attacks and death rattle to vanquish its foes. A particular nasty tactic of a rattler is to paralyze a foe with its poison and then leave it to bake in the hot deserts sun. Rattler Inphidian Characters +8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +4 Charisma. Base Speed: A rattler inphidian's base land speed is 30 feet.

Rawbones,8,undead,land,"Skulking towards you is what appears to be a freshly skinned and cleaned corpse. It is a bloody, skeletal creature with bits of flesh and muscle still clinging to its wet bones. Its entrails and organs hang loosely in its torso, sometimes even dropping out entirely. Its eyes roll about in its eye sockets as it seeks its prey.","A rawbones is an undead creature that comes into being when a tortured person rises from the grave. Rawbones are commonly found in ancient dungeons that hold old torture chambers and prison cells. Some are also found haunting the local cemeteries where a tortured person was laid to rest. While disgusting in appearance, there is something in the magic  of a rawbones that keeps it looking ‘fresher' that most of its other undead kin. Like mundead, rawbones despise the living and seek to harm such creatures whenever they can. A rawbones is generally a solitary creature though it is possible more than one could be encountered together . A rawbones stands 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 140 pounds. Its bones are stained red with fresh blood which seems to continually weep from the creature's body. Bits of flesh and muscle fall away from it as it moves about and its entrails often drag the ground behind it or are wrapped around the creature's forearms. A rawbones speaks Common and at least one other language. A rawbones attacks primarily with its powerful fists, but it has other weapons at its disposal. It can vomit forth a horrifying spray of blood and gore or use its entrails as a ranged weapon which it loops around an opponent's neck in an attempt to strangle it. While battling its foes, it attempts to keep them within range of its nauseating aura. A rawbones' natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Red Jester,10,undead,any,"A horrid walking corpse appears, arrayed in brightly colored clothes, floppy shoes, and a bright red jester's hat complete with jingling bells sewn to the ends of the cap. The rigor mortis seems to have permanently pulled the creature's face into a broad and horrific grin.","Red jesters are thought to be the undead form of court jesters having been put to death for telling bad jokes, making fun of the local ruler, or dying in an untimely manner . Another legend speaks of the red jesters as being the court jesters of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, sent to the Material Plane to ""entertain"" those the demon prince has chosen to pay special attention to. The actual truth to their origin remains a mystery. While they can be encountered from the coldest to the warmest regions of the world and on type of terrain, a red jester is generally encountered near civilized areas. Though it is dead  now, it still delights in entertaining living creatures through its humor and obviously cannot do that if it resides far away in unsettled lands. Some red jesters, in an effort to disguise their undead nature don masks or wear makeup. Red jesters speak Common and at least two other languages and often engage in humor during combat, spilling bad puns and riddles at their opponents. A red jester opens combat using its fear cackle attempting to affect as mopponents as possible. Those that resist its effects are assailed with its magical playing cards and mace. During the entire combat, the red jester talks, laughs, and tells jokes and riddles. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600
Red Wyrm Ravener,22,undead,warm mountains,"This immense skeletal dragon rears up to its full, towering height, bones glowing and shimmering with vile green energy.","Most evil dragons spend their lifetimes coveting and amassing wealth, but when the end draws near, some come to realize that all the wealth in the world cannot forestsall death. Faced with this truth, most dragons vent their frustration on the countryside, ravaging the world before their passing. Yet some seek a greater solution to the problem and decide instead to linger on, hoarding life as they once hoarded gold. These foul wyrms attract the attention of dark powers, and through the blackest of necromantic rituals are transformed into undead dragons known as raveners. Although its body quickly rots away, a ravener does not care for the needs of the flesh. It seeks only to consume life, be it from wild animals, would-be dragonslayers, or even other dragons. A ravener is often on the move, changing lairs frequently as its territories become devoid of life. The ravener presented here is built from a red dragon wyrm. See page 98 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for rules on this monster's fire aura, manipulate flames, melt stone, and smoke vision abilities. Creating a Ravener ""Ravener"" is an acquired template that can be added to evil true dragon of an age category of ancient or older . A ravener retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. It keeps subtypes possessed by the base creature. Senses: A ravener's darkvision increases to 240 feet, and its blindsense increases to 120 feet. Armor Class: A ravener gains a def lection bonus to its AC equal to half its Charisma bonus . Hit Dice: Change all of the base creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As an undead, a ravener uses its Charisma to determine bonus hit points instead of its Constitution. Saving Throws: As undead, a ravener uses its Charisma modifier on Fortitude saves . Defensive Abilities: A ravener gains channel resistance +4 and all of the immunities derived from undead traits. Its damage reduction changes from DR/magic to DR/ good. A ravener also gains the following ability. Soul Ward : An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a ravener from destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal to twice the ravener's Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is destroyed. Attacks: A ravener retains all of the natural attacks of the base creature, but each of these attacks threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Feats like Improved Critical can increase this range further. If the ravener scores a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target gains 1 negative level. The DC to remove this negative level is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener's Hit Dice + the ravener's Charisma modifier. Whenever a creature gains a negative level in this way, the ravener adds 5 points to its soul ward. Special Attacks: A ravener retains all of the special attacks of the base creature and gains the following special attacks as described below. All save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener's HD + the ravener's Charisma modifier. Breath Weapon : A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature- the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based. In addition, a ravener's breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the area. A successful Ref lex save halves the damage and reduces the energy drain to 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the ravener's breath weapon DC. The ravener adds 1 hit point to its soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way. Cowering Fear : Any creature shaken by the ravener's frightful presence is cowering instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken for the rest of the duration. Any creature that is frightened by its frightful presence is instead cowering for the duration. Soul Consumption : When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener dies, that creature's soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener's maw if the dying creature fails a Will save . This adds a number of hit points to the ravener's soul ward equal to the dead creature's Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed in this way can only be brought back to life through miracle, true resurrection, or wish. Soul Magic : A ravener retains the base creature's spellcasting capability, adding three levels to the base creature's caster level. This increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots. Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast one of its spells known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot level necessary to cast the spell . If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener . Abilities: Str +4, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6. Being undead, a ravener has no Constitution score. Skills: A ravener has a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks. The ravener's class skills are otherwise the same as those of the base creature.",409600
Redcap,6,fey,"temperate forests, mountains, or underground","Like some miniscule, wicked old man, this snarling little humanoid wears metal boots and a blood-red pointed cap.","Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful bloodletting and self-indulgent slaughter. Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both fear and spectacle.

Reefclaw,1,aberration,waters,"Blood-red spines run the length of this frightening creature, which resembles a lobster in the front and an eel in the back.","Reefclaws are vicious predators. They possess greater intelligence than animals, but rely mainly on their strength and instincts to survive. They hunt fish, giant crabs, dolphins, and even land-dwelling creatures that come within a hundred paces of the waters. In populated areas, reefclaws prey on beachcombers, divers, and fishermen, sometimes abandoning their usual solitary nature and coordinating attacks with other reefclaws. The creatures must be wary, however, because in some regions, these abominations find their way to the dinner plate. Brave fishermen troll bays and coastlines infested with reefclaws, baiting the creatures with fresh meat and then harvesting their powerful claws with axes. Reefclaws cannot speak, but the creatures understand the languages used by humanoids near their hunting grounds. They use this knowledge in order to avoid fishermen and coordinate attacks. Reefclaws keep no treasure, instead savoring the taste of flesh and crunch of bone and shell as much as a miser covets his gold. A typical reefclaw reaches approximately 3-1/2 feet long at adulthood and weighs 70 pounds. Females gather to breed once every 2 to 3 years, engaging in a predatory hunt for a male and leaving him shredded to pieces.",400

Remorhaz,7,magical beast,cold deserts or glaciers,"An immense centipede-like beast erupts from the snow, rows of chitinous plates on its back glowing red-hot.","In a world of ice and snow, the remorhaz is particularly feared for the terrible fires that burn within its body. These internal fires cause the armor plates along its back to glow red-hot when the creature is particularly angry, excited, or in pain. Creatures adapted to arctic regions are often particularly vulnerable to fire, making the remorhaz's primary defense an incredibly potent one and securing its role as a dangerous predator in such frozen reaches. Remorhazes dwell in extensive warrens carved into the hearts of glaciers. The beasts use their heat to melt tunnels through ice, tunnels whose smooth glassy sides swiftly refreeze in their wake to create uncommonly stable and numerous mazes. Although the remorhaz has much in common superficially with lesser vermin, the beast is surprisingly intelligent. While not capable of speech, the typical remorhaz has a good grasp of the Giant tongue, and tribes of giants often use this to their advantage to secure allegiances with the great beasts. Frost giants are particularly obsessed with them, for those giants who brave the cruel and deadly burns a remorhaz can inf lict to become ""worm friends"" gain a potent weapon to use against their enemies-an assassin capable of burrowing up through the floor of a glacial keep to strike directly against a frost giant's greatest weakness: fire. Other giants use the beasts as living forges, for their backs are hot enough to melt metal. A remorhaz is 25 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.",3200
Renzer,6,magical beast,temperate or warm waters,"A massive, grayish-white shark-like creature swims forth.

Its shark-like pectoral fins end in three-fingered claws and it has two dorsal fins, side-by-side. Its tail fins curve sharply and are a bit lighter in color than the rest of its body.","The deadly renzer roams the seas and oceans preying on fish, waters plants, and very often- travelers that enter its domain. Thought to be the result of a wizard's deadly experiment gone awry, the renzer hates most other forms of life and attacks them on sight. Renzer are a malevolent and vile race and care little for anyone one, including others of their kind. They are solitary, selfish creatures that derive great pleasure from killing other creatures, and so they spend a large amount of time hunting prey; sometimes for food, other times for the thrill of the hunt. Most intelligent races avoid the renzer, but some have actually in recent times opened trade with these creatures. Certain colonies of sahuagin trade goods and services with them, though the deals prove shaky at best. Even the sahuagin don't really like or trust the renzer. A renzer usually initiates combat with its spell-like abilities, using a cone of cold to blast its foes. In melee combat, a renzer focuses on bite attacks and once it locks its teeth on an opponent, it rarely lets go until either it or its opponent is dead. If fighting a surface-dwelling race or air-breathing creature, a renzer often grabs the opponent and dives straight down, swimming as fast as it can in hopes of drowning the foe. If outnumbered or overwhelmed, the renzer moves a safe distance away and uses its command fish ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400
Requiem Beetle,18,vermin,warm mountains or underground,"This massive beetle has a dark red carapace, blackish-red wing covers, and black legs. Two large claw-like pincers protrude from its front slashing and ripping the very air around the creature. Its oversized mandibles are dark reddish-black.","Requiem beetles are beetles of enormous size reaching lengths of 100 feet or more. They make their lairs in remote mountains regions or deep underground in massive caverns. A typical lair contains a solitary creature . Mating and reproduction rituals and methods among requiem beetles are unknown to sages, though it is generally accepted that requiem beetles follow other similar beetle and vermin mating patterns. These monsters sustain themselves on a diet of mosses, funguses, lichens, molds, and oozes. Their natural immunity to acid allows them to kill and digest most oozes without bother. Requiem beetles are mindless hunters, like other vermin, and simply kill and eat whatever they come across. When they deplete an area of its food source they simply move to another location. Requiem beetles measure about 40 feet long and weigh about 18 tons. A requiem beetle charges into combat attempting to trample as mof its opponents as it can. It uses its massive pincers in battle to cut and tear its opponents or grab and squeeze them. Once a requiem beetle grabs a foe it rarely lets go until either it or the opponent is dead. If forced to flee, a requiem beetle does not release its prey, but instead, carries it off with it. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",153600
Retch Hound,3,magical beast,temperate forests or marshes,"This large, muscular dog has sickly brownish-yellow fur, matted or torn in places. Small sores cover its body, each oozing a thick, yellowishgreen liquid. Its mouth is filled with long pointed yellow teeth, some broken off on the ends. Most disturbingly, it has four large yellow eyes evenly aligned across its canine head.","Retch hounds are large, yellowish, sickly-looking hounds, about the size of war dogs. They are highly aggressive and powerfully built carnivores that love the taste of human flesh and bones. Their appearance lends to the façade of a sickly dog, which sometimes works to the retch hound's advantage when hunting its prey. Retch hounds are often found in the service of powerful fighters and warriors, who use the dogs to guard prisoners, lead hunting expeditions, and perform other such services. A retch hound is only as loyal to its master as it has to be to insure its own survival. While the dog won't necessary seek escape at the earliest possible time, it often turns on its master at some point. Retch hounds raised in captivity are often more loyal to their masters than those captured in the wild. A typical retch hound stands 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 150 pounds. Retch hounds hunt their prey in packs. Using an eerie howl, they seem to coordinate and communicate with one another during these hunts. A favored tactic of a retch hound pack is to encircle a foe and then hit it from all sides at once. Usually the largest hound in the pack is the leader. When slain, a retch hound melts into a pile of stinking and bubbling slime. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Retriever,11,construct,any,"A spider the size of a bull elephant rears up on its back four legs in a violent challenge, eyes shimmering with magical energy.","Not all constructs are formed from unliving matter like stone, wood, metal, or dead flesh. In the darkest corners of the Great Beyond, certain powerful demon lords have mastered the art of shaping the raw, protoplasmic flesh of the Abyss into hideous monstrosities devoid of life, emotion, and the will to resist control. The monstrous retriever is the best-known of such constructs, a huge spider-like creation capable of unleashing potent energy upon those it has been ordered to seek. Demon lords use retrievers to seek out those who dare abandon their loyalties or flee from servitude. Often, the presence of a retriever in a demon's den is enough in and of itself to ensure the loyalty of the lesser demons. The constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects and returning them to their masters-their intelligence is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of rebellion and longings for freedom. A retriever's body is the size of an elephant, and its legspan is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 6,500 pounds. Conjuring a Retriever Although a retriever is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either greater planar ally or greater planar binding. The spellcaster must take care to do so, however, using special rare incenses and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls using expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the retriever attack the spellcaster upon completion of the spell. These components cost 25,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell .",12800

Rhamphorhynchus,0.33,animal,warm coastlines or forests,"A brightly colored creature swoops down to land on the branch above. Its head is overly large, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and bright, shiny eyes. The thing chirps, lashes its long thin tail, and then with a flap of leathery wings is in the air once again.","Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves. The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines, along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet consists of fish snatched from the waters in daring dives. Pterosaurs are quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss, shriek, and attack things their size or larger. Rhamphorhynchus This pterosaur is a quick-moving reptile with a 5-foot wingspan, a narrow snout filled with dozens of needle-like teeth, and a long tail tipped with an arrowheadshaped ridge. Males are generally quite brightly colored, displaying brilliant reds, greens, and bright blues, often bearing complex patterns like stripes; females tend to be more drably colored. Although tiny, the rhamphorhynchus is swift and aggressive, and its attack method of swooping down suddenly to attack creatures allows it to bite with increased damage and ferocity. At the end of a sudden swoop, a rhamphorhynchus is typically at a disadvantage, and most won't stick around to keep fighting in melee, instead taking to the air once more to gain enough height to swoop again in a few rounds. Their tiny size, erratic flight patterns, and swift ref lexes make them difficult to affect with area effects. A pterosaur on the ground walks in a quadrupedal gait; the tips of its wings arc up alongside its body, while its lower torso remains closer to the ground than its shoulders and head as it moves. Rhamphorhynchus Familiars Rhamphorhynchuses  make excellent familiars for spellcasters who are looking for a quick and nimble minion. A rhamphorhynchus familiar grants its master all of the typical benefits familiars grant, but their jittery and quick reactions also impart a +2 bonus on the master's Initiative checks. A rhamphorhynchus is generally too small to serve well as an animal companion- if a character wishes to take one as a companion anyway, they have the same statistics as bird animal companions.",135

Rift Drake,9,dragon,warm hills or mountains,"Horns jut from this muscular dragon's beaked head, and spikes cover the dragon's hide even in places on its winged arms.","Creatures of the badlands and regions scarred by the gods, rift drakes are as savage and brutal as the lands they hunt. Their strength and savagery often make them seem like mere deadly beasts, but rift drakes simply delight in battle more than most drakes, frequently clashing even with other members of their own kind. They rarely deign to talk with other creatures, often doing so only as a cruel game in which they make more and more outrageous demands until their victims realize the drakes are toying with them or the manipulative drakes grow bored. A rift drake rarely stays on land for long, preferring to circle high above near ominous peaks or spires and roosting in the crevices of the same. When a rift drake spies prey from such heights, it breaks from its flight to dive onto victims, scattering groups and sowing terror with its sudden emergence. With particularly agile foes, a rift drake will use its breath to slow victims first, then pick them off one by one. Rift drakes enjoy the taste of blood, and focus their attacks on the fleshiest-looking creatures. A rift drake is around 14 feet long, end to end. Its burly, spiky body weighs about 2,500 pounds.",6400
Riptide Horror,8,magical beast,temperate marshes,"This vile, grayish-tan tubeworm is longer than a man. It has six eyeless heads and each mouth is lined with inward curving, serrated teeth. Six long grayish-tan tentacles protrude from the middle of its body.","The terrifying riptide horror is a giant, sightless tubeworm found in sea caves or deep within desolate marshes. They are carnivorous creatures and have a voracious appetite that is only sated with meat, preferably that of warm-blooded humanoids or reptiles. Opportunistic, ambush hunters, riptide horrors wait for prey to come to them. They can go several weeks without eating, and sometimes do, but if a meal is readily available, the horror does not hesitate to kill and devour it. Such a meal is placed in a ""reserve"" stomach-like sac. When the food supply is low, the riptide horror delves into its reserve and draws sustenance from the stored food. Riptide horrors mate once a year, usually in flooded sea caves. The female crawls into the male's lair and deposits a sticky, greenish-tan mass of eggs on the wall of the cave. The male fertilizes the eggs and in 4 months, the eggs begin to hatch. Juveniles are excellent swimmers and leave the cave as soon as they hatch. As a riptide horror ages, its body secretes a substance that forms a shell-like carapace on its dorsal side. Riptide horrors prefer to attack from ambush; sitting unmoving until potential prey moves within range. Often, they use their spider climb ability to cling to sea cave walls where their unsuspecting prey walks underneath them. Once prey wanders too close, the riptide horror lashes out with its tentacles and attempts to grab its meal. Grabbed foes are subjected to its paralytic poison and are bitten by its razor-sharp teeth. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",4800
River Drake,3,dragon,temperate rivers or lakes,"With graceful wings and wide fins, this sleek dragon looks equally well equipped to glide through sea and skies.","Preying upon fish and fishermen with equal ease, rivers drakes are scourges of freshwaters expanses. They are thought to be related to black dragons, as evidenced by their acidic spit, waters affinity, viciousness, and preference for rotten meat. Like other drakes, rivers drakes are cruel hunters, using a play-and-prey hunting style. When not hungry, they amuse themselves by stalking and harassing other creatures and travelers. An offering of treasure thrown into the waters can distract a rivers drake, but such a bribe is unlikely to stave off a particularly hungry individual. rivers drakes often slay more than they can immediately eat because they favor aged meat, keeping underwaters larders stuffed with kills in various stages of decay. A rivers drake is a crafty, careful hunter that uses its watersy home to provide concealment from creatures on the shore. If caught unawares while on land, it retreats to the waters, or takes to flight if its enemies are prepared for waters combat, making constant use of its caustic mucus and great speed. rivers drakes are much more likely to hunt in groups than most other drakes, threatening rivers traffic or assaulting lakesfront or riverside towns if their numbers are large enough. However, these disorganized raids are quick to retreat from hint of significant resistance. rivers drakes are 8 feet long and look much like small sea drakes. An adult rivers drake weighs about 700 pounds.",800
rivers Elk,2,animal,cold or temperate plains,"This majestic beast stands the height of a man at its shoulders, a many-tipped rack of proud antlers crowning its head.","Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of mwildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove important parts of mecologies, being able to fend off or flee mthreats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Mhumanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the rivers elk seen throughout the rivers Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide. In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources. Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against mwould-be attackers. Most breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, mhumanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as mas 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise  it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the rivers Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, rivers elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter waters, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forestsed areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.

Roc,9,animal,warm mountains,"This immense raptor unleashes a shrill cry as it bares its talons, each large enough to carry off a horse.","Rocs are terrifying, legendary birds renowned for their ability to carry off elephants and other big animals. A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80- foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc. Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3-5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest. Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged. A roc can be trained as well as other animal, but its great size makes this a daunting task for most would-be trainers of human size. The same isn't true for giants-particularly cloud and storm giants, who often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most prestigious of giants. Rocs taken as animal companions by druids or rangers are typically newly hatched birds-a baby roc is the size of a person and ready for flight and hunting within minutes of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc is limited to Large size-still large enough for a Medium druid or ranger to use the flying beast as a mount.

Rokurokubi,14,monstrous humanoid,ruins,"This human-sized woman is dressed in simple peasant clothing. From her shoulders sprouts a grotesquely long neck that coils about like a snake, and razor-sharp teeth fill her gaping maw.","Rokurokubis are evil, sorcerous humanoids with malevolent origins and even viler intentions. Always taking the form of women, rokurokubis seek to spread as much mayhem and despair as possible, using their wicked magic to ruin lives, tear families apart, and at worst, maim and murder innocents. Such monsters make their homes within civilized societies and disguise themselves as simple commoners, but they take the form of monstrous hags with serpentine throats during the night , and delight in the taste and feeling of warm blood running down their gullets. At first glance, a rokurokubi looks much like ordinary human woman. Upon closer inspection, however, her frail appearance and sickly hued skin begin to hint at the being's true nature. When a rokurokubi reveals her monstrous ability to stretch her neck to inhuman lengths or begins to weave her arcane sorcery, there can be no doubt as to her sheer otherworldliness. When she wills it, a rokurokubi may snake her long, rubbery neck up to 20 feet from her body. Down the length of this otherwise smooth, fleshy appendage, evenly spaced vertebrae show as sickening knobbles, lending further grotesqueness to the creature's already disturbing appearance. While most prefer to utilize their dark magic to devastate enemies from the shadows, rokurokubis are far from helpless when forced to face foes head-on, and can be exceptionally canny combatants if cornered, using their long necks to deliver devastating bites to short-limbed foes at a distance. The aura of darkness and silence that surrounds a rokurokubi makes combating the fiend difficult for creatures that rely on melee attacks to damage or disable their foes but lack the ability to see in the dark. When her neck is not distended from her body, a rokurokubi is 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ecology Rokurokubis' wan skin ranges in hue from pale blue to muted green, and thus most cover up their flesh with makeup or wear concealing robes and gowns to disguise their identities. Their gnarly hands and fingers are perhaps the most difficult traits to hide, and thus mrokurokubis take to wearing loose-fitting gloves or clothes with oversized sleeves to mask their hands while in public. They use their bites in combat to gruesome effect, and their jagged teeth are like the creatures' necks in that they can be shortened and lengthened at will. Rokurokubis are born and raised by their mothers. In order to reproduce, a rokurokubi must seek an unsuspecting humanoid male as her partner, though she may also occasionally copulate with more monstrous creatures-race matters not to a rokurokubi, whose savage and rapacious nature knows no bounds. Regardless of her partner's race, the offspring of a rokurokubi is always a rokurokubi, and rarely do such monstrous children bear resemblance to the father, instead acquiring almost all their features from the mother who bore them, though they undoubtedly carry a spark of the father's nature within them as well, usually manifesting as odd quirks or obsessions with particular hobbies or activities. A rokurokubi's sire rarely has the chance to see his child come into being anyway, however, as the man is usually slain immediately after he has fulfilled his purpose and his vile partner has tired of his presence. A rokurokubi's bizarre anatomy allows her to carry a child without her belly broadening noticeably, and she can even host multiple children of different fathers simultaneously, though with a third or fourth simultaneous pregnancy she does begin to show signs of fatigue as well as a widening girth, her already fragile body pushed to its absolute limits. Unlike most other monstrous humanoids, rokurokubis have no need for sleep, and are thus immune to magical effects that would cause them to do such. Nonetheless, they understand that other creatures require such rest and utilize this weakness, shaping their magic to render victims unconscious, at which point they cause their targets further harm in the form of relentless nightmares. As most other creatures sleep at night, rokurokubis prey upon unsuspecting victims during this time more than other. Habitat & Society Rokurokubis tend to make their homes in dark, dank, secret places, far from settlements and the activities of what they deem to be lesser races. Caves, long-forgotten burial mounds, and desertsed or crumbling homesteads are all likely hideouts for these dangerous creatures. Solitary creatures by nature, rokurokubis leave their mothers shortly after they are old enough to survive on their own. When they do congregate, they usually do so only to execute complex, sinister plans that would be impossible to enact by themselves. Rokurokubis' affinity with the night and their unusual physiology make them natural rogues and hunters, apt as they are at peering around corners and through windows as well as trapping victims in clouds of inky blackness and silence. While some rokurokubis seek no allegiances and only wish to kill for the sheer sport of it, others see the advantages in forming tentative alliances and making themselves available as assassins and spies, and thus sell their services to those foolish or desperate enough to seek them out. The cost of such a monstrous mercenary is usually exorbitant; rokurokubis have been known to strike deals with those customers who can't afford to pay them but who still entice them with a particularly interesting or challenging job. Such bargains are usually for something even more valuable to the asker than money, often something tangible such as a first-born son or daughter , ashes of a loved one, or even one or more of the hirer's limbs. Those who refuse such offers are met with either amused indifference or unforgiving hatred, the latter almost inevitably resulting in the offender's immediate death.",38400
Ronus,2,magical beast,temperate forests,"A horrific creature steps forth, its body that of a great gray wolf and its head resembling a tremendous falcon covered with light brown feathers. It sits poised to pounce, gnashing its great black, razor-sharp beak.","When the sound of a falcon's shriek and a wolf's howl mixed together pierce the night air, chances are good that a solitary or pack of ronus are nearby and just about to strike. Turning and running only incites the pack for they know that no normal creature can outrun them . Ronus always hunt in large packs. A solitary encounter with a ronus is almost unheard of. In such events, the creature encountered is most certainly injured, sick, or old. Such a creature will not attack, unless provoked and only fights to defend itself. Ronus live by hunting and are carnivorous monsters. They will eat just about anything from mice to rabbits to goblins to ogres; anything they can catch and kill. Prey is attacked quickly and dispersed as quickly as possible before it has a chance to get its bearings and mount an attack against the ronus pack. Kills are eaten where they fall. The pack ravenously devours most of the meat, but do not pick the bones clean. Area scavengers appreciate this and some actually follow a ronus pack waiting for its chance to eat. Ronus packs build their lairs in hard to find areas and often use leaves, fallen trees, and broken tree limbs to camouflage the lair. Ronus are social creatures and a lair typically contains 1-4 packs. If young are present, there will be 2d4 of them; they are noncombatants. Ronus are fast and use their quickness to their advantage when hunting. They often sight their prey from a great distance and rely on their closing speed to catch it before it notices the ronus and has a chance to flee. Prey that tries to escape is run down; very few creatures can outrun a hungry ronus. These creatures also use ""flush"" tactics to force prey into a trap. For example, a pack may chase their prey for a short distance before most of the pack seems to break off and give up. One or two continue pursuit, forcing the prey to turn this way or that way; in essence, forcing the prey to go the way the ronus want it to go. Prey that fall for this tactic often wind up face-to-face with the rest of the ronus pack. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Rope Golem,5,construct,any,This construct is a tangled mess of knotted and bundled ropes in roughly humanoid form.,"Rope golems are constructed from mintertwined and knotted ropes and often serve as guardians to lesser nobles, wizards, clerics, and the like, protecting a treasure hoard or some ancient knowledge best kept hidden. The typical rope golem stands 7 feet tall but weighs only about 100 pounds or so. Its long, gangly arms end in noose-like hands. A rope golem can expand its shape to fill a 10-foot area or contract its form to fill a space less than 2 1/2 feet square. Until it is activated, a rope golem appears to be nothing more than a pile of normal ropes. Rope golems cannot communicate. Rope golems attack by rolling their ropey appendages into ""fists"" and pummeling a foe. If a rope golem hits, it attempts to slip its noose-like hands over its opponent's head and around its neck. If successful, a rope golem often maintains the hold until it is destroyed or its opponent is dead. Construction A rope golem's body is spun and tied from 200 pounds of rope.

Roper,12,aberration,underground,"A huge eye opens in this conical creature's front, just above a toothy mouth. Long strands of fibrous material whip from its sides.","The roper is an ambush hunter. Capable of altering the coloration and shape of its body, a roper in hiding looks remarkably like a stalagmite of stone or ice . In areas without such features to hide among, a roper can compress its body into a much more squat, boulder-like shape. The strands it extrudes are not flesh but a thick, semiliquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and sap strength. The roper can manipulate these strands with great finesse, and can fling them as far as 50 feet to snatch objects that attract its attention. Although alien and monstrous in shape, the roper is in fact one of the most intelligent denizens of the deep caverns of the world. They do not form large societies , but often congregate in small clusters. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the finer points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, a roper's appetite always wins out over its intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper's wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.",19200
Rorkoun,6,aberration,temperate marshes or underground,"A large amber eye tops a swollen head, surrounded evenly by four mouths loaded with needle-sharp teeth. This enormously long, yet slender creature stretches the length of five men and appears to be composed of twisted strands of pallid flesh and veiny musculature. The tentacle-like thing moves with the awkward, alien speed of a hunting insect, unnaturally still one moment and darting forth with incredible speed the next.","Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and watersways. Known as ""wretch worms"" and ""eyes of Orv,"" these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there. Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds. Ecology Little is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on waters. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the waters-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. Rorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature's surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs , and capture their prey. Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the waters is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the waters as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings  manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike anything known to the denizens of Golarion's surface-and must hunger endlessly. Habitat & Society Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface. Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind-despite the creatures' tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures' camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey's allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun's benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations-just as they do most creatures- goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration. Occasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.",2400

A time elemental is a powerful creature formed of pure time and matter such as is unknown to even the most learned of sages. It is unknown how or why time elementals enter the Material Plane, as they cannot be summoned using the standard summoning spells.

Given power to command and magically control other giants, the rune giants themselves served their even more powerful masters, and in so doing granted ancient empires armies of giants to command.

Rune Guardian,1,construct,any,"A carved rune detaches itself from the wall and floats silently in midair, glowing with arcane energy.","Rune guardians are animated constructs from ancient Thassilon, created by the runelords to guard laboratories, ossuaries, and repositories of lore. Each rune guardian is dedicated to one of the seven rewards of rule , and empowered with that sin's associated school of magic. As such, there are seven varieties of rune guardian, each recognizable by its shape-that of the Thassilonian rune representing that specific sin and arcane school. . Unlike golems, rune guardians are intelligent, able to follow complex orders and pursue intruders. They were built to coordinate with other servants of the runelords-for example, an envy guardian's hold portal ability is more dangerous when used to lock someone in a room with a servitor monster. A rune guardian is approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighs around 10 pounds. Variant Rune Guardians The statistics presented above represent only the least specimen created by the ancient runelords, with the power of a single 1st-level spell. Other variants exist, with different spell-like abilities or ones of increasing magical power. Rune guardians are always tied to one school of magic, and all of a rune guardian's spelllike abilities must come from that school. For example, a rune guardian of wrath might cast magic missile or shocking grasp instead of burning hands. In addition to the spell-like ability listed above, more powerful rune guardians of gluttony might possess the ability to cast blindness/deafness or ray of exhaustion.

Runeslave hills Giant,8,humanoid,any,"This lumbering giant has a strange, vacant expression, as well as a large glowing rune carved into its flesh.","The ageless monuments and awesome cities of Thassilon rose upon the backs of countless slaves, but none bore the sin-poisoned civilization's burden more than the giants. Able to perform the work of dozens of human slaves, Thassilon's titanic servants-hills giants, stone giants, taiga giants, and others-crafted marvels nigh unparalleled in era before or since, and shaped the face of what is now modern Varisia. Yet as viciously as the runelords worked their slaves and for all they demanded, the giant-crafted marvels were not enough. And thus, working the corrupt rune magic that was theirs alone, the runelords manufactured a damning curse and laid it over their most tireless and effective workers, and in so doing created a new breed of servant: the runeslave. Numerous severe-looking runes spark and flicker upon a runeslave's body, seemingly seared into the creature's flesh. One of the runes is larger and more prominent than the others-this is always one of the runes of Thassilonian magic. Although a runeslave's mind is dulled, its muscles bulge grotesquely, as if barely contained beneath a thin layer of skin, and such behemoths move with unnatural agility for creatures of their ponderous size. Note that while the runeslave template does make a giant more powerful , few, if giants would seek to gain a runeslave's powers. Despite the advantages the runeslave gains, what it loses in free will and longevity typically vastly outweigh the benefits. In combat, a runeslave is deadly and terrifying, but in life, the condition is rightly feared among giants as a devastating and debilitating curse. Creating a Runeslave ""Runeslave"" is an acquired template that can be added to giant . A runeslave uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +1. DEFENSIVE ABILITIES: A runeslave becomes immune to fear effects, exhaustion, and fatigue. In addition, all runeslaves gain the following additional defensive ability. Resist Pain : Runeslaves can continue to function even after taking great punishment. They are immune to nonlethal damage. Against effects that inf lict pain , a runeslave gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws. WEAKNESSES: Runeslaves gain the following weakness. Arcane Decay : The symbols etched upon a runeslave's body put great stress on its physical form, choking its mind and ultimately killing the giant in time. Each runeslave has a predominant Thassilonian rune associated with one school of magic inscribed on its body. Traditionally, this rune is of a school of magic directly opposed to the runelord the runeslave serves- all of the runeslaves encountered in this adventure bear the sign of wrath upon their bodies as a sort of brand of shame. The slow decay of a runeslave's mental faculties manifests as a gradual loss of life and sanity, represented by the accumulation of rune-shaped scars all over the body. The disease has no additional physical or mental effect until these magical runescars completely overwhelm their host, at which point the accumulated pain the giant has endured since becoming a runeslave is released in a fatal surge of unleashed suffering. All runeslaves are ""infected"" with this disease. Only limited wish, miracle, or wish can prevent or cure arcane decay, but in so doing removes the entire template, reverting the runeslave back to the base creature. Multiple successful Fortitude saves only delay the decay and do not cure the creature of the disease. Arcane Decay: Inherited-non-contagious; save Fortitude DC 15; frequency 1/week; effect gain one runescar; cure none . When a runeslave's number of runescars equals its Hit Dice, it dies. SPEED: A runeslave's base land speed is 20 feet faster than the base creature's. Other forms of movement, such as flying or swim speeds, are unaffected. SPECIAL ATTACKS: A runeslave gains the following special attack. Arcane Surge : Once per day as a swift action, a runeslave can gain the benefits of the spell haste for 6 rounds. Using this ability forces the giant to make an additional Fortitude save against arcane decay, even if it has already made its weekly save to resist the disease. ABILITIES: Change from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +2, Int -2, Wis -2, Cha -2. FEATS: Runeslaves gain Diehard and Toughness as bonus feats. The Runeslave Curse As the act of turning their giant servants into runeslaves swept across Thassilon, each of the seven runelords came to employ the corruptive magic in various ways. While in most of the runelords' holdings the giants merely continued to serve as expendable labor, in Bakrakhan, Runelord Alaznist incorporated runeslaves into her vast armies, using them as living siege engines. In Cyrusian, the domain of Pride, Runelord Xanderghul used the magic as a punishment upon slave who garnered his fickle ire. While the magic used to create runeslaves resided almost exclusively in the hands of the runelords, the number of giant slaves they deemed would benefit from this ultimately fatal ""improvement"" far exceeded the rulers' ability to transform. Thus, a number of different methods of creating runeslaves were created, each originating in a separate domain but eventually spreading throughout the empire. ANCIENT RITE: In the Grand Sybaritum of Xin- Haruka, Runelord Krune grew weary of cursing filthy giant after filthy giant, and so devised a method to transform hundreds of his slaves at a time. Summoning whole legions of his giants before him, Krune called down the might of the rune goddess Lissala and cursed his slaves en masse, sending countless faithful slaves to their doom. MINDERHAL'S CURSE: Minderhal's worship was never more prevalent than during the height of the Thassilonian empire, and as such, fear of his displeasure was a motivating force among the giants of that era. Legend held that Minderhal himself was involved in the creation of the first runeslaves, and that in a fit of anger at his giant worshipers, he granted humans the secrets of creating runeslaves. Regardless of this legend's veracity, there have been several cases of particularly blasphemous giants spontaneously transforming into runeslaves, supposedly as punishment from their god. POISONING: In Edasseril, the domain of envy, the alchemists of Runelord Belimarius's vile and sprawling laboratories discovered a way to turn arcane decay into a toxin, allowing the disease to be delivered via poison. The poisoners never did find a way to cure the crippling madness caused by the poison-the toxin's high cost and the frustrating requirement of having to cure the giant's Wisdom drain before it could be put to work kept this poison from seeing greater use. Runeslave Poison: Poison-ingested; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect confusion for 1 round and 1d4 Wisdom drain ; cure 3 consecutive saves; cost 10,000 gp. RUNESLAVE CAULDRON: Brought forth from Gastash, the domain of gluttony, these massive cauldrons were large enough to fit an adult stone giant and infused with necromantic energies. Any giant placed in a cauldron and then slain is immediately resurrected as a runeslave-see page 424 for further details on these sadistic magic items.",4800

Rust Monster,3,aberration,underground,"This insectile monster has four legs, a strange propeller-shaped protrusion at the end of its tail, and two long, feathery antennae.","Of all the terrifying beasts an explorer might encounter underground, only the rust monster targets that which the average adventurer values most: his treasure. Typically 5 feet long and weighing almost 200 pounds, the lobster-like rust monster would be frightening enough even without the alien feeding process that gives it its name. Rust monsters consume metal objects, preferring iron and ferrous alloys like steel but devouring even mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals with equal ease. Any metal touched by the rust monster's delicate antennae or armored hide corrodes and falls to dust within seconds, making the beast a major threat to subterranean adventurers and those dwarven miners who must defend their forges and compete for ore. Though rust monsters have no innate tendency toward violence, their insatiable hunger leads them to charge anything they come across that bears even trace amounts of metal, and resistance is met with unthinking savagery. It's not unheard of for rust monsters in metalpoor areas to track escaped victims for days using their scent metal ability, provided the victims retain intact metal objects. Fortunately, it's often possible to escape a rust monster's attentions by throwing it a dense metal object like a shield and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested with rust monsters quickly learn to keep a few stone or wooden weapons close at hand.",800
Ryven,2,monstrous humanoid,temperate forests,"This humanoid resembles an anthropomorphic badger. Standing the size of man, his body is much broader and covered with grayish fur, colored with a white tribe running from his face and down his back to his bushy tail. His hands and feet end in elongated, sharpened claws","Ryven are known as badger-folk by those of other races. In appearance, they resemble man-sized, bipedal badgers. They are a battlehardened race, warring mostly with elves or centaurs, and mryvens carry the scars of such battles with pride. Ryven prefer to battle with their natural weapons, relying on their claws and fangs to down their foes. Some carry weapons, usually short swords, daggers, and light crossbows. More insidious ryven sometimes coat their weapons or crossbow bolts with death adder poison. Ryvens prefer to attack from surprise. Often, a ryven burrows underneath an unsuspecting foe and emerges from the ground in a blast of rock and dirt, catching the opponent by surprise. It then tears into its opponent with teeth and claws. Ryven have managed to gain some control over their animalistic behavior and when angered and raging, can attempt to end the rage. Ryven Society Ryven are tribal folk and build large burrows and tunnels that travel deep into the ground. Leaders are always the strongest and largest of a tribe. Tribes rarely number more than 20 creatures, so it is not uncommon to find more than one tribe sharing the same burrow. Ryvens are carnivores and actively hunt sources of meat. Favorite meals include sheep, goat, deer, and reptiles such as snakes, especially vipers. Ryvens are not adverse to eating humanoid flesh and sometimes dine on captured enemies. They consume massive quantities of meat, much more than one would normally expect a creature of their size and stature to consume, so most tribes keep a ready supply of meat handy. They are nocturnal creatures so most encounters occur at night. Raiding parties also conduct their business at night, seeking out those who would camp or sleep too close to the ryven's lair. Such unfortunates are either robbed or killed, or both. The goods and gear of slain foes are carried back to the burrow and stored. If the raiding party is also on a hunting excursion, slain foes are likewise carried back to the lair and stored until they are eaten. Entrances and exits to a ryven burrow are well camouflaged so enemies and predators cannot locate easily them. Each burrow consists of minterlocking passageways  and chambers. Such chambers function as living quarters, storage, battle grounds, or temples for the tribe. Temples are considered highly sacred places to a ryven tribe and are always well-protected and guarded. Most ryven tribes keep compwith badgers or dire badgers. Ryvens as Characters +4 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom. Strong and agile, ryven characters make excellent rogues or fighters. Each ryven tribe has at least one shaman, usually a druid. Ryven clerics worship Domga, ""the Badger God"" and can choose two of the following domains: Animal, Evil , Plant, Trickery, or Strength. Darkvision: Ryvens can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Low-Light Vision: Ryvens see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Scent: Rivens gain the scent special ability Racial Hit Dice: A ryven begins with three levels of monstrous humanoid, which provides 3d8 HD, a base attack bonus of +3, and base save bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +3. Racial Skills: A ryven's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 6 x . Its class skills are Escape Artist and Perception. Racial Feats: A ryven's monstrous humanoid class levels give it two feats. Born Tracker: +4 racial bonus to tracking by scent. Slippery: +4 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks.

Sabosan,5,monstrous humanoid,warm forests or underground,"A high-pitched sound like the opening of a rusty hinge cuts through the air as a grotesquely thin humanoid creature glides to the ground on broad, leathery wings. A bat-like head crowned in brown and black fur darts from side to side. Despite the creature's feral appearance, its eyes peer forward with keen and penetrating intelligence.","Sabosan  are an intelligent and evil race of bat-like humanoids that dwell in warm and isolated locations. A sabosan's emaciated frame belies a strength and agility not apparent from its gaunt appearance. Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Both males and females have red or dark brown fur on their heads, necks, chests, and backs. Male and female sabosan stand just under 6 feet and weigh only 150 pounds. Ecology Sabosan are vicious predators, combining human intelligence with a bat's natural adaptations for hunting. They favor warm climates, preferring to make their lairs in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such as mountainstop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean caverns near hidden hot springs, and the dense canopy of junglestrees. With wingspans almost three times their height, sabosan are agile and graceful fliers, capable of traveling miles on a single current of air in their dauntless search for prey. Although they can see as well as human in daylight, sabosan hunt at twilight or after dark when their echolocation-based blindsense ability gives them a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices offensively, funneling their screeches into blasts of highpitched sound capable of deafening other creatures. When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a sabosan employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan use their massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust and debris, rendering foes deaf and blind. Despite such effective hunting and combat techniques, all sabosan appear gaunt and emaciated, as if constantly on the brink of starvation. Cursed with a fast metabolism, they must eat approximately three times as much as a human and supplement their diet with frequent blooddrinking in order to survive. Although they can feed on almost creatures, sabosan take perverse glee in devouring other intelligent humanoids, seeing the blood of still-living humans or elves as a divine offering to their dead demon lord. Habitat & Society Sages debate the sabosan's origins. Some theorize that they are descendents of humans aff licted with vampirism whose bodies did not succumb to undeath, but still craved blood. Others contend that they were a tribe of humans who yearned for flight and were transformed in a corrupt mockery of their desire by a malevolent trickster god. Whatever their origins, the sabosan were once a great and populous race, living in the massive white-stone city of Jaytirian in the heart of the Mwangi jungles. Here, the ""dark-wings,"" as they were then called, worshiped the foul demon lord Vyriavaxus and the now forgotten sun god Easivra. When the Gorilla King and his angazhani followers marched on Jaytirian, the sabosan defended their city and drove the high girallons back, but the siege nearly destroyed them. Those that survived were forced to quit their home and spread to the far reaches of the Mwangi Expanse. In the centuries after the abandonment of Jaytirian, the other humanoid races of the Mwangi jungles came to know and fear the sabosan's shriek and thirst. Zenj tribesmen, jungleselves, and even the mysterious Umasi formed hunting parties to stalk and kill the blooddrinkers at the first sign of sabosan in their lands. Today, the sabosan live in small and isolated clans, having been hunted to the very precipice of extinction. Normally such groups consist of up to a dozen members, usually made up of some mated pairs and offspring of varied ages, invariably led by the best male hunter. Most sabosan still revere the demon lord Vyriavaxus, and thus chieftains also act as religious leaders, coordinating their tribe's attacks on other humanoids to appease the sabosan's bloodthirsty deity-usually these ""priests"" have no spellcasting ability, but a few have tapped into a source of arcane power or are granted spells by Zura, demon lord of blood and vampires. If outnumbered or overwhelmed, some clans will band together to defeat mutual enemies, but such alliances are always short-lived, as few regions are capable of supporting the dread hunger of more than one sabosan clan. Females usually have one breeding season per year, and after an 8-month gestation produce a single, flightless pup. Sabosan young achieve full use of their wings relatively quickly but spend the first months of their life clinging to the chest of either parent, where they can experience flight and taste the fresh blood of their parents' victims. Children achieve reproductive maturity in just under 10 years, at which time females and males alike take an unrelated clan member as a mate if the clan's territory can support them. Otherwise, the new adults leave the roost and search for smaller clans or-in the case of some males-for territories that can support the creation of a new clan. Upon reaching maturity, some brave-or foolish-sabosan challenge their clan's chieftain for leadership. If the challenge is accepted, the two sabosan engage in a bloody melee, eschewing all weapons to fight with their claws and savage fangs. The Bout of Challenge, as it is known, lasts until death or surrender. Most sabosan choose death above surrender, as losing the Bout of Challenge is to lose Vyriavaxus' favor and to no longer be considered a sabosan-and therefore not subject to the taboo against cannibalism. Vampire Sabosan A small number of sabosan leaders have the vampire spawn template, and are easily recognized by their graying hair and red eyes. These undead still thirst for blood like their living kin, but do not need to eat solid food, and thus the rest of a spawn's clan have a slightly better chance at survival. Because of their powers, these spawn usually lead their clans. Due to a quirk of how the vampire corruption interacts with sabosan bodies, most sabosan cannot be made into full vampires, and attempt just results in a vampire spawn sabosan. Among the sabosan spawn, there is a legend of the ""Night King,"" a true vampire of their kind who is destined to bring together the clans and break the back of the Gorilla King, seizing his lands for the sabosan and using his minions as food and slaves.",1600
Sabrewing,6,outsider,outer planes,"A 6-foot tall muscular humanoid with black, rubbery flesh stretches two large, leathery wings in place of its arms. Rigid plates of razor-sharp bone jut from the wing's outer edge. It perches on long, muscular legs that end in three-toed clawed feet. Peers menacingly through golden pupil slits, its wide, snarling grimace exposes rows of sharp teeth.","Sabrewings are winged humanoids from an unknown outer plane believed to be formed of rock and lined with razor-sharp blades of all shapes and sizes. These creatures delight in killing those weaker than themselves and often travel the outer planes preying on such creatures when they encounter them. Evil spellcasters and powerful outsiders  sometimes employ these creatures as assassins because of the sabrewing's skill at killing and the creature's desire to do nothing else. They are not averse to venturing to the Material Plane to answer an evil summons, and often do so, usually with the intent of fulfilling the bargain and then killing the summoner . If called by a powerful outsider, a sabrewing will not attempt to kill its summoner, as it's smart enough to know when it's outmatched. In such cases, they simply do their job and then return to their native plane. Little is known of their native plane, but one adventurer that has supposedly seen this place speaks of huge citadels and fortresses constructed of iron and earth surrounded by ""forests of steel blades."" This information has never been substantiated and plane jumpers have been unable to locate such a plane.  Sabrewings prefer to attack from the air, using speed to their advantage while also staying out of the reach of their opponents. Before combat, sabrewings usually cast magic weapon or greater magic weapon on their wings before engaging in combat so they can use their wings to the utmost advantage Multiple sabrewings work in concert with one another to bring down foes; one draws an opponent's attention while another swoops in from behind and slashes with its deadly wings.

Sagari,0.5,aberration,forests,"This unsettling creature has the head of a fanged, green-eyed horse and a body that is little more than a writhing tentacle.","Sagaris haunt forests trails, hanging upside-down from tree branches by the grotesque tentacles that make up their necks.

Their piercing whinny causes sickness within those who hear it, the sound waves reverberating within the victims' chests and causing them to feel unwell. Groups of sagaris are particularly dangerous, filling the air with their terrifying neighs and diving upon utterly helpless, nauseated victims in a rush. The tentacle of a sagari is not strong enough to grab or strangle enemies, but serves the creature well as an additional attack to augment its bite. Sagaris are strictly carnivorous, and while they resort to feeding on carrion if necessary, they greatly prefer fresh meat. When a sagari makes its way into a settlement either to wreak havoc or by accident, it can be found hanging from the rafters of a barn or some other structure with a tall ceiling. Stabled livestock are ideal prey for sagaris, who can swiftly kill and devour the flesh of a trapped animal in minutes. A sagari will not attack a creature that it suspects is much stronger, though it will sometimes assault groups of creatures, hoping to sicken enough of its foes to distract them while it attacks the weakest individual. Sagaris are thought to have originally come from the vast caverns beneath the world's surface. While sagaris can speak, they rarely do so with those they deem prey, seeing little point in communicating with food. Despite their relative intelligence, sagaris rarely form societies of nature, at most traveling in roving packs in search of larger prey to take down as a group. A sagari is 3 feet long from mouth to tentacle and weighs 30 pounds.",200
Sahuagin,2,monstrous humanoid,temperate or warm oceans,"This scaly humanoid has a long, fish-like tail. Its arms and legs end in webbed claws, and its piscine head features a toothy maw.","Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceansic races. Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep oceans trenches, and mare the near-coastlines fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other waters races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds. Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society's nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms . Rumors speak of the rare malenti-sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but waters elves, yet who share their kin's bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of allmalenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.",600
Sailors,0.5,humanoid,oceans or coastlines,"This rugged character is clad in colorful, mismatched clothing, his hair tied back in a bandana.","The average pirate is a free-spirited renegade who would have great difficulty surviving in the cultured depths of polite, civilized society. Rogues and fighters typically make up the majority of a pirate ship's crew of sailors, as they possess both the skill and brawn necessary for day-to-day raids and heists. These colorful, adventurous characters chafe at society's laws and restrictions, and the exciting life of the buccaneer is well suited to pirates' ferocious independence.",200
Salamander,6,outsider,any,"This snake-bodied humanoid hisses with anger. Spines of crackling flame dance along the creature's blackened, fiery-red scales.","Salamanders are native to the Plane of Fire, where their legions of fierce warriors are much feared by the other inhabitants of the plane. Because some of the stronger elemental fire races enslave salamanders for their metalworking skill and fighting prowess, the salamanders hate the efreet and other inhabitants with a passion. Though their lairs typically hover in temperatures of 500 degrees F or more, salamanders can tolerate lower temperatures. They generally do so only when forced, and are even surlier and more short-tempered than normal in such environments. Although they hail from the Plane of Fire, the salamander race identifies more with the Abyss, and they hold demons  in great esteem. It's not unusual to encounter large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result. Salamanders are often conjured to the Material Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, to craft weapons, armor, and other metalwork, for their skill in these areas is legendary. Salamanders also infest areas of the Material Plane where the boundaries between this world and the Plane of Fire have worn thin, such as in and near volcanoes. Because their habitat is so extreme, salamanders only save treasure that can withstand high temperatures, such as swords, armor, jewels, rods, and other items made from high-melting-point metals. Salamander society is a cruel one based on power and the ability to subjugate those beneath oneself. Beings beneath a salamander that cause it discomfort are dealt a slow and painful death.",2400
Salikotal,7,outsider,any,"On lean limbs the color of spilt blood creeps a being of sinister grace. Eyes like embers and a sneer full of needle-thin teeth gleam from an unmistakably fiendish visage. A pair of crimson wings sprout from the back of the hairless humanoid form, fluttering silently like an assassin's cloak, while in one hand it clutches the twisted, dagger-like horn of some infernal terror.","Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life. Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile appendages. Ecology Salikotals rise from the tenebrous reaches of Erebus's vaulted heights. Unblinking and endlessly patient, salikotals haunt the claustrophobic upper realms of the lightless labyrinth, stealthy and watchful but caring little for the doings of intruders or their lesser kin. Only the summons of conjurers or the diabolical elite rouse them from their eerie aerial stalkings, drawing them forth from the shadows for a chance to hone their death-dealing expertise in the name of Hell. Naturally silent, salikotals never vocalize even the slightest sound, relying on their innate telepathic abilities for communication. Even when using such mental interaction, though, the devils prove terse and resistant to conversation. For most summoners, a salikotal's only communication is a slow nod acknowledging its orders, and a nod in answer to the question of its murderous success. Habitat & Society Salikotals have little to do with others of their kind, be they other salikotals or other lesser devils in general. Emotionless and rigid even beyond the typical disciplines of Hell, these assassins realize they exist for but a single reason: to sow death. Their cold precision only wavers when they discuss payment for their most notorious murderous methods, wherein they demand specific types of gemstones in compensation for their grisly work. Few non-devils dare to suppose why salikotals request such precise payments, refusing to work for other recompense, but among the damned spread rumors of vast vaults filled with glistening jewels, each a fabulous treasure and a representation of a life cut short by the blades of Hell. Summoning Salikotals As in all things, salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned, though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other than assassination takes a -2 penalty. Once a salikotal has agreed to perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's victim for an associated price. The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit Die its target possesses , to be paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions with it in the future take a -2 penalty.",3200
Salt Drake,8,dragon,temperate or warm plains,This powerful creature resembles a blue dragon with mottled black wings and crimson eyes. Its ears are frilled and swept back against its head.,"Salt drakes are found in warm, arid climates such as deserts or salt flats. Salt drakes are omnivorous creatures and very territorial, even fighting among themselves to protect their domains. Most encounters are with a solitary drake. Only in the midsummer months is it common to find a mated pair or family. A salt drake's scales range from dull blue to midnight blue, and it is often mistaken for a young blue dragon. Salt drakes range from 8 feet to 30 feet long. Though difficult to train, salt drakes are favored as mounts by goblins, gnolls, and hobgoblins. A salt drake's primary diet consists of large quantities of salt. This diet enables the drake to spew salt at its opponents. A salt drake opens combat from the air using its salt spray breath weapon. If unable to utilize its breath weapon, it relies on its claws and bite to finish off remaining opponents. Training a Salt Drake A salt drake requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a salt drake must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer . Training a friendly salt drake requires ten weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal check. Riding a salt drake requires an exotic saddle. A salt drake can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Salt drake eggs are worth 6,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 12,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 2,000 gp to rear or train a dragonnel. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a salt drake is up to 516 pounds; a medium load, 517-1,038 pounds, and a heavy load, 1,039-1,560 pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800

Sand Giant,14,humanoid,warm deserts,"This giant looks like a savage humanoid with dark tan skin, dark hair, and green eyes.","Sand giants are brutal, somewhat barbaric giants that prey on those weaker than themselves. They have dark tan skin, brown hair, and dark brown or dark green eyes. An adult male stands approximately 20 feet tall. Males tend to wear their hair and beards braided. Sand giants wear light clothes and light armor . In times of battle or war, males may don chainmail. A typical sand giant's bag contains food, 3d4 mundane items, and a modest amount of cash . Sand giants can live to be 500 years old. Sand giants make their homes in warm deserts lands away from civilization. They live in organized tribes consisting of 8-9 families of 2-4 members each. On occasion, a tribe forms a raiding party that sets off to the nearest civilized place, returning at a later time with food, coins, and captives. For each adult in a sand giant's lair, there is a 40% chance that the lair has 1d3 captives of humanoid race. Sand giants favor their greatswords in combat. They usually begin combat by shaping a fist from the surrounding terrain and attacking with their greatswords in concert with the earthen fist. Sand giant do not throw rocks like mother giants do, but they can catch rocks or similar projectiles as other giants. Sand Giant Characters Sand giants are combative, and most are fighters.

Sand Kraken,8,magical beast,warm deserts,"A huge, bloated, eyeless, formless octopus rises from the sand. From its pale, yellow shapeless body sprouts ten long tentacles tipped with cruel barbed pads.","The sand krakens are dangerous creatures encountered only in remote wastelands. A sand kraken keeps its body well concealed, buried deep in sand or loose rock, and inaccessible to most attacks. The creature never moves from the place where it digs its first burrow and once it settles in, will never again see the light of day. The only parts of a sand kraken that are usually seen are its tentacles, and by then it is often too late. Sand krakens are omnivores, but prefer meat to other food. Once it captures and kills its prey, it pulls the carcass down into its sandy lair, and devours it with its great central maw. For this reason, a number of scholars speculate a biological relationship between sand krakens and dustdiggers. For most of its life, a sand kraken remains dormant and silent, buried several feet below the surface of the ground. When it senses prey its tentacles swiftly rise to the surface. A sand kraken uses its initial attacks to immobilize its prey by constriction. Each tentacle has its own secondary brain, and can attack independently. While tentacles can be harmed and severed, the only true way to kill a sand kraken is to dig it up and destroy its body. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.",4800
Sand Stalker,4,magical beast,warm deserts,"Scurrying from the sands rises a monstrously-sized spider. Standing taller than a horse, its lean frame rocks gently and its pale hair bristles in agitation.","Sand stalkers are agile, 12-foot-long, aggressive, hunting spiders with voracious appetites. Thankfully they are found only in deserts and usually away from civilized areas. The sand stalker is a wanderer; though some do occasionally build lairs. These consist of an open hole constructed in areas where the ground is hard enough to prevent a flood of sand and debris from filling the lair. Some sand stalkers cover their burrows with a ""trapdoor"" . If the ground is unsuitable for burrowing, the stalker takes up residence in whatever shelter is available, such as an abandoned temple or beneath a rocky outcropping. Sand stalkers are typically solitary creatures though on some occasions a few of the creatures nest together. A typical nest consists of 1d4+1 sand stalkers, usually two males, and two females with the female sand stalkers being the dominate forces in the nest. Sand stalkers are carnivores and hunt all manner of deserts-dwelling or deserts-traveling creatures. Aggressive predators, they prefer to use stealth to attack by surprise. They burrow just beneath the surface of the sand, leaving their front forelegs exposed where the wind catches them and plays an eerie flute-like sound. They use this deception to attract prey. Creatures that are affected by the hypnotic sound are attacked as soon as they come close. If hungry or threatened, a sand stalker uses its superior speed to run down its prey.

Sandling,2,outsider,Elemental Plane of Earth,This creature appears to be a large snake formed of earth and sand. A slit seems to function as the creature's mouth.,"Sandlings are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. A sandling in its natural form resembles a mound of sand that covers a 10-foot area. They are most often summoned to the Material Plane by clerics and wizards, though on occasion a sandling slips through a vortex connecting the Elemental Plane of Earth to the Material Plane. Sandlings live on a diet of minerals only and cannot digest plants, herbs, meat, or other substances. Opponents killed by a sandling are left for scavengers. Sandlings have no real society and are highly solitary in nature. Though they harbor no ill-will towards others of their kind, it is very rare to find more than one sandling operating near another. Reproduction methods among sandlings is unknown to sages but it is believed they create others of their kind by division . A sandling lies in wait in its natural form until it detects an interloper in its territory. It then assumes its serpentine form and attacks with an abrasive bite. A typical sandling is 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20 to 25 feet.

Sandpoint Devil,8,outsider,any,"This mangy horselike beast walks perversely upright. Wings, a dragon's tail, and a fanged mouth complete its vile appearance.","The legendary Sandpoint Devil has haunted the lands around its namesake town on the western Varisian coast for well over a decade. It most commonly appears on misty, moonless nights, sometimes leaving behind strange clues to its passing, such as brimstone-smelling hoofprints in odd places . A thief of livestock, kidnapper of children, and bringer of woes-countless tales surround the beast. Some explain away the creature as an ancient, wizard-warped beast from a forgotten age.

Sangudaemon,9,outsider,any,"This vaguely arachnid creature is the size of a human and is composed entirely of blood, globs of the viscous stuff dripping down its spindly legs and from its serpentine maw. A jagged set of obsidian fangs protrudes from its drooling mouth, and huge dragonf ly wings of crimson blood splay from the thing's back producing a terrifying buzz.","A horrid combination of mosquito, spider, and vampire, sangudaemons personify death by blood loss. These horrors of Abaddon takes great pleasure in the act of draining their victims of blood, considering the fluid to be the essence of all mortality and the fundamental residence of the soul while within a mortal body. A sangudaemon bathes in the ruby humor, the fiend's own body resembling a brutal and gory massacre in full swing, with blood constantly coating and glistening its armored, chitinous carapace. Once the last vital drop has left a victim's body- thus depriving the soul of its last defenses, according to the mythology of the sangudaemons-the voracious insectile horror begins to devour its victim's spirit in earnest. An individual sangudaemon stands about 5 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and has a wingspan of 6 feet. Ecology A sangudaemon typically spawns from the soul of an evil mortal who died due to blood loss, such as a casualty of giant leeches or mosquitoes, or possibly the drained victim of a ravenous vampire. Whatever the cause, a sangudaemon seeks to inf lict its cruel fate upon others, traversing the planes in search of mortal victims to bleed and consume. Wherever a sangudaemon goes, blood follows, as its mere presence seems to indicate a thinning of bodily fluids and the ensuing chaos of merciless and nondiscriminatory bloodletting. Perhaps more so than other caste of daemon, sangudaemons ""hunt"" for souls in the most traditional sense of the word. Lurking primarily at night while on the Material Plane, a sangudaemon prowls the darkest corners of urban areas and sparsely populated lands alike, preying on unwary victims and dragging them back to its secluded den. Such lairs are gory, dark places, the walls entirely awash in blood. From the ceiling of a sangudaemon's lair, the fiend hangs the cocooned bodies of countless victims, some still barely conscious beneath their grotesque wrappings-bindings made of hardened blood and the eff luvium of devoured and regurgitated souls. A sangudaemon entombs its victims in these fibrous casings like a giant spider does its prey, slowly sucking the bodies dry of both blood and spirit. Sangudaemons keep their lairs underground or at high elevations in order to best preserve the bodies within, though when the cocoons have been completely leeched, the remnants begin to crumble into dust, and such charnel houses eventually fill with the dry, brittle ashes of victims. Habitat & Society While out hunting in either the wastes of Abaddon or throughout other planes, sangudaemons often work in packs of up to 10 individuals, and though they hunt together, they much prefer to keep their own independent lairs to drag victims back to for slower feedings. Other daemons find sangudaemons' potent abilities useful, especially on battlefields where blood is spilt. Piscodaemons and purrodaemons in particular find use for their services, shedding much blood in their destructive rampages and benefiting from sangudaemons' unique and devastating control over spilt blood. While sangudaemons sometimes spawn from the souls of blood-drained victims of vampires, the daemons and the undead share no love for one another, and msangudaemons openly despise vampires. Some speculate that sangudaemons that hate vampires do so because they themselves were victims to the undead as mortals, and a faint and bitter impression permeates their otherwise vacuous recollection. The contempt some sangudaemons have for vampires often runs so deep that the daemons seek out these undead souls in particular, hoping to utterly consume them, as sangudaemons often find vampires' tainted blood even more delicious than other creature's. A sangudaemon will at times trade numerous souls and soul gems via Abaddon's markets for just a single vampire's soul, so much do they delight in the obliteration and consumption of the thing. As such outspoken hunters of vampires, sangudaemons often find themselves at odds with the goals of Urgathoa, Abaddon's resident goddess of undeath. Though most daemons would never dream of siphoning some of her destined souls to sate their own hungers, the mere existence of the two polar forces within the blasted lands nevertheless creates an uncomfortable tension between the fiends and the goddess. What the two sides agree on is excessive gluttony, though Urgathoa's followers often partake merely of food, whereas sangudaemons indulge themselves purely on blood. As a caste, sangudaemons have a distinct preference for service to both Apollyon and Szuriel. Those in service to the Horseman of Pestilence live in his festering swamps and frequently incubate various hemorrhagic fevers and blood-thinning diseases within their various pockets of consumed mortal blood, keeping the diseases alive and active until they can be dispersed through new populations for maximum carnage. Szuriel, meanwhile, spreads the plague of war wherever she passes, and thus bloodshed is an inevitability; whether this large-scale bloodletting is brought on by the tip of a sword or the hungering jaws of a sangudaemon matters not to the Horseman of War, and she gladly accepts the services of the eager and hungry sangudaemons, who are driven to ecstatic revels by battlef ield gore.",6400
Sanguine Ooze Swarm,0.33,ooze,underground,"Dozens of tiny globs of slime move on their own, acting as one being, alternately clinging to each other and separating in a riot of oozing momentum.","Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures mtimes their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent.

One of the legendary beasts known as the Tane, a sard has ""sap"" that consists of red lightning-all of the sard's electrical attacks manifest with this same eerie-colored energy. A sard can pass for an old dead tree- especially when the creature uses its tree shape spell-like ability. Yet despite its enormous size and ungainly shape, the sard is in fact a swift and agile monster. It can move with unsettling grace and speed, crawling across the ground on long spidery roots like an immense insect. It attacks either with a single slam of its immense trunk or by launching volleys of foot-long thorns that inject the creature's poisonous, electrified sap. Sards are nearly as intelligent as most humans, but few actually use this intelligence for productive purposes-the first sards were created as a form of living siege engine, and they quite enjoy this destructive role, often seeking out fortresses or even towns to systematically destroy.",204800
Sargassum Fiend,9,plant,oceans,"This shifting mass of green seaweed transforms from the shape of a humanoid back to a patch of algae, continually changing.","A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants. The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk. Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step.",6400
Sasquatch,2,humanoid,temperate or cold forests,"Tall, burly, and hairy, this humanoid creature wields a large tree branch for a club and has a swinging, apelike gait.","The elusive sasquatches earn their mysterious reputation rightly; they live in unpopulated forests and avoid confrontations with humanoids, only becoming violent when they feel threatened, when their territory is encroached upon, or when they feel they must protect their young. Left to their own devices, sasquatch families are perfectly content to live their lives in the deep woods, leaving behind little to no trace of their passing save for the periodic big footprint in the ground. Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are incredibly stealthy creatures, capable of moving through forests in particular with astonishing grace and efficiency. The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches' stealth is their distinctive odor-a pungent, muskies scent that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches themselves are not apparent. The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a world where dragons and sea monsters are real, murban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall in a forests makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and ""knocking""-the act of striking a solid surface  with a club or stone-and thus tends to blend in with the ambient sounds of a forests. A sasquatch is 8 feet tall and weighs 570 pounds. Rural populaces often have fond nicknames for these creatures, such as wild men, skunk apes, and perhaps most popularly, simply bigfoot.",600
Satyr,4,fey,temperate forests,"This handsome, grinning man has the furry legs of a goat and a set of curling ram horns extending from his temples.","Satyrs, known in some regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic creatures of the deepest, most primeval parts of the woods. They adore wine, music, and carnal delights, and are renowned as rakes and smooth-talkers, wooing unwary maidens and shepherd boys and leaving a trail of awkward explanations and unplanned pregnancies in their wakes. Though their bodies are almost always those of attractive and well-built men, much of the satyrs' talent for seduction lies in their talent for music. With the aid of his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide variety of melodic spells designed to enchant others and bring them in line with his capricious desires. In addition to their constant frolicking, satyrs often act as guardians of the creatures in their forests homes, and who manage to turn the satyr's lust to wrath are likely to find themselves facing down dangerous animals surrounding the faun. Still, while satyrs tend to value their own amusement well above the rights of others, they bear no ill will toward those they seduce. Children born from such encounters are always full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin soon after birth.",1200
Saumen Kar,10,monstrous humanoid,"cold plains, hills, or deserts",This hulking humanoid's dense fur is scored with rune-shaped brands. Skin cracked and blackened by frostbite stretches taught over a misshapen skull crowned with a pair of ivory horns.,"This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading marctic races to refer to them as ""men of snow."" A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands-though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk. Ecology These solitary creatures eke out a bitter existence across the equally bitter landscape of the Crown of the World, their origins a mystery even to themselves. They are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion's share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of creature but their own kind. Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar's lair contains crude ice replicas of common Erutaki implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments. The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar's flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some Erutaki elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: ""favored."" The runes' powers lead mto believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the North, such as Hshrha, the Duchess of All Winds; the Empyreal Lord Tolc; or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands' protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world's summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur. Habitat & Society The Crown of the World is an unforgiving place, and the saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires. Saumen kars' antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male's and favorably disposed female's paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life. Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the North rather than specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of mgenerations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance. Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant inf luenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of the Erutaki languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings. Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet.",9600

Its head appears to be a straw-stuffed bag with holes cut in it to serve as eyes.,"The animated scarecrow is nearly indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow. Close examination, however, reveals a tiny spark of red light in its eyes . Each scarecrow is unique in construction and design, but most are about 6 feet tall, constructed of wood and ropes, and stuffed with straw or grass. Scarecrows are most often used as guardians to keep out would-be treasure hunters or trespassers. A scarecrow attempts to fascinate the most powerful opponent it faces using its gaze attack. If it succeeds, it pummels that foe with its fists until the opponent is dead. It does not completely ignore other combatants as it uses its gaze attack to charm them so it can deal with them once its primary foe is dead. Construction Each scarecrow varies in appearance: one may have a stuffed straw head, for example, while another may have a pumpkin for its head. Whatever the differences, scarecrows do have some elements in common: their bodies and all limbs are constructed of wood and bound by ropes; their clothes are almost always dirty and ragged; and most scarecrows are stuffed with straw or grass.

Scarlet Walker,12,outsider,any,"This crimson horror walks upon six long, thin legs. Its face is neither that of a skull nor spider, but some horrid mix of the two.","The scarlet walker is an alien entity from some other dimension, often conjured by the wizards of Thassilon to serve as a minion. Scarlet walkers were particularly favored for their adeptness at interrogating prisoners, either via torture, or via the creatures' uncanny ability to mentally compel both actions and compliance. Once an interrogation was over, the scarlet walker's master typically commanded the monster to render the victim insane or feebleminded if mere death wasn't appropriate. Scarlet walkers themselves hail from the nightmare realm of Leng, where they walk amid strange, stony deserts and stride through the skies above. No mere predators, scarlet walkers build immense hives of coagulated blood and tissue in nameless mountains valleys, and the flavors of various creatures' blood is an inexhaustible topic of discussion among their kind.",19200
Sceaduinar,7,outsider,any,"This gargoyle-like creature has long spiky legs and a bat-like head-its body seems to be made of living, dark purple crystal.","Sceaduinars are strange creatures born of pure entropy, the antithesis of creation and life. In the cold heart of the Negative Energy Plane, the un-substance of that realm coalesces into snowf lakes-like crystals, and it is from these strange formations that sceaduinars arise, breaking free from their jagged ""eggs"" fully grown. They hate the living and the undead with equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life , though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction. In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of destruction- even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a particularly dangerous foe.",3200
Schir,4,outsider,any,This goat-headed humanoid is covered in a mangy gray hide that only partly covers its gaunt but muscled frame.,"A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds. Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders. Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times. A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army- often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.",1200

Screaming devilkins are smallish beasts, humanoid in appearance but with frail and spindly arms and legs. These weak limbs are nearly useless for combat and locomotion, but the screaming devilkin makes up for this disability with its bat-like wings. Although screaming devilkins are fast fliers, they are not particularly agile on the wing. Screaming devilkins also have a long, muscular, barbed tail that is their primary means of physical attack. It should be noted that despite its appearance and name, the screaming devilkin has no connection with outsiders of type. A screaming devilkin is a tireless combatant, refusing to back down regardless of how the combat is progressing; it always attacks on sight. It attacks in melee by stabbing with its barbed tail  and screams continuously until it or its opponent is dead. A typical screaming devilkin is 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of about 5 feet.

Screaming Skull,4,construct,any,A bleached humanoid skull with glittering rubies embedded into its eye sockets rests silently.,"Screaming skulls are immobile guardians created with the purpose of guarding or protecting a specific object or area. They are often used in concert with other monsters as their screaming alerts other creatures to the presence of intruders. A screaming skull obeys its commands to the letter. Should its creator die or should the screaming skull be unable to carry out its commands, its magical nature ceases to function and it becomes nothing more than a normal skull. Its gemstone eyes dull to a lackluster gray, effectively becoming worthless stones. A screaming skull sits undisturbed until a creature moves within 30 feet of it when it unleashes its hellish scream. Other creatures are subjected to its magic missile attack.

Scylla,16,aberration,waters,"This horrifying creature has the upper body of a beautiful woman, but a lower body of snapping wolf heads and writhing tentacles.","The scylla is one of the more nightmarish aberrations to blight the mortal world. Conf licting tales of her origins abound, from demonic flesh-crafting and arcane experiments to a divine curse handed down by a vengeful deity. The most popular stories cast the first scylla as the monstrous spawn of a union between a mortal and a god. Whatever the case, scyllas are fortunately quite rare, enough so that mconsider them nothing more than tall tales told by sailors deep in their cups. Scyllas dwell along major shipping lanes, often near coastlines, where they use their spell-like abilities to lure entire ships to their doom. The hideous monsters are intelligent creatures, though half-mad with hunger and self-loathing.

Scythe Horn,4,animal,temperate hills or plains,This large stag-like creature stands the size of a large warhorse. A pair of jagged and terrible-looking antlers crown its brow. They look like they could slice a man in half.,"Year-round grazers, scythe horns live in moderate to cold climates existing primarily on a diet of grasses, roots, and similar vegetation. Scythe horns are herd animals and most often encountered within a herd. When traveling, scythe horns form a straight line, with the strongest male  at the front of the herd. Similarly, the next strongest bull takes its spot at the rear of the herd. Young are always kept in the middle with the females in front of and behind the calves. If the herd is attacked, the female scythe horns  move to encircle the young, while the bulls move to confront the threat. During winter months when ice and snow cover the ground, scythe horns generally congregate near waters sources such as lakes or streams, where the ground may give easier access to the vegetation they need to survive. Also, during the winter months, scythe horns either obtain waters from such streams or crush snow and ice between their flattened teeth. The average scythe horn is 10 to 13 feet long, standing 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulders, and weighs 2,000 to 2,500 pounds. Its body is covered in a thick brownish-black or brownish-gray fur, longer in the front around the neck than in the rear of the animal. Its legs are short and thick and its black hooves are circular in shape. Its most identifying features are its magnificent ebony colored horns which curve upward and inward in a scythe-like shape. Scythe horns are often hunted by humanoids for their fur, hide , and meat. Scythe horns are highly territorial and move to engage creature that comes within their area. They are generally passive creatures but become highly aggressive if their young or the herd is threatened. An enraged scythe horn butts or slashes with its scythe-like horns. If startled, a herd generally flees, starting a stampede in the process. Scimitar Horn A relative of the scythe horn, the scimitar horn is found only in cold plains and hills. They use the same statistics for the scythe horn, but have no butt attack, and attack by slashing with their scimitar-like horns. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Scythe Tree,6,plant,temperate forests,"This many-branched and twisted tree has few leaves on it. In the center of its trunk is a long, deep scar.

Sczarni Thugs,1,humanoid,any,This thuggish Varisian wears black garb and tattered rags that conceal his myriad small blades and reveal runic tattoos.,"The notorious ruffians known as the Sczarni constantly prowl the civilized areas of Varisia in search of easily bamboozled merchants, travelers, and aristocrats to prey upon. Countless Sczarni thugs operate throughout Magnimar, their sheer quantity spawning numerous gangs that each possesses its own illicit specialty as well as a clearly defined turf. Indisputably, the most powerful Sczarni gang in the city is the Gallowed, who operate from a caravan of wagons perched directly below Lord-Mayor Grobaras's home, Defiant's Garden. The Gallowed sports a large number of thugs and leg-breakers, as well as its infamous Fish Tank, a 4-foot-tall glass aquarium hidden in one of the caravan's wagons and filled with swamps barracuda used to coax information out of unwilling victims. As a rule, Sczarni thugs are not needlessly violent, and prefer to concentrate their efforts on crimes that will make them the most money rather than spill the most blood. Sczarni tend toward swindles and illicit trade instead of rape or murder, leaving such brutal acts of violence to sociopaths and unscrupulous thieves' guilds. Though the Gallowed make up the most powerful Sczarni gang in Magnimar, they are far from alone, and numerous other small families constantly vie for turf and wealth throughout the City of Monuments. The Tower Girls specialize in robbery as well as extortion, and are often hired by quarreling nobles to help shame or blackmail rivals with evidence of infidelity, bastard children, or other secret failures. When not ruining lives, the Tower Girls display their impressive acrobatics onstage in the various playhouses and nightclubs of Lowcleft. Shunned even by other Sczarni gangs, the Creepers seed the streets with drugs and other illicit substances. They concoct mof the drugs in their base near Underbridge, using their runners to keep the whole city stocked with a handful of vices at time.",400
Sea Bonze,15,undead,oceans,"Massive and blacker than the darkest depths of the sea, this colossal watersy form glares with two immense, hate-filled eyes.","The oceans knows few terrors as unnatural and horrific as the sea bonze. This undead goliath dwells near established shipping lanes or offshore from coastlines settlements, where it lurks just beneath the surface of the waters until it can strike unsuspecting boats in the dead of night. Sailors often advise launching oceans voyages only during the day on the assumption that doing so might protect them from the sea bonze's attention, but such tactics make little difference to the creature itself, which will trail a particular ship until after dusk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, only to lurch out of the waters and lay waste to an entire ship. Sea bonzes are formed from the combined despair and horror of death at sea, such as when a ship sinks and its entire crew drowns. No single restless soul empowers a sea bonze-it combines the anger and doom of all who die in such close proximity. Reawakened as mammoth ship-wreckers, these angry spirits have no memory of their past lives, and seek to inf lict the doom they suffered on others who ply the seas. Their hatred does not make them mindless, however, and more than one lucky crew member has talked her entire ship's way out of total annihilation. Sea bonzes have an unusual respect for those with wit and guile, and will sometimes consider sparing those they deem worthy of their esteem. Those who try to defend themselves with brawn and weapons, however, receive no mercy from the enormous monsters. A sea bonze's flesh is black and leathery like that of a squid, and appears at first glance to be made out of the black waters of the oceans itself. The entire creature is featureless and smooth, making its empty visage all the more horrifying.",51200
Sea Cat,4,magical beast,waters,"This fierce creature has the forebody of a great cat, with two powerful, clawed legs under a threatening mouth of sharp claws. Colorful fins cover its back and torso, leading to a sleek tail, like that of a great fish.","The feral sea cat  is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastlines predators in the world's tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical large cat-be it a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah- complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the waters. While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins, making it a formidable swimmer. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often inf luenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; most sea cats, however, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. The typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds. Ecology Unlike mwaters animals, sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt waters and in subarctic climate, though they prefer warm seas to temperate lakes or rivers. Sea cats rely on speed and ferocity in the hunt, and are thus not built to withstand extreme cold, as they lacks fur or fat to insulate them in frigid waters. Most sea cats live in the oceans, where the diversity of life allows for a varied and consistent supply of food, though prides of sea cats and particularly adventurous individuals of the species have been known to follow prey into rivers deltas and beyond to inland lakes if pickings become slim in the sea. A sea cat's diet consists of small fish, crustaceans, and waters mammals such as seals and otters, but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack oceans birds, humanoids, and even other waters predators such as sharks and crocodiles. coastlines fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell vigilantly look out for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line, using less energy. As if the theft of a hard-earned catch weren't enough to keep anglers on guard, a sea cat that finds itself unsated by a net of fish or a trapped crab will often turn its sights on the other end of the fishing line and attack the very fisherman who helped it gain its meal. When not hunting, sea cats can be found on coastlines rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. When in a state of rest, sea cats are typically less alert and more vulnerable, and thus often lounge in pairs or larger groups so that one can act as lookout. This is especially true of mothers rearing cubs, which have been known to stay awake for as long as a week straight to allow their young rest in their most vulnerable time of life. Sea cats are ferocious hunters and when taken by the primal urge to fight, do so to the death, with little regard for anything but their prey. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe. A sea cat uses its claws and bite frantically, only ceasing its assault when the target is dead. If faced with multiple opponents, a sea cat attacks the nearest target and single-mindedly fights until that creature is dead. Pairs or prides of sea cats use pack tactics when hunting or defending their territories, wearing opponents down until a single beast can dispatch it, often allowing those of the larger group to escape while the entire pack focuses on a single target. A sea cat's physical characteristics are as much a product of the animal's environment as they are a result of genetics, and a sea cat's coloration often directly mimics its habitat. Sea cats living among colorful coral or particularly vibrant vegetation are often marked with spots and stripes of vivid red, orange, violet, and yellow, while those specimens on rocky or sandy beaches take on more earthy tones and mottled patterns. Habitat & Society Sea cats are born in litters of between one and six cubs, and mothers raise their young in isolation from the rest of a pride until the young are between 6 and 9 months in age. During this time, the mother teaches the young to hunt, mark their territory, and defend themselves against intruders. When a litter of sea cats reaches maturity, their sea cat mother simply abandons them and returns to her pride, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Some young find their way back to the pride and are quickly assimilated into the group, while others form new prides centered around the location where their mothers abandoned them. A pride typically consists of a single male  and as mas a dozen mature females who do a majority of the hunting and defending of the territory. Males without a pride of their own remain solitary hunters and are called stags. Each year, at mating season, stags approach a pride's territory and attempt to lure females away from the rest of the group as the females keep vigil over the pride's territory. When a male has a single female isolated, the two battle with all the ferocity of their species. Whichever sea cat has the upper hand relents in the last moment before killing its foe as a sign of acceptance of the mating offer, and if the other sea cat remains peaceful and does not use the moment of hesitation as an opportunity for counterstrike, the courtship dance is considered a success. Occasionally, a particularly willful stag encroaches on a bull's territory in an attempt to wrest his pride from him. In these cases, all females abandon the males to their duel, returning the following day and taking up loyalty to whichever male remains alive. The typical pride changes leaders once or twice a year, while more volatile prides see a change in leadership as often as five or six times annually. A sea cat's territory generally extends between 2 and 5 miles from its den, though most sea cats patrol only as far as a mile or two from the shore. Since a sea cat can't breathe waters and must come up for air, only the bravest or most foolhardy sea cats venture farther than 2 miles from land, meaning a creature wishing to bypass a sea cat's territory can often go around it by traveling farther out to sea than the cat itself is willing to swim to protect its realm. A sea cat releases a powerful pheromone into the waters to mark the boundaries of its territory, and thus must trace the borders every day or two in order to maintain them, as the constant flow of waters dilutes the scent to the point of ineffectuality within 4 days depending on the strength of currents and tidal and weather conditions. The sea cat's generally low intelligence and high level of ferocity makes it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, but merfolk, waters elves, locathahs, and even surface-dwelling pirates and sailors have occasionally been known to take a cub and raise it as a pet. Whether these are simply legends meant to frighten away potential enemies or true accounts of taming a sea cat are not widely known, but the sea cat's natural territorial instincts make it a formidable guardian if properly trained. Additionally, some pirate ports are known for capturing sea cats and pitting them against one another for sport.",1200
Sea Drake,6,dragon,coastlines,"Not quite sea serpent or dragon, this vicious beast is covered with shiny blue-green scales. Its arms serve as both wings and flippers.","While obviously the product of draconic inbreeding, the heritage of sea drakes is less clear than that of other drakes. Among the strongest of the drakes, sea drakes still lack the mental acuity of their true dragon forebears, though they remain as brutally cunning as other drakes. Although amphibious, sea drakes spend the majority of their time in shallow coastlines waters. Sea drakes are up to 14 feet long from their noses to the tips of their powerful tails. They weigh 2,000 pounds. The most solitary of all drakes, sea drakes prefer to hunt alone. Occasionally, however, they band together in packs to hunt larger prey. Such rampages can be a significant danger to coastlines shipping.",2400
Sea Giant,10,humanoid,waters,This huge being has bluish green skin and eyes that reflect light like two silvery moons. Rippling with muscle this creature rises from the depths with a crash of waves on rocks.,"Sea giants are the reclusive cousins of storm giants. They are most often found in the deepest depths of the seas where they make their dwelling in the cones of long dead undersea volcanoes. Sea giants have a druid like power over the forces of the seas, and are a living embodiment of its bounty and destructive wrath. Sea giants seldom come into contact with surface dwellers, but have been known on rare occasions to exact bounties from coastlines cities to insure the safety of its navies and merchant vessels. Sea giants are most commonly encountered within a few hundred miles of their lair, tending to their domain and battling off incursions of sahaugin, aboleth, krakens and other such destructive forces of the undersea. An adult male sea giant stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 6,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Both have sea green skin, dark green or black hair, and silver eyes. Sea giants adorn themselves in loose flowing robes of white, blue, or green. Mwear wreathes of coral in their hair. When battling at the surface of the seas, sea giants hurl rocks at great length against opposing ranged attackers, usually including crews of siege engines. When battling against surface ships their tactic is to disguise themselves by creating rough waters with their control waters ability. They then hammer the hull with their mighty fists until it is holed, without ever revealing themselves to the crew. Once holed, they tear the hull apart and drown the crew. When fighting beneath the waves they use their crushing pressure special ability to increase the waters pressure around themselves in an effort to destroy interlopers and trespassers. Sea Giant Characters Sea giants must possess fourteen levels of humanoid before taking class levels. Sea giants are usually barbarians or clerics.

Sea Hag,4,monstrous humanoid,waters,"Hair like rotting seaweed drapes this ancient witch. Loose, algae-colored skin sags off her starved frame.","Monstrous sea witches, these wicked hags possess terrifying features that few dare look upon. Reveling in discord, the foul creatures drag sailors to watersy graves and torment the peoples of the oceans with wicked promises. Sea hags are always terrible to look upon, and despite their gluttonous ways, they are usually emaciated creatures who look half-starved. Most stand about 6 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds. Sea hags prefer to dwell relatively close to shore where fishermen and trading vessels are more commonly encountered. Most choose to live far from urban areas so that their acts don't draw as much attention from would-be enemies, but it's not uncommon for a particularly brave or eager sea hag to settle in a city harbor or in the mouth of a deep rivers. Sea hags form covens similar to other hags, but their waters nature generally keeps them from forming mixed covens. In the case of a shorelinedwelling green hag , a coven often consists of two sea hags who look to the green hag as their mother and leader. More commonly, a sea hag coven consists of a group of particularly friendly and sisterly sea hags. See page 167 for more details on hag covens.",1200
Sea Scourge,6,ooze,warm oceans,"This whitish-gray amoeboid creature has bits of flotsam embedded in its amorphous form, which moves inexorably against the current.","On watch at night in warm seas, wise sailors are especially vigilant for the hated sea scourge, an ooze that has adapted itself so well to its maritime habitat as to become a significant hazard to native oceansic creatures as well as to humanoid seafarers. While its typical diet consists of sea turtles, dugongs, and other waters prey, the sea scourge will feed on whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold of, and is known to prey on humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going so far as to board seagoing vessels. A sea scourge's acid is capable of dissolving wood in addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a sea scourge more often tends to search the surface of the oceans for prey, camouf laged as a large clump of ambergris or other seaborne excretion. Variant Sea Scourges Most sea scourges are encountered off the western coast of Garund in the Arcadian oceans, but some breeds have been known to stalk other parts of the high seas. Coldwaters Scourge : Stalking the watersy expanses of the northern Arcadian oceans and Inner Sea, the coldwaters scourge is a menace to merchant ships and war galleons alike. A coldwaters scourge is immune to cold damage, and creatures that fail their Ref lex saves versus the scourge's acid jet are also staggered for 1 round. Steaming Scourge : The steaming scourge plagues the open waters of the Obari oceans, sapping the life from unsuspecting marine animals as well as unwary fisherfolk and small seaside settlements. A steaming scourge possesses additional Hit Dice and the heat universal monster ability, and emits so much energy that waters in a 10-foot-radius spread around it begins to boil, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures that begin their turn submerged in it.",2400
Sea Serpent,12,magical beast,oceans,"Spine-frilled neck arching up from the waters like a snake ready to strike, this ship-sized serpent hisses a challenge.","Tales of immense sea serpents have colored the accounts of seagoing folk since the first ship sailed beyond sight of land. Yet proof of these immense and elusive creatures is remarkably difficult to come by, for not only is the oceans vast and the true sea serpent rare, but these creatures are quite adept at both avoiding capture and destroying ships bent on such a daunting task. Due to the sea serpent's hermitic nature, msailors take to ascribing the sighting of such a beast to an omen, although whether the sighting portends peril or providence depends as much upon the ship's morale as it does anything else-the sea serpent itself has little interest in prophecy, and only its hunger determines how dangerous its proximity to a curious ship can be. Although sea serpents are little more than animals, they possess about them an air of mysticism that even old salts and cynics are forced to admit quickens the heart and buoys  the spirit. Reports of sea serpent sightings are just as likely to encourage travel as they are to cause panic among seafarers, as explorers and adventurers flock to the site in hopes of sighting such a legendary creature. Typical sea serpents are 60 feet in length and weigh 4,500 pounds, but their upward size limit is unknown. Certainly, the sea is a vast and mysterious place more than capable of supporting whales and other such l e v i a t h a n s , and tales of sea serpents that exceed lengths of 300 feet or more are not unheard of. You can generate statistics for a sea serpent of such tremendous size by applying the advanced simple template or the giant simple template to the statistics presented here. Alternatively, you can advance this sea serpent to Colossal size, increasing its Hit Dice to 25 and its CR to 18.",19200
Sea Snake,1,animal,oceans,This scaly blue-green snake skims the surface of the waters in a sinuous ballet of muscle and agility.,"This nasty waters-dwelling creature is a particular bane to fisherfolk in tropical seas, occasionally getting caught up in their nets and striking angrily at unwary sailors as they spill their catch out onto the deck. The sea snake tends to follow schools of fish and pick off stragglers, choosing to hunt smaller prey instead of larger foes and only attacking more formidable enemies if it feels threatened. A sea snake's anatomy is particularly well adapted to its environment, and its single lung takes up its entire length. The average sea snake is 4 feet long from tail to head and weighs 10 pounds.",400
Sea Spider,11,magical beast,waters,"This creature resembles similar arachnids found on land. Its color ranges through various shades of blue and green with distinct black markings. Its legs and bodies are covered with thousands of fine, sticky hairs.","The hairs on a sea spider's legs trap air bubbles, which aid in floatation and mobility. With its long, strong legs a sea spider can propel itself underwaters as easily as it can glide upon the surface. Sea spiders make their lairs in shallow underwaters caverns in secluded lagoons of uninhabited islands. They never leave the sea as they cannot long stand the stillness of dry land. Sea spiders survive on a diet of plants, coral, and undersea denizens, preferring shark and eel to other waters life. A meal is devoured immediately, though not necessarily digested immediately. A sea spider has an extra stomach in which it stores food for later digestion. This allows the spider to go long periods of time between meals. A sea spider is about 16 feet long and resembles a monstrous spider with fur of varying hues of blues and greens. Sea spiders never venture on land, confining their attacks to ships. They usually attach themselves to the ship with the sticky hairs of their hind legs. This brings their mouth to the level of the deck where they may bite the ship, trying to disable it, or person in close range. Their forelegs are free to swing at opponents. If no one is in range, the sea spider relocates to another area of the ship and attack again. Their primary tactic is to grapple opponents and draw them to the mouth, attempting to swallow them whole. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.",12800
Seal,0.33,animal,oceans,"This sleek, waters mammal has a pair of flippered limbs, a powerful tail, and a muzzle full of small sharp teeth.","Sleek-bodied waters mammals, seals spend the majority of their lives in the waters, whether in the harbors of tropical ports or amid wandering icebergs. They prefer rocky beaches, upon which they rest, raise their young, and dive to hunt fish, squid, sea birds, and other small waters creatures. They are well known for their vocal communications consisting of barks, grunts, and flipper slaps, traits that cause mhumanoids to remark on their intelligence and the ease with which they can be trained.",135
Seaweed Leshy,3,plant,oceans or coastlines,This vaguely humanoid plant creature has a body formed of soggy green seaweed and wears crude armor made from seashells.,"Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of waters indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwaters plant life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwaters leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy. Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterslogged green humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair of large clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for other creature. Patient and thoughtful by inclination , seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the rivers. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring. GROWING A SEAWEED LESHY Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawaters. The leshy's maker plants a strand of kelp or other seaweed in the waters and treats it daily with bone ash to encourage algal growth. When first created, a seaweed leshy has no armor, but can construct it from available materials given a day and left to its own devices .

Seaweed Siren,13,magical beast,coastlines,"This creature's three singing heads sway atop serpentine necks that extend from a bulbous body split by a wide, toothy mouth. Pungent strands of seaweed cover the creature like slimy hair.","On first glance, this creature appears to blur the line between plant and animal. Three eyeless heads sway above the central body mass, constantly singing, chanting, and speaking in nonsense languages and simple babble. Seaweed covers the creature's three false heads and its main central body-a form of camouf lage to help the beast remain hidden while hunting. Six stout, crablike legs carry this creature along the coast and through the rocky tide pools it inhabits. A seaweed siren stands over 8 feet tall from the tip of its stubby legs to the top of its heads, and is nearly 7 feet in diameter. The creature weighs upward of 3,500 pounds. Ecology Seaweed sirens hunt near the shore, where they wait for clam diggers strolling the beaches, lone fisherfolk, or even passing ships. Once a seaweed siren spots its prey, the creature lurks just under the waters and allows its three strange heads to protrude above the surface. The swaying heads sing songs and babble in strange nonsense languages to fuel the seaweed siren's mspecial abilities. Even when not in use against a potential meal, the heads seemingly converse with each other, holding lengthy conversations full of random syllables and made-up words. Once it draws its prey near, the seaweed siren attempts to charm or bewilder its foe to gain the advantage. After this, the creature moves closer and begins to devour its still-living victim. While the seaweed siren prefers to dine on living humanoids, it uses its strident squall attacks to incapacitate or kill prey that flees or resists its charm attempts. Seaweed sirens use a form of aggressive mimicry, appearing to have humanoid features in order to lure in their preferred meals. A seaweed siren's heads are nothing more than appendages. While they have mouths the creature can breathe through, it doesn't eat using these mouths. Seaweed sirens' heads grow differently depending on where the creature developed in order to match the skin tone and apparent ethnicity of the surrounding humanoid population. In addition, the heads are eyeless-the siren sees using the meyes on its main body mass. A seaweed siren's eyes twist and spin within their sockets when the creature uses its terrible gaze attack. When seaweed sirens can't find their favored food- intelligent creatures and humanoids-they can subsist on fish, but they prefer waters mammals as an alternative. Seals and sea otters find their way into a seaweed siren's mouth most often, but the creature must actively hunt those morsels, as its particular bait is ineffective against the animals and more likely to scare them off than to lure them closer. Some sailors report larger and more dangerous variations of the seaweed siren. If these reports are true, some seaweed sirens measure twice the size of regular ones, and possess more than three heads and more powerful abilities. Habitat & Society Seaweed sirens live solitary lives, rarely if ever encountering others of their kind. It's unclear to scholars how these creatures procreate, but they must have some method, since they've been spotted along Golarion's coastlines for thousands of years. Some who research the strange monsters pose the theory that seaweed sirens birth their young from thick leathery shells, much like turtle eggs or fibrous seeds. Seaweed sirens sometimes ally themselves with other waters creatures to share in hunts or for mutual protection. Sahuagin typically don't trust the seaweed sirens, nor do they have the patience to work too closely with the creatures for long, but they have been known to befriend a seaweed siren and work with it long enough to capture new slaves and restock their humanoid food supply. Locathah sometimes use these strange beasts as protectors, keeping the seaweed sirens well fed in return for the creatures serving as lookouts and sentinels. Merfolk and waters elves avoid seaweed sirens, and even go so far as to sometimes warn other humanoid communities when one is discovered to be hunting nearby. A seaweed siren can speak Aklo, and constantly babbles in glossolalia, but if it manages to talk with another sentient being that has a language long enough, it begins mimicking the other's language and speech patterns, eventually sounding exactly like it. Though a seaweed siren can use its tongues spell to understand and speak language, it prefers to talk with and mimic its conversational partners without resorting to using this ability. Some speculate the creature catalogs every conversation in order to add to the collection of sounds and words that power its cacophony special ability.",25600
Selkie,5,monstrous humanoid,oceans,"This beautiful woman changes shape rapidly to become a sleek, waters creature with a gray hide of short fur. Her webbed hands end in sharp claws, and her jaws open unnaturally wide to reveal pointed teeth.","Selkies are clever and brutal seal-like humanoids that often inhabit the colder oceans of the world. Although capable predators, selkies are best known for their mysterious shapechanging ability, which allows them to come ashore in the guise of land dwellers and even live among other races before luring their victims beneath the waves to drown. In its natural form, a selkie has webbed, clawed hands and a muscular trunk ending in broad flippers. A selkie's head is a blend of human and seal, with large eyes and a mouth full of curved teeth. Selkies' coats range from chestnut brown to slate, dappled with darker spots of gray. Male selkies grow to a length of 6-1/2 feet, but can weigh up to 300 pounds because of the extra fat the creatures need to survive in colder climes. Females are slightly shorter and slimmer. Selkies typically live up to 75 years. Ecology Selkies can inhabit waters of climate, but are best adapted to live in colder oceans and inlets. A selkie's body is extremely well muscled, but those muscles sit beneath a sheaf of fat that insulates the creature in places where even saltwaters freezes. This natural resilience to cold is so strong that even magical frost and ice can bounce harmlessly off of a selkie's hide. Selkies prey mostly on watersfowl, fish, and other small marine animals. When traveling in packs, selkies have been known to kill and eat large sharks and even small whales, but this is rare, as a selkie's need to keep its arms at its sides while swimming hinders the use of its claws when hunting. A selkie's webbed fingers are flexible, with opposable thumbs, but the creatures normally use their claws only when locked in combat with either a competing predator or particularly resilient prey. Usually, however, a selkie's bite is more than enough to repel attackers or bring down enemies. A selkie's jaw is flexible, and can open to almost 160 degrees, allowing it to clamp down on prey even larger than itself. Additionally, as selkies do not have the necessary molars to grind meat, the creatures shake their prey in an effort to tear and shred their food into more digestible pieces. For this reason, the muscles along a selkie's neck are among the most powerful in its body. Selkies also have supernatural powers at their disposal. All selkies can change their shape at will, shifting to take the form of humanoid close to their size or slightly smaller. Some selkies use this ability to slip quietly into coastlines settlements or onto large ships to steal food or other useful items such as nets. More often, though, selkies use their shapechanging abilities for mischief. A favorite tactic of selkies is to take the shape of a young woman or child and then thrash through the waters near ships or piers, begging for help. When someone attempting to rescue the imperiled person gets close enough, the selkie returns to its natural form to attack. Especially malevolent selkies use this tactic in packs, letting one of their own act as bait while the others attack rescuers, making their presence known so that the apparent victim's danger seems all the more real. Selkies are aided in their efforts to trick and beguile others by their uncanny ability to mimic human emotions when speaking. This ability allows selkies to add the perfect intonation, pitch, and emphasis to words they speak, making it difficult for listeners to disbelieve even the most outlandish stories and tales. Habitat & Society The true nature and origin of selkies puzzle scholars the world over. Observers first thought them to be a rare breed of oceansic lycanthropes, while others thought they were merfolk who had learned the arcane arts of transmutation. While mof these theories are nothing more than stories, varied rumors persist, with almost every coastlines town and village claiming its own myths regarding the origin of the selkies to be the truth. Selkies enjoy propagating these stories during their time ashore and are usually the source of the most outlandish claims about their own nature, such as the tale that their ability to change shape comes from slipping out of a separate skin to enjoy their human form. Despite their mischievous and often cruel ways, mselkies journey onto shore out of simple loneliness. In the oceans, selkies are solitary for the majority of their lives. Males and females come together brief ly during their spring mating season, when the female gorges herself on food of all kinds and then finds a secluded cave or beach to birth a single pup. The mother then fasts as her pup nurses, feeding off the stored and accumulated fat she attained during mating season. After a few weeks, the pup is ready to swim and hunt alongside its mother, but most selkies are abandoned to hunt and live on their own after 2 to 3 years. Younger selkies then form packs with others of their kind until they can strike out on their own. The selkie lifecycle can have a profound effect on individuals, driving some to bouts of intense cruelty out of a sense of survivalist necessity. These selkies enjoy tricking land dwellers into the waters to drown or eat them, and often don the guise of an attractive man or woman to entice a victim into the waves for a moonlight swim. Other selkies, however, do not recover from the early abandonment of their mothers and spend the rest of their lives searching for the compof others and a place to belong. These selkies sometimes use their shapechanging abilities to come ashore and live among other humanoids. In this guise, selkies live, love, and often marry land dwellers, sometimes living the rest of their lives on land. Children of such unions never emerge as selkies but feel an unexplainable yearning for the sea, and often become sailors or fisherfolk so they might quell this strange desire.",1600
Sentient Wax Golem,4,construct,any,"This eerily expressionless man has a glistening quality about him, as though he were completely covered in an oily sheen. His clothes' colors are unsaturated and bland, his skin slightly gray, and his features and lines unnaturally soft.","A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking, well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person. A wax golem can be constructed to resemble person or creature, though they typically look like human subjects, standing at the same height and weighing about three times as much. Ecology Wax golems are often constructed by artistic spellcasters who fancy making their work a little more authenticlooking. Though these golems can look like anything from faceless, colorless drones to finely detailed reconstructions, they all share the commonality of being formed purely from hard wax. Most wax golem crafters choose to create these lifelike statues not for aesthetic purposes, however, but to undertake devious chores such as infiltration, espionage, or assassination. Habitat & Society Wax golems possess the mysterious ability of possibly gaining self-awareness, an attribute almost exclusively reserved for humanoid creatures born of natural means. By resembling a subject so greatly, wax golems have a small chance of gaining conscious thought and higher-level thinking, effectively manifesting their own sentience. This extraordinary ability has no logical explanation, though some constructors of these beings who have witnessed this transformation theorize that wax golems obtain self-awareness by watching humanoids over an extended period of time. Wax golems that spend a significant amount of time around people who mistake them for the subjects they resemble  have an even greater chance of gaining sentience. Oddly, wax golems that gain sentience also develop the genuine belief that they are who they are modeled after. This notion is so strong that if such a wax golem were to encounter the individual it is modeled after, it would go to great lengths to exterminate the person and take his or her place in society, even adopting a code of morals and principles similar to those of the murdered subject. In this way, wax golems stealthily inject themselves into roles as diplomats, leaders, and authority figures, often to the detriment of people close to the usurped individual. So meticulously designed are wax golems, however, that few can identify a wax golem as a fraud, even when in close proximity. Along with sentience, wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep, or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this, wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing one person to get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift in demeanor. Environmental hazards such as heat from the sun or cold precipitation have little effect on wax golems, though constant exposure to temperatures over 100 degrees for more than an hour does produce a rather odd sheen, and spending longer than a day in such weather begins to take its toll on the golem, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage every hour spent in the elements after the first. Construction The construction of a wax golem requires a block of solid wax the size of whatever individual it is to be molded after, typically weighing over 1,000 pounds. The wax is treated with dyes and magical unguents worth at least 500 gp. The simplest wax golems require the creator to make a Craft  check, with wax golems resembling specific races or individuals requiring higher DCs. While wax golems that look like living creatures possess greater versatility, they also have the potential of gaining a strange sort of sentience.

Its 30-foot body is nearly two-feet thick and covered in muddy brown scales with strange patterns and symbols on its dorsal side. Large glowing yellow orbs set in its wide, triangular head emit a haunting glare and arching its tail aggressively, it exposes a vicious-looking barbed stinger.","Wizards and other sages well-versed in arcane lore agree that the sepia snake was the inspiration for the spell sepia snake sigil. The similarities between the creature and the spell are simply too great to be coincidental. Though a sepia snake can be found just about anywhere, it usually makes its lair deep underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or subterranean caverns. It has been said that to look into the eyes of the sepia snake is to look into one's own doom. A sepia snake begins combat by using its gaze on what it believes to be its most dangerous opponents so it can safely deal with them later. In melee a sepia snake tries to avoid direct combat, and will rely on its Flyby Attack feat to keep it out of danger. A sepia snake can emit a brown, web-like substance from its throat that immobilizes its opponent. Held, cocooned, or otherwise incapacitated foes are poisoned to soften them up for consumption.

Sepulchral Guardian,8,construct,any,A humanoid wearing iron armor stands before you. In its hand it holds a wickedly sharp longsword. Its eyes show no signs of life.,"Sepulchral guardians are specially constructed guardians created from the preserved corpses of dead humanoids that have been encased in iron. They are created for one purpose and one purpose only: to guard the final resting place of a now dead creature. Once activated, a sepulchral guardian performs its task until it is destroyed. Even the death of its creator does not disrupt a sepulchral guardian as mare created to guard the final resting place of the one that created them. A sepulchral guardian appears as a humanoid standing just over 6 feet tall. Its entire body, save its face is encased in a suit of iron. Its face, while humanoid, shows no signs of life, and its eyes are filled with the emptiness of an automaton. Most sepulchral guardians wield longswords, battleaxes, or other such weapons. A sepulchral guardian weighs about 900 pounds. Sepulchral guardians cannot speak and do not utter sound. Sepulchral guardians attack with deadly accuracy, relying on either a longsword or their powerful fists in battle. They are relentless combatants and attack until destroyed or until their foes are slain or driven from the area they are protecting.

Seraptis,15,outsider,any,"This demonic woman's flesh is pale and clammy, as if her body had been drained of blood via the numerous deep, raw slashes upon her four arms. As she moves, these gashes open like mouths, displaying row upon row of razor-sharp teeth.","Statuesque and hauntingly beautiful , seraptis demons are the favored minions of the demon lord Sif kesh, although they also often serve other demon lords . Formidable combatants, seraptis demons typically function as bodyguards or lone champions for their masters, but mof these demons have achieved greater glory on their own as rulers of subdomains in greater Abyssal realms. A seraptis demon stands 7 feet tall and weighs 230 pounds. Ecology Seraptis demons form from the souls of those who, in the act of committing suicide, caused an unusual amount of despair, destruction, or mayhem. A quiet death in a dark room might result in the soul becoming a seraptis if the victim was a wellknown and beloved political figure whose suicide compelled his followers to riot and murder. A plunge from a high tower into a crowded marketplace might result in a small amount of collateral damage if the jumper lands atop a passerby, but this would not normally doom the suicide to existence as a seraptis. Suicide by detonating a necklace of fireballs in the middle of a wedding, on the other hand, would likely result in the dead soul becoming a seraptis. With one exception, those who deliberately commit suicide in an attempt to have their souls transform into seraptis demons instead find themselves manifesting upon the Abyss as larvae-the Abyss does not reward deliberate suicide with such power as a seraptis wields. The one exception is in the case of a powerful worshiper of the demon lord Sif kesh. The ritual by which such a worshiper can transcend mortal life and transform into a seraptis is one of the cult's most closely guarded secrets, and one that is only revealed to the most heretical and deviant of the faithful. Seraptis demons formed in this manner always retain their previous life's personality and memories, although they lose all class-based abilities in the transition. Habitat & Society Although the seraptis champions and assassins who serve Sif kesh and other demon lords are well feared, the true terrors of their kind are those who have broken free from servitude to more powerful demons and, in so doing, have established themselves as ruling forces. Known collectively as the Dolorous Sisters, these demons are all advanced serapti with several class levels, ranging from CR 19 to CR 22. These seraptis demons are all ex-worshipers of Sif kesh who have undergone the secret suicide ritual to transform into demons, but in true heretical style, they no longer directly serve the Sacred Whore. None have yet ascended to the vaunted rank of nascent demon lord, for the Dolorous Sisters hope to someday transcend as a group into a full-f ledged demon lord by undertaking a hideous suicide pact, bypassing the convoluted and dangerous step of nascence most demon lords must endure. In true Abyssal form, though, the Dolorous Sisters have long been plagued by internal bickering, treachery, and clandestine assassinations. They require 23 members before they can even begin their suicide ritual, and while the sisters' numbers have grown steadily  since their initial formation eons ago, they have yet to reach that key number. The Dolorous Sisters do not dwell together-rather, they keep palaces built upon different themes that match their own favored methods of suicide scattered throughout the Abyssal cities of Diovengia, Vantian, and Yanaron, as well as various cities located on remote Midnight Isles. Portals sometimes connect some of these palaces as alliances grow between the demons, yet the constant threat of betrayal ensures that these portals remain among the most heavily guarded parts of each domicile.",51200

Yet despite this, the majority of serpentfolk today are degenerates who have devolved to the point of primeval savagery and have lost much of their magical legacy- more civilized serpentfolk generally regard these degenerates with shame and disdain. Serpentfolk are 6 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds. Degenerates are only 5 feet tall but weigh 200 pounds. All serpentfolk are quite long-lived, and generally live to the age of 500. Advanced Serpentfolk When a serpentfolk gains class levels, several of its abilities increase as well, as detailed below. • Spell Resistance equals total Hit Dice + 10. • Poison bite save DC equals 10 + Con modifier + 1/2 total Hit Dice. • When it is 4th level in class combination, it gains two spell-like abilities usable once per day each: dominate person and major image. When it reaches 9th level in combination, it gains two more usable once per day each: mass suggestion and teleport. • A serpentfolk's racial ability score modifiers are as follows: Str -2, Dex +10, Con +6, Int +8, Wis +4, Cha +6. Degenerate Serpentfolk Degenerate serpentfolk possess the same statistics as normal serpentfolk, save for the following adjustments. • They have no spell-like abilities. • They lose the +4 racial bonus on Use Magic Device checks, but gain a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks. • Their natural armor bonus increases from +3 to +7. • They have the following ability score modifiers: Str +10, Dex +2, Con +8, Int -6 , Wis +2, Cha -4. A typical degenerate serpentfolk's ability scores are Str 20, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha 6.",1200

Severed Head,0.33,undead,any,"This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.","Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how mcan be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in way and applied to of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching : A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type  chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning : This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn  special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing : This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming : Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chillsing scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming skull's Cha modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same beheaded's scream for 24 hours.",135
Shackled Sorcerers,5,humanoid,oceans or coastlines,"Clad in multicolored silks, this fierce-looking woman seems ready to unleash devastating sorcery upon enemy vessels and waters-dwelling monsters alike.","For the vast majority of ships, the shackled sorcerer provides the main artillery in skirmishes, sending sheets of flame at enemy vessels or targeting burly, hostile sailors with blasts of arcane might from the rear of a boarding party. Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth, knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however, pirates do all they can to protect their magic-wielding allies from harm, knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and swinging from a gibbet. The majority of shackled sorcerers are considered officers, but they rarely assume traditional positions of authority such as a captain's first mate. Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are highly prized among sea-faring magic-wielders. While the bloodlines of shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at sea-including the waters or Stormborn bloodlines-gifted arcane casters who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships.",1600

Shadow Demon,7,outsider,any,Only this shadowy bat-winged demon's teeth and claws have sense of physicality to them-the rest is lost in darkness.,"Shadow demons resemble standard shadows with wings. They are the incorporeal form of a demon trapped in the form of a shadow as punishment for some wrongdoing. If anything can release a demon trapped in shadow form, only the dukes, princes, and lords of the Abyss know such secrets. As a result of their new form, shadow demons are malign and evil, destroying all life they encounter. A shadow demon lurks in dark places, waiting for its prey to pass nearby. Often before leaping to attack, it uses its deeper darkness to gain the advantage. It then leaps from the shadows and attacks with its incorporeal attacks. It selects the most powerful foe in a group and uses its magic jar against it. A shadow demon's natural weapons, as well as weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Shadow Giant,13,humanoid,any,"This giant's skin is dead black, and it wears a gold-inlaid breastplate, a headdress, and armbands decorated with skulls.","Though their kind originated on the Plane of Shadow, several families of shadow giants have relocated to the wilder regions of Nidal at the invitation of the Umbral Court. They serve as a compof elite shock troops, kept a close secret and only used in operations where they are not expected to leave survivors to tell the tale. Most shadow giants are especially taciturn and keep to themselves when not called to duty by the Umbral Court. They keep their own counsel and practice their own mysterious religion, whose bloody rituals of autosacrifice and cannibalism are presided over by their bone-and-feather-adorned shamans atop short-stepped pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to combine together to form greater tribes when times of war are at hand. Such an army arrayed upon the field of battle is often enough to make enemies sue for peace with offers of gold and prisoners for sacrifice.",25600
Shadow Mastiff,5,outsider,any,This muscular canine has a maw full of sharp teeth and an inky black coat that almost seems to drink in the light around it.,"Tireless hunters, stealthy trackers, and deadly predators, shadow mastiffs stalk the dark corners of the Outer Planes, preying upon all beings that stray from the light. These beasts have little in common with actual canines aside from their general forms , their bodies being the evolution of countless centuries hunting the most merciless wildernesses of the Outer Planes and the Shadow Plane. On the Material Plane, they prefer to travel in shadow, moving soundlessly and unseen to find prey, hunting in vicious sport just as often as in hunger. Shadow mastiffs stand over 4 feet tall, with most weighing nearly 300 pounds. In combat, these stealthy beasts prefer to fight in shadows; they shy from areas of bright light unless faced with no other choice and use their bay to force their enemies to flee from well-lit areas. Shadow mastiffs prefer to hunt in groups, using pack tactics to lure prey into traps and to draw it away from sources of light. They do not make lairs, and are usually not found with sort of treasure, unless it is on the body of a recently slain victim. Shadow mastiffs are popular guardians among spellcasters capable of conjuring them via lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding. Undead spellcasters and evil outsiders are immune to shadow mastiffs' fearful bay; others who are not immune might intentionally expose themselves to the creatures' bay at some point during the daylight hours when the resulting panic won't directly impact other tasks. As a general rule, it's safe to assume that site using shadow mastiffs as guardians has already been affected by the bay, and that its inhabitants are thus immune to the ability's effects for the remaining 24 hours of that day. Larger shadow mastiffs exist-creatures the size of horses or even bigger. These creatures have different shapes, looking less like dogs and more like larger creatures such as lions, dinosaurs, or even dragons. Such creatures have additional racial Hit Dice, and could even have extra abilities such as flight or breath weapons.",1600

Shadowgarm,2,aberration,any,"This amorphous creature loosely resembles a cross between a large snake and an insect. It has black oily skin, and parts of its very flesh blend seamlessly into the shadows. Its constantly moving, writhing form makes it difficult to identify from a distance.","Shadowgarms are strange monsters from the Plane of Shadow, where they function as lowly predators and pests somewhat akin to the Material Plane's coyotes, leopards, and similar hunting mammals. Yet to a creature unfamiliar with the workings of the Plane of Shadow, the shadowgarm is a hideous and frightening beast. Generally lairing in ruined sections of towns or dead-end alleys clogged with refuse during the day, they come out at night to prey upon creatures that stray too far from the safety of light. These aberrant predators ""leak"" into the Material Plane anywhere the Plane of Shadow's influence is strong. Small groups of shadowgarms are occasionally seen lurking in old graveyards where undead  are known to reside, and anywhere that has strong traditions of shadow magic tends to have a healthy population of shadowgarms lurking in out-of-the-way areas as well. The typical shadowgarm measures about 4-1/2 feet long and weighs approximately 90 pounds, their bodies being strangely light, composed of a spongy dark matter and seemingly wisps of shadow itself. Some, however, grow to be much larger, though shadowgarms of all sizes prove especially adept at blending in among the shadows and detritus of their hunting grounds or crawling into crevices it seems creatures of their size would not be able to squeeze. Ecology Strange beings with a little-understood physiology, shadowgarms prove endlessly hungry, taking sustenance from shadow as if it were waters and drawing nutrition from the flesh of other creatures as their only source of food. Shadowgarms can eat and digest sort of animal matter, from flesh to bone, converting them into little more than smoke and shadow. A creature left to a shadowgarm to feed upon leaves behind nothing but trappings of metal and similarly solid accessories. A shadowgarm's physical form seems strangely fluid, proving slightly malleable and generalized. No two shadowgarms appear exactly alike, and even individuals of the race seem to gradually change, all the faster in areas of deep shadows. Regardless of their endless, fluid alterations, they retain three primary clawed appendages, which serve them in consuming meals and fighting. Their number of feelers or tentacle-like legs, however, is constantly in flux, numbering but two or three one moment and then multiplying to dozens the next. Shadowgarms do not have a mouth and hardly have heads to speak off-possessing only slight knobby protuberances that seem to have little role in guiding their motions. When ingesting matter, they slowly dissolve their meals, their bodies breaking down organic substance they choose by resting upon their meal for a matter of moments. The entire process might be likened to a body-wide ingestion process similar to that of a fly, as matter is dissolved and subsumed by the shadowy hunter's bulk. Once every several months, the urge to mate descends upon shadowgarms like a mass racial insanity. At this time, their natural aversion to their own kind is overwhelmed by a need to procreate. Shadowgarms are hemaphroditic, but cannot fertilize themselves- when a shadowgarm gathering begins, these creatures congregate in groups of up to a dozen, remaining in close proximity to each other for days at a time. The cycle that drives shadowgarm gatherings is nothing connected to the Material Plane-most scholars have been unable to determine what pattern the timing follows, if indeed there is a pattern at all. Habitat & Society Although shadowgarms are quite active at all times on the Plane of Shadow, the realities of the Material Plane force them into the niche of nocturnal predator. Yet despite their hatred of light, they seem to need it in some strange way. Observers have noted that the creatures prefer to stand in actual shadows, rather than just in darkness, and seem to savor the ever-changing nature of the shadows themselves. It may be that shadowgarms abhor total darkness as much as light, though neither bright light nor utter darkness causes them physical harm. Most shadowgarms' hunts take place under the light of the full moon, or in the shadowy hours of dusk or dawn. In cities where shadowgarms are common, they naturally gravitate to sewers or narrow alleys. This allows them the easiest way to quickly strike at unwary victims from above or below. They do not build sort of true nest or lair, preferring to remain constantly afoot in search of new prey. As shadowgarms have no fear of falling, they often clamber up to corners and niches at the tops of tunnels or just under rooftop overhangs, both to avoid bright light that might be shining down from above and to lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey that walks underneath. This leads to the discovery of shadowgarms in truly unexpected and unnerving places, like in bell towers, within attics and crawl spaces, and even hidden amid cracks and loose shingles in old roofing. More than one child's tale of boogiemen or strange shapes lurking outside their windows might actually be attributed to the daring nocturnal wanderings of shadowgarms. Shadowgarms are incredibly territorial, and usually do not nest together except during their mating gathering. Shadowgarms immediately confront one another upon meeting. Pickpockets and other street urchins often share wild tales of shadowgarms battling fiercely in the alleyways and nighted dens, fighting with raw savagery instead of their more customary stealth. Some canny streetfolk use this territorial nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by these lurking hunters without being attacked. Of course, this tactic doesn't work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as directing one's attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows. On rare occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to prey upon the ship's crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with nothing living on board.",600
Shae,4,outsider,any,A white porcelain mask and elegant white clothing provide form and contrast to this shadowy woman's body.,"The mysterious people known as the shaes are natives of the Shadow Plane. In their own language, their name means ""unbound"" or ""unfettered."" According to shae history, they were once humanoids who through tireless study and self-perfection managed to transcend the bonds of a definite form. Though they still bear roughly humanoid shapes, shaes' outlines are perpetually wispy and impossible for non-shaes to focus directly on. Though shaes may engage in all the same pursuits and professions as other humanoids, their overwhelming racial pride often leads them to see all other humanoids- especially humans-as lesser beings. Ironically, this casual disdain sometimes leads individual shaes to gather harems of worshipful human consorts, and it is from these unions that fetchlings often issue. Humans involved in such relationships often hope to learn the secret of the shaes' power over shadows, and claim that only in sacred union with the creatures can one glimpse their true features. Shaes are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. They often wear masks and form-fitting clothing when around other creatures in order to give the lesser beings something to focus on .",1200

They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants with a fondness for elf flesh in particular. What serve as a shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper body. Shambling mounds typically have an 8-foot girth and stand between 6 and 9 feet tall. They weigh about 3,800 pounds. Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more akin to animate tangles of creeping parasitic vines than single rooted plants. They are omnivorous, able to draw their sustenance from nearly anything, wrapping their creepers around living trees to draw forth the sap, sending rootlets into the soil to absorb raw nutrients, or consuming flesh and bone from crushed prey. Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native environments. Blending in with the surrounding terrain, they can lie in wait for days on end without moving, waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could be almost anywhere at time, attacking without warning and not caring whether it leaves survivors, so long as it acquires its next meal. Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic existences in deep forests and fetid swamps, although they can also be found underground living among damp fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of shamblers gathering in strange congregations around great earthen mounds in the depths of marshes and jungles, often during the height of violent electrical storms.

Mshantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible. A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds.

Shifty Nobles,2,humanoid,urban,"This well-dressed noble carries herself with poise, and her eyes seem to catalog everything she observes.","The shifty noble represents one of the dozens of aristocrats vying for power and wealth in Magnimar. Some nobles may hail from families with a long lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers. In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the region. When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 ar and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most inf luential and significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled by blasé nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine. While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up, corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's holdings. Mof the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent threats to the city.",600
Shikigami,2,outsider,any,"This tiny, crudely carved statue of a robed man has glowing runes running across its surface.","Shikigami are the least of the kami, yet they make up for their lowly status with their loyalty and bravery. Unlike most other well-known types of kami, shikigami are more often associated with rural and urban regions than with natural settings. These kami are the protectors of the minor works of civilization-things like milestones, waymarkers, tiny garden statues, and other relatively mundane works of art crafted by humanoid hands. No two shikigami look exactly alike, as bef its a race of kami that associates with such a wide range of wards. While all shikigami have the ability to merge with their wards, these kami are also fond of spending time in their physical forms, watching over their wards either invisibly or in the form of a tiny statue. In combat, a shikigami fights with whatever objects it finds at hand. Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than they should. Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other kami, but they are quick to leave an area they see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt the virtues of nature. When they do, they generally take their wards with them. They do not engage humanoids who desecrate the environment, but their absence leaves a profound mark on the morale of perceptive villagers. Should the shikigami leave, town officials who know the function of the miniature kami are quick to change policies in their community to ref lect a more naturalistic approach, hoping to rekindle the relationship between shikigami and people, lest the community fall into the disfavor of more powerful and less passive kami. Shikigami typically stand 2 feet tall and weigh 30 pounds, or 50 pounds when taking their statue forms. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, an alignment of lawful neutral, and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a shikigami familiar. Whenever a shikigami becomes a familiar, it treats its master as its ward.",600
Shinigami,17,outsider,any,"This emaciated, robed humanoid wields a scythe made of bone to match the skeletal wings that protrude from its shoulders.","Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death, shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their work and do not seek to impose suffering-although there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by their kin as ""rogue shinigamis,"" subscribe to either more merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami.

Beyond the flares of energy that constantly burst from their forms , the creatures are vaguely humanoid, with strange hands that each bear four fingers. Occasionally summoned by powerful wizards in search of rare arcane knowledge, the shining children  communicate via telepathy, a psychic roar like metal tearing that sometimes resolves into strained and raspy words. Though they harbor msecrets, their greatest secret may be their own origin.

Ship In A Bottle,2,construct,any,"A model sailing ship in a display bottle the size of a boot sails the air on vaporous waves. Speckles of waters move about the deck like a crew, arming a miniature ballista and preparing to take aim.","A ship in a bottle signifies patience and devotion. Parts are assembled through an obstinate hole to create the illusion of something impossible. The average model maker devotes months of delicate handling and blinding eyestrain to its creation. Most ships in bottles are built by sea captains and modeled after their vessels. As the devotion of a captain to his ship compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the Material Plane. waters sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of waters, see boats as perversions enabling landlubbers' insistence on venturing where they do not belong. These waters spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the waters spirit at the helm claims victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring. A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds. Ecology Model ships in bottles stand prominently on shelves in the quarters of captains and admirals, usually made to perfectly replicate their creators' ships. Once brought to life by a waters spirit, a ship in a bottle maneuvers through the air on waves of mist. The strings of its miniature ballistae winch with enough tension to fire, and the waters spirit turns a tribute into something that is both a weapon and a parody at once. Not all ships in bottles are captained willingly. Captains or admirals who desire more dramatic tributes to the ships they have commanded sometimes have mundane ships in bottles seemingly brought to life via magic. Through either great devotion or greater gold, they gain access to the magic necessary to bind waters spirits to their model ships. The magic binding a waters spirit to a ship in a bottle also enchants the elemental spirit into believing it is the captain and crew of a typical vessel. Magically bound waters spirits follow the orders of either the caster who bound them or the maker of the ship in a bottle, treating him or her as their admiral. Habitat & Society A ship in a bottle's life is on the high seas, and its waters spirit captain sets sail toward the nearest body of waters. Its mission is to seek and destroy land creatures on the seas, and tales of ships in bottles' voyages rarely speak of glory. When a ship in a bottle manages to survive long enough to log journeys, what can be extrapolated from its miniscule logbook makes for fascinating insight into the elemental mind. The ways in which the waters spirit captain justifies the world as seen from its viewpoint reads like a mix of mythology and a child's bathtime story. The spirit inhabiting this construct determines the nature of the crew and replicates tiny sailors on deck. These are solely to unnerve onlookers, as the spirit operates the ship in a bottle's sails and weaponry hydraulically. A waters spirit magically bound to a ship in a bottle agains its will often crews the vessel with manifested sailors based on the bottle's owner, or his descriptions of the original ship's crew. A ship in a bottle sails alone only when it has no other choice, and usually welcomes the opportunity to join, form, or lead a fleet with other waters spirits, flying tiny flags designed seemingly at random. Usually unbound waters spirits captain all the ships in a bottled armada, although sometimes an unbound waters spirit takes advantage of naive bound waters spirits. A chance meeting between individual ships in bottles is not the only manner in which fleets form. waters spirits sometimes conspire to commandeer multiple ships in bottles together, and nautical museums have reported dozens of ships in bottles flying off shelves and out to sea. Construction A ship in a bottle can be created through a binding ritual undertaken by a powerful spellcaster. The ritual requires a masterwork model ship in a bottle that must be built from materials worth 100 gp, and DC 30 Craft  skill checks made over 2 consecutive weeks. Alternatively, a masterwork model ship in a bottle can instead be purchased for the ritual, but it must be worth at least 600 gp.

Ship Sentinel,7,construct,waters,"A larger-than-life wooden carving of a mermaid holding a spear clambers forward, the vibrant paint coating her frame encrusted in years' worth of sea salt.","Ship sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship's captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel's crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics. A ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Ecology A ship sentinel's form is carved and shaped by skilled woodworkers, but cannot truly be brought to ""life"" without offerings from the sea. Most spellcasters who endeavor to create these guardians crush a mixture of sand, shells, and valuable pearls and mix it with saltwaters and oils, creating a grainy varnish. The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain. Although resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries. Habitat & Society Ship sentinels are solitary creations, and a single construct is capable of defending even the largest of ships. Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard-though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets. In combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind-usually a spear, rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawaters and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain. Ship sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their construction also makes them vulnerable to fire-their greatest weakness-and magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile brittleness. Variant Ship Sentinels Ship sentinels can be crafted in a wide variety of forms and are often embellished and customized similarly to mundane figureheads. The following are some of these constructs' most common customizations. Ballista Marksman: Some ship sentinels have a light ballista built into their forms; these sentinels are usually designed to look like an archer with an oversized bow, a beauteous lillend, or a cruel erinyes. Such ship sentinels rarely have a melee weapon, resorting instead to slams if unable to use their ballistae to make ranged attacks. Statistics for ballista marksmen are modified as follows: Ranged light ballista +12 . See Chapter 3 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat for additional details on siege engines. Mariner's Muse: Sculpted to resemble harp-playing angels or armored heralds, a mariner's muse ship sentinel can use the inspire courage effect of a bard's bardic performance once per day for 5 rounds as if it were a 5th-level bard. It always uses all 5 rounds of its performance at the same time and can never use the performance multiple times in 1 day for duration. Sea Sorcerer: These ship sentinels are often crafted to resemble wizards, sea serpents, or abstract orrery-like sculptures, and possess limited spell-like abilities. They can only use these abilities while onboard a sailing vessel. These spell-like abilities can each be used 3 times per day, and include animate objects, grease, and obscuring mist. Construction A ship sentinel is built from 400 pounds of wood. The creator or a hired artisan must then shape the creature into the desired likeness, usually after a fashion common to the nautical vessels of the region. Afterward, a special varnish is made from a mixture of sand, seawaters, crushed pearls and shells, and magically treated oils- the varnish is worth a total of 250 gp and is applied to the entire form. If the creator intends for the ship sentinel to wield a weapon, a masterwork or better version of that weapon must also be supplied.

Its maw is the size of a large wagon, with teeth the size of greatswords.","The legendary shipbreaker is thought to be the largest of the sea serpents, a true behemoth that rules the seas. It is a fearless hunter that enjoys attacking the largest seagoing vessels and crushing them in its mighty coils.

A shipbreaker attacks ships and huge-sized creatures as its primary prey. It ignores smaller creatures except as snacks, or if directly threatened by one. Its favorite tactic is to ambush a ship or approach it at speed, then wrap it in its coils and crush it. It then feasts on the sailors in the waters at its leisure. The shipbreaker is most often sighted deep at sea, usually just before it approaches and breaks up a naval vessel into kindling. It is unknown what language the shipbreaker speaks or understands, if any, since none have ever reported successfully speaking with it.

Shira,12,outsider,any,"Moving with deadly grace, this brutal, thickly furred humanoid figure's head is that of a lioness with dead black eyes.","Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling anthropomorphic lionesses, these divs use their powerful builds, keen senses, and deadly instincts to track the proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes. They embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion with which beast and land might turn against mortals, delighting in proving to civilized beings how small and helpless they are in the face of a savage world. Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping compwith even others of their own kind only long enough to form temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for intelligent prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging not just victims' bodies but also their vital essences. Despite being the most feral of all divs, shiras sometimes serve as scouts and assassins for div hordes. Such arrangements usually prove to be temporary, however, lasting only until the shiras' savage instincts or lust for the hunt again takes hold. Shiras never go after an easy kill, and instead target the most obviously powerful of the possible targets. When acting on this compulsion, a shira weighs its chances for survival and the glory of its intended kill, planning its tactics carefully and not necessarily charging savagely forth. Though savage, a shira is also a cunning hunter and might wait weeks for the perfect opportunity to bring down its chosen prey. Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately 1,200 pounds.",19200
Shoanti Gladiators,2,humanoid,any,This shaven-headed brute wields a massive spiked hammer and bears scars from dozens of battles.,"Easily the most popular public venue in Magnimar, the massive hippodrome known as Serpent's Run hosts a number of spectacles and events year-round to entertain both the citizens of Magnimar and visitors to the city. In addition to magic performances, circus acts, and sporting events, this enormous arena also plays host to the most impressive mock gladiatorial battles in western Varisia.

Shobhad,4,monstrous humanoid,cold deserts or mountains,"This gray-skinned giant is lean and muscled, with four powerful arms bearing weapons. She wears only a decorated leather harness and a loincloth.","The fabled four-armed giants of Akiton are renowned across several worlds for their ferocity in battle. Most Shobhads are born and come of age in one of the fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the ""soft living"" practiced by other humanoid races, seeing in the abandonment of nomadic culture a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or the mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh vie constantly for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor. While considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other Shobhads, and ""lesser"" races are frequently seen as little more than sheep to be culled by the Shobhad wolves. Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Clothing is either practical-such as hide armor and wrappings to protect against biting sandstorms-or ceremonial, with chieftains and shamans wearing brightly colored skins and feathers, yet most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the all-important leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons. While Shobhads are occasionally found alone in the various cities of Akiton, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. In a human city, their shamans preach, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by none. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-not by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a Shobhad is made immortal.",1200
Shocker Lizard,2,magical beast,warm marshes,"This dog-sized lizard has two horns, one on either side of its head, and green scales that crackle with sparks of lightning.","A shocker lizard has a pale yellow underside, with bright green scales elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker lizards tend toward group living, as their electrical abilities grow in power when they are close to another lizard. A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source of waters. Once the colony has settled on a location, the lizards become very territorial and attack anything that intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and hesitant creature-but when several of them gather they become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own size. A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe. Mhave attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company.

When not fighting the abyssal wars among the demon princes, shrroths are often sent to the Material Plane to tempt and corrupt mortals with promises of power and wealth. Those refusing such offers are captured by the shrroth and brought to its Abyssal layer. They are confined in a stone cage and thrown into the Abyssal sea where they sink to the bottom and are never seen again. Shrroths are malevolent creatures and though they follow the orders of their superiors, they are difficult to control.

A mass of long black hair hangs from its head; from under which protrude two forward-curving, blackish horns. Shrroths rarely confront creatures on land; they prefer to fight in the Abyssal waters of their native plane where they have the advantage. These demons open combat using chaos hammer to batter their foes. This is quickly followed by feeblemind against an arcane caster if one is present. If a shrroth grabs an opponent in its tentacles, it hangs on, constricts it and stabs it with its trident. When facing an air-breathing creature, the shrroth likes to cast waters breathing on it, grab it, and swim as deep as it can in the waters before dispelling the waters breathing effect and watching the air-breather drown.

They slay their victims, steal their possessions, and leave their bodies to what ever happens to wander along looking for a meal. Cruel, mean-spirited creatures, silids care nothing for themselves or anything else. They seem to take great pleasure in bringing misery to others, particularly adventurers. Silids rarely interact with other races. They are an untrustworthy lot, and most other races avoid contact with them. Silids live in groups  of up to 40 individuals. Each stripe is a loose organization of silids, with a single leader that controls and governs the remainder of the stripe. The leader is almost always the meanest, cruelest, and sneakiest silid of the bunch. Under his command, the silids conduct raids and hunt their subterranean realm for surfacedwellers that have wandered into their territory. When hunting or harassing travelers, silids often don armor  and carry weapons. Silids skulk about their underground world in search of surfacedwellers. Surface-dwellers seem to love exploring the Underdark, so there rarely is a shortage of opponents for the mean-spirited silid. Often, a band of silids trails an adventuring party before attacking; waiting until the terrain is just right . When the attack commences, a silid blurs itself and usually employs one of the following tactics. The silids attack from ambush, attempting to maim or kill as mof their opponents as they can.

Siren,5,magical beast,temperate or warm hills,"This creature has the body of a hawk and the head of a beautiful woman with long, shining hair.","These bizarre beings have the bodies of hawks, owls, or eagles, but the heads of beautiful human women. Their faces typically ref lect the human ethnicity dominant in the area in which they lair, and they almost always bear a vibrant and youthful countenance. All sirens are female and long-lived. The oldest known sirens haunt their territories for nearly a millennium, although most only live for a few hundred years. Sirens require male humanoids to mate, and several times per decade either capture or rescue bold or comely sailors who enter their territories. Stories abound of sirens dying- either through heartache or suicide-when sailors they attempted to lure overcame their compelling powers and escaped their grasps. Sirens always live near the sea, where their powerful voices can carry over the waves and attract the attention of unwary sailors who trespass near their isles.

Siyokoy,10,aberration,oceans,"This eel-like creature sports sharp frills that run along the back of humanoid torso and down its long, powerful tail.","Siyokoys are eel-like waters creatures often mistaken for merfolk by sailors. On closer inspection, however, siyokoys' appearance might make one question the vision of said sailors, for apart from their humanoid arms, siyokoys are very much creatures of the sea. Two primary species of siyokoys exist, although both are essentially identical as far as game statistics are concerned. The most commonly encountered siyokoys are those that dwell amid the caves and crags of coral reefs in relatively shallow oceansic waters. These siyokoys tend to have colorful patterns on their flesh to mimic the riot of hues the typical coral reef displays. Reef-dwelling siyokoys are fond of decorating their lairs with particularly strange or colorful specimens of coral, especially when such marine growths encrust sunken treasures. A siyokoy variant that is encountered less frequently dwells in the deeper abysses of the oceans, far below the limits of the sun's ability to light. These siyokoys are darker colored, and they tend to be darker in personality as well. Whereas those dwelling in the bright, sunlit environs of a coral reef might be capricious or playful, those who dwell in the dark, vast deeps of the sea are often morbid, morose, and even sadistic. Most evil siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the world's oceans. Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and flooded cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the creatures share about these areas-it is not lucky, say siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures have drowned. A siyokoy is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.",9600

Skin Stealer,2,fey,any,"Dark pink flesh drawn tightly across its emaciated body, this being resembles a gaunt human stripped of its skin, its pulsing muscles completely exposed.","A sadistic being from the realm of the fey, a skin stealer is a terrifying sight to behold. These blood-red creatures resemble horrid, emaciated humans without skin, their yellowish eyes and teeth suggesting malnourishment or disease. Skin stealers suffer from no ailment, however, except for their insatiable lust for chaos and their hunger for flesh. Hailing from the First World, skin stealers are fey bent on destruction and gruesome murder. When left to their own devices, these gangly beings are unpredictable and spontaneous; when assigned duties from some higher, stronger power, however, skin stealers prove adept at performing complex assassinations and spy work. A skin stealer is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds, though it can adjust its size to inhabit mdifferent creatures' skins. Ecology Nightmares can come true just as readily as dreams in the First World, and the skin stealer is proof of this. A manifestation of inhabitants' fears and disdain, a skin stealer's primary desires are to deceive, murder, and rob. In a world where inconsistency is the law and little can be trusted anyway, these evil denizens only add to the overwhelming sense of paranoia mtravelers feel when thrust into the magical realm of the fey. When a powerful inhabitant of the Material Plane experiences intense feelings of distrust and maliciousness, she can unintentionally draw out a skin stealer from the First World-often whilst sleeping-under the guise of a nightmare. Thus, an unwitting evoker of such a dark being awakens cold and sweaty, unaware of the chaotic fey now causing mayhem outside her chamber walls-assuming the bandit hasn't already made off with her flesh yet. Skin stealers possess few items of their own, as they derive absolutely no pleasure from material goods, and often times the only thing one will carry is a sharp object. Though their claws-thick and unsightly as they are- are formidable weapons, they are not ideal tools when it comes to flaying victims. Thus, mskin stealers use rusty knives or crude blades as their scalpels. Most skin stealers would revel in the agony that skinning victims alive would cause, but the simple fact of the matter is that stripping a subject's flesh is too difficult while the victim is still alive. It is out of convenience, rather than sense of mercy, that a skin stealer slays a target before performing its barbaric reinterpretation of surgery. Though most think of skin stealers as nothing more than mindless killing machines with a quirky habit of peeling the skin off victims, the truth is grimmer. In addition to their affinity for grisly murders, skin stealers also possess a love of trickery, delighting in the chaos they can create through impersonating political leaders they have slain or the havoc they can wreak while wearing the flesh of a trusted guard or advisor. Where a skin stealer goes, there is not only death, but confusion as well. The techniques skin stealers employ while preparing a hide for use would inspire the envy and admiration of fur trappers if the act were not so heinous. Even more remarkable than their style of flaying, perhaps, is their supernatural ability to preserve the flesh of victims for lengthy periods of time. Skin stealers fold the fleshy suit of a victim into an impressively compact pouch that they can fit into fist-sized pocket or pouch. Realizing the benefits of possessing multiple hides, skin stealers tend to wear clothes with numerous compartments, making adventurers and traveling merchants particularly susceptible to having their skins and outfits stolen. Skin stealers' own flesh looks similar to the muscular layer beneath most humanoids' epidermis. This outer layer is so taut that it allows skin to perfectly adhere to it. The malleable vocal cords of a skin stealer are located on the outside of its throat-when it dons the flesh of another being, it captures that creature's voice's tone and inf lection by shaping its own neck muscles so as to fit its host's perfectly. The slightest bump or agitation may disturb the sensitive vocal lining, however, and one of the most common giveaways of a skin stealer in disguise is an abrupt crack in its speech or a shift in register. A skin stealer does not die of old age; instead, it continually wanders whatever plane it may have found itself upon until it is slain, at which time it returns to the First World to be reborn into the cosmic energy comprising its native realm. Habitat & Society Often used by powerful entities of the First World as spies, assassins, and agents of havoc, skin stealers excel at espionage as well as cold-blooded murder. On the Material Plane, skin stealers are much more difficult to partner with, their lust for flesh only heightened by the plethoric array of new available suits. However, if one can garner the respect of a skin stealer , one has found a powerful ally. When a skin stealer emerges from the First World onto the Material Plane, it immediately tries to find a host for its horrid form, knowing full well that exposure could lead to its swift eradication. Fortunately for the wretched fey, it usually arrives via the unhindered emotions of a hapless dreamer rapt in torturous visions or night terrors. This helpless subject makes for an easy first target, and a skin stealer may inhabit this individual's flesh for several days while it gathers its bearings and studies the immediate world around it. Skin stealers rarely stay in one spot long, however. Their love of mayhem often turns a place of peace into one of bedlam, and it behooves a skin stealer to continue alternating between different suits of skin, both to perpetuate chaos and to mask its identity. When people begin to suspect the gruesome bandit or catch it in its gory work, it hastily leaves the area in search of new, unsuspecting victims. Skin stealers do not collaborate or work together unless a higher power forces them to do so. Their self ish predispositions and individualistic tactics make teamwork diff icult, and planned assassinations tend to go better when performed by a lone skin stealer. Just as useful, though, are skin stealers who remain at their master's side, so adept are they at identifying doppelgangers and other skin stealers. As skin stealers are masters of disguise as well as flaying, few can bypass their perceptive gaze.",600
Skin Stitcher,5,aberration,land or underground,This gaunt skeletal humanoid has heavily scarred flesh randomly stitched together. Its eyes are sunken and burn with hatred.,"A skin stitcher is a malevolent and violent creature that kills for food, pleasure, and the skin of humanoids . While it is known to eat just about anything it kills, it only keeps the skin and flesh of humanoid creatures. Other creatures are devoured, flesh and all. Skin stitchers collect the flesh and skin of humanoid creature slain. From this, they weave intricate clothes and coverings that they wear over their entire body. At a distance, the skin stitcher can pass for a normal humanoid when wearing one of these ""skin suits"" . Up close, the skin stitcher's disguise becomes much less effective, making it appear as a humanoid with a heavily scarred and stitched together body. The skin stitcher stands about 6 feet tall and  appears as a skinless humanoid. Its natural body appears to be bone wrapped tightly with corded muscle and covered with a dark red-purplish slime. Its eye sockets are deep and contain large bulbous eyes with blue irises. The skin stitcher's long, lanky arms end in claws as do its thick, muscled legs. It carries two large chains covered with msharpened barbs. Though their hands are clawed, skin stitchers prefer to attack using large chains covered with razor-sharp barbs. These not only aid in killing a foe, but also help strip the flesh from a victim. Skin stitchers often attack from ambush, attempting to gain the upper hand over their prey as quickly as possible. Slain opponents are skinned and then eaten or carried to the skin stitcher's lair and devoured later. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600
Skitterdark Demon,3,outsider,any,"A small humanoid-shaped creature no more than 1-foot tall flutters nearby, held aloft by its crimson leathery bat wings. Its body is blood red and somewhat stocky for its size. Its hands end in sharp claws and its eyes and teeth are sickly yellow.","Skitterdarks are tiny demons that relish in the destruction of others, especially good-aligned outsiders . Not normally found in large numbers within the rank-and-file of demonic armies, some lords do employ these creatures as watch patrols around their palaces or along their borders. What these creatures lack in size and strength, they make up for in ferocity and determination. Skitterdarks roam their home planes harassing other demons and creatures not native to their Abyssal planes. They have a fondness for the flesh of mortals, particularly goblins and halflings, often capturing the latter and cooking it over a slow-burning fire using an iron spit. Some skitterdarks wear the flayed skin of goblins and halflings as trophies, weaving arm bands, bracelets, or necklaces from the dried out flesh. Skitterdarks stand 1 foot tall and weigh about 15 pounds. Its wings are crimson, its body red, and its claws blackened and usually filthy. Skitterdarks are aggressive demons that attack using their tiny sickles or claws and bite. They rarely touch the ground during combat, preferring to attack from the air. Against good-aligned creatures they always forego weapons so they can use their profane claws. When encountered in great numbers, skitterdarks form clusters and swarm over their opponents, raking with their claws or slashing with their tiny weapons. Some skitterdarks carry poisons extracted from various abyssal plants in order to coat their weapons. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",25600
Skrik Nettle,6,magical beast,tropical,"A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird's feathers around its quivering central mass and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in a snapping beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different note in an eerie harmony.","Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin. Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across  to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across. Ecology Skrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first-and then begins to float off the ground. As long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle's victim, the victim keeps floating up into the skies. The victim has no control over this magical levitation-unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead. The poison's effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle's poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison. Once every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal's spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground-usually a junglesclearing or warm swamps-and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor . The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant's skull. These eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the skies, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the skies by a particularly large hatchling. Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the skies and explodes upon hatching, the cloth's contents scatter across the skies like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties-though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting. Habitat & Society Skrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal. Skrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators- thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle's spawning grounds are involved-during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion. Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather. Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, ""docking"" them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of ""docked"" skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak-the skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself, with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice.",2400
Skulk,1,humanoid,any,"This lithe, gray-skinned humanoid is completely hairless. It has soft, almost childlike facial features.","Skulks are a race of humanoids that dwell on the fringe of other societies. They are a parasitic race-the humanoid equivalent of rats that survive by theft, subterfuge, and at times outright murder. Skulks are consummate cowards, sneaking into humanoid communities under cover of darkness and taking what they desire. Skulks never initiate combat unless there is no other option. They prefer to strike from ambush, a tactic aided by their chameleon-like ability to change their skin tone. Skulks are cowardly opponents, attempting to flee as soon as they are injured or the odds are against them. Skulks are approximately human-sized, but are very lightly built. They have slender, graceful arms and legs. Skulks have no hair, and their eyes are usually pale blue or pink. The grayish skin of a skulk is leathery to the touch, but the skulk has the natural ability to vary its skin tone to match nearly environment. A typical skulk stands 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds. Skulk Society Skulks dwell in small bands or family groups, living a nomadic existence as they travel from place to place. They move constantly so as not to attract undue attention from local militias. A skulk lair will usually be located in an area that is easily concealed, such as a cave or forests. Occasionally, skulks will sneak into a large city's sewer system and set up a more or less permanent presence there, moving their lair from place to place under the city. Skulks remain hidden during daylight hours, leaving the safety of their lair to conduct forays into the humanoid community under cover of darkness. A favored tactic of a skulk band is to sneak into a residence under cover of darkness and slaughter the entire family. Once that grisly task is complete, the skulks remain to take what they will from the home and leave the following dawn.

Skull Spider,0.25,vermin,any,This tiny creature appears to be a humanoid skull with eight spidery legs.,"Skull spiders are tarantula-like creatures that reside in the skulls of their victims. The two front legs of a skull spider contain poisoned barbs that they use to sting their victims. The weak and fleshy body of a skull spider is about the size of a grapefruit and is easily damaged. Its eyes grow on the end of long, slender stalks. Skull spiders take up residence within skulls as a means of protecting themselves in a manner similar to hermit crabs. Their eyestalks protrude through the empty eye sockets of their skull, and their legs have a backwards curve in the first joint that enables them to extend out of the bottom of the skull to allow rapid locomotion. Skull spiders can also fold their legs under their skull so they cannot be seen. Man adventurer has been unnerved by the sight of dozens of skulls seemingly sprouting long, spidery legs and skittering toward them. A colony of skull spiders is led by a king and queen, which are the only two members of the colony that are capable of reproducing. After a victim is subdued, the queen deposits an egg in the skull. Queen skull spiders are always 3 HD. The larva hatches, consumes the brain over a period of weeks, and then enters a pupae stage.

Skull Swarm,1,undead,any,"This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.","Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature. The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also be created, though for the purposes of how mcan be created, they are treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability. Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although type of magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar, necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess. These traits can be mixed and matched in way and applied to of the beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the listed amount. Belching : A belching beheaded gains the ability to spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does 1d6 damage of a specific type  chosen at the time of the beheaded's animation. Burning : This beheaded is similar to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning skull gains the burn  special ability when using its slam attack, where the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing : This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its slam attack, and can attempt to grapple creature of Medium size or smaller in this way Screaming : Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chillsing scream. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming skull's Cha modifier.

Skum,2,monstrous humanoid,temperate or cold waters or underground,"This hunchbacked, green-skinned humanoid has a wide, frog-like head but a mouth more akin to that of a toothy fish.","Skum are the most prolific and successful of the countless races created by the aboleths to serve as slaves. At the height of the aboleth empire, skum were legion and their armies waged mwars upon the land, yet now that the aboleths are in decline, skum have been set loose to manage on their own. For the most part, the skum have been less than successful at this endeavor, and today they exist in a shadow of their previous multitude, most of them dwelling deep underground in slowly crumbling ruins left standing only because their enemies have lost interest in pursuing the now-won war against these fish-like humanoids. Skum have even lost their own name-only the most erudite and wise of their kind remember that they were once known as the ulat-kini. Today, most identify themselves with the racial epithet applied to them by surface-dwellers-""skum."" Skum do not age, and barring death by violence or disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable of reproducing among themselves, for all skum are male. The aboleths did not want their slave race to prosper without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from human stock, skum can impregnate humans, and the children issued from such unholy unions are invariably deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual transformations throughout their lives, and when they would normally die of old age, such hybrids instead go through ""the change,"" shedding their wrinkled flesh and transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would prefer to languish in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes settling offshore of remotely populated coastlines seem to be on the rise. Some such communities raid villages for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form alliances with these desperate folk, providing protection and bounty from the sea in return for wives.",600

Skvader,0.5,magical beast,temperate forests or hills,"This small creature has the forequarters and hind legs of a hare, and the wings and tail of a wood grouse.","A combination of hare and grouse, skiesvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered. A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds. Ecology Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in hillsier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance. They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed. Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skiesvaders move on to nearby farms and continue feeding. If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to that target. Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one, undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear. Habitat & Society To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skiesvaders often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size, particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack. In skvader families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows, patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to new feeding grounds. Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the compof their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.",200

Slag Worm,20,outsider,any,This massive wormlike creature of burnt iron and glistening hematite grinds with the roar of the forge. Its fanged lamprey like mouth opens to reveal the molten fires burning in its gut.,"Slag worms burrow endlessly through the elemental Plane of Earth, Elemental Plane of Fire, and Plane of Molten Skies, occasionally forcing through weak points into the material planes where they burrow deep beneath the earth, devouring raw iron deposits to keep their internal furnaces burning. Because of this they have been known to devour entire companies of heavily armored dwarves and orcs, mistaking their gear for a new vein of naturally occurring iron salts. Slag worms average about 40 feet long and weigh about 60,000 pounds, though specimens as large as 100 feet or more have been rumored to exist. Its massive form radiates abysmal heat and when the worm opens its maw, fires can be seen burning and raging in its interior. They are intelligent creatures  and can speak though they rarely choose to converse with other races. A slag worm erupts from the ground seeking to eat anything wearing iron, steel, or other metal armor or equipment. It attacks such creatures with a great ferocity, generally disregarding other enemies until the worm is heavily injured or forced away by magic. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",307200
Slaughterford,8,monstrous humanoid,underground,"A wiry figure approaches, its hairless body inhumanly slender and frail looking. It has two sets of arms, a smaller pair of stunted normal looking arms and a longer primary set knotted with wiry muscle with malformed forearms ending in long cartilaginous blades.","Sometimes known as reaperborn, slaughterfords were bred from unknown humanoid stock by long-forgotten wizards in ages past. They typically dwell underground in burrows or caves and only venture to the surface world at night. They are not harmed by sunlight, but do not like it. Slaughterfords move with an odd grace, capable of inhuman feats of agility and flexibility. Their faces are twisted mockeries of human expression, bearing reddish eyes, large noses, and perpetual sneers of evil and rage. Their secondary arms are much weaker and are only used for simple manipulation, never for combat. When the slaughterford is engaged in combat, it keeps its secondary arms folded against its belly. A slaughterford strikes with its arm blades. In melee it relentlessly slashes and stabs until either it or its opponent is dead. It can use both of its arm blades with equal proficiency. Heavily armored opponents are subjected to its armor rending ability before being slashed and stabbed. A slaughterford gang works in concert to slay their foes, though when faced with overwhelming odds, slaughterfords attempt to flee. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
Sleeping Willow,10,plant,temperate forests,"Before you stands a low willow tree with a wide trunk, its bent branches sway solemnly in the breeze.","Sleeping willows are slow-moving, carnivorous plant creatures with evil dispositions. Most sleeping willows make their home among groves or areas of normal willow trees where they can use their natural appearance to their advantage. Though capable of movement, the sleeping willow only moves at night, so as not to be detected or seen. Once a hunting area becomes depopulated or scarce, the sleeping willow moves on to better hunting grounds where it takes root and repeats the above cycle of waiting, hunting, and moving on to a new location. Sleeping willows do not collect treasure but the treasure from their past victims is often scattered about the base of the tree. Sleeping willows do not mind this, for they know that greedy treasure-seekers will be lured in by this and it makes catching a meal that much easier. A sleeping willow appears as a normal willow tree  standing 15 or more feet tall. Some species have been rumored to reach heights in excess of 30 feet. Its trunk is 2 feet or more in diameter and dark brown in color. From the trunk sprout branches that end in long drooping and graceful twigs. The sleeping willow is crowned with leaves of green or brownish-green. A sleeping willow prefers to attack from ambush when potential prey wanders too close to it. Once prey is in range, the sleeping willow releases its spores and then attacks with its branches, grabbing its prey in its viselike grip. Grappled creatures are drained of their body fluids and absorbed by the tree. A grove of sleeping willows act in concert against multiple opponents, aiding one another when necessary until the opponents are slain or flee. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",9600
Sleipnir,11,magical beast,cold mountains,This mighty horse has eight powerful legs. Its hooves leave shimmering hoofprints that quickly fade to mist.,"Sleipnirs are a legendary breed of magical, eight-legged horses. Most sleipnirs have jet-black coats and long, flowing manes and tails, though occasionally a sleipnir foal is born with a white or shimmering silver coat. Such rare sleipnirs sometimes display additional abilities beyond those of their darker kin. A typical sleipnir stands 6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder, measures about 12 feet long, and weighs upward of 1,600 pounds. Believed to be descended from the mystical steeds of gods, sleipnirs have spread throughout the Material Plane. While sleipnirs cannot actually fly, they are able to walk on air as easily as on land, and spend much of their time galloping across the skies of their homes. Although sleipnirs lack the ability to travel between planes themselves, riders have brought them as mounts far beyond the Material Plane, and populations of sleipnirs can be found on several of the more hospitable Outer Planes as well. Sleipnirs are highly prized as steeds, but as intelligent magical beasts, they cannot be trained using the Handle Animal skill, and those trying to do so find them intractable and even violent. Although they cannot speak, sleipnirs understand Auran, and one seeking a sleipnir as a mount must convince the creature to serve using Diplomacy, Intimidate, or other means. Sleipnirs are generally indifferent to most creatures, meaning they can be found serving as steeds to creatures of all alignments, from good to evil. Riding a sleipnir requires no equipment other than a normal saddle, and they are well trained in combat from birth. A rider does not need to make a Ride check to control a sleipnir in battle, but must make a Ride check to attack in the same round that the sleipnir attacks. A sleipnir can carry 519 pounds as a light load, 1,038 pounds as a medium load, and 1,560 pounds as a heavy load.",12800

Slime Mold,3,ooze,temperate forests,A large but colorful grove of small mushrooms and other tiny plants sprout upon a wide swath of moss.,"Slime molds are found in forests, swamps, and underground; place natural fungi and mold grows. A slime mold lies dormant among the growths soaking nutrients from them, and waiting for living creatures to wander too close to it. Slime molds are often mistaken for plant creatures because their forms are completely covered with molds, fungi, and in particular mushrooms of varying hues, shapes, and sizes. This gives the monster the appearance of an undulating mass of plant matter when actuality they are a rare form of non-acidic ooze. Something in the creature's protoplasmic substance causes mushrooms, molds, mosses, and other fungal plants to take root and grow on its surface in a symbiotic relationship. A slime mold attacks from surprise anytime it detects a living creature within 10 feet of it. It lashes out with a pseudopod and then attempts to wrap its body around the victim. The slime mold relies on its natural ability to appear as a patch of mushrooms to foil potential prey. Slime molds inflict an opponent with fungal rot if they hit with a slam attack. Fungal rot causes a darkening of the skin and small patches of fungus and mold to sprout at random locations on the victim's body. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800

Slithering Tracker,4,ooze,ruins or underground,"A long, moist streak along the dark stone suddenly undulates like a serpent and then rises up to attack.","An alien inhabitant of the dark underworld, the slithering tracker is a glistening creature of transparent ooze, typically about 3 inches thick and at least 3 feet in diameter. When still, it looks like a wet patch of stone or a patch of condensation on a wall. Comparatively slow moving, the slithering tracker relies on its transparency and knack for ambushing to surprise prey. Once a slithering tracker has paralyzed a living creature, it flows over an exposed patch of flesh, grabbing on and draining blood from the victim. A slithering tracker can drain a human-sized creature of its blood with shocking swiftness, leaving only a desiccated carcass behind. A slithering tracker can go some time between meals, but never turns down easy prey. The larger a slithering tracker grows, the more voracious its appetite becomes, until, after a particularly large feeding, the creature splits into two smaller slithering trackers that eventually go their separate ways in search of feeding territory. Slithering trackers are not harmed by bright light, but still prefer to avoid areas of intense illumination or natural sunlight, and so only venture aboveground at night. They prefer the cool, damp environment of their native caves and tunnels. Although intelligent and cunning, slithering trackers are entirely alien creatures. They do not possess language of their own, although they can usually understand the dominant language of the region they dwell in-usually Undercommon. Some underworld inhabitants do manage to forge alliances with slithering trackers, or at least exist with them in symbiosis by providing the creatures with easy and regular prey, but as one can never truly know a slithering tracker's desires or motivations, such alliances are dangerous to rely upon.",1200
Slorath,18,magical beast,cold hills or mountains,"Slithering from the snow emerges a 40-foot long serpent with glossy-white scales and a bluish-white underbelly, its long, slender, icy-blue tongue flickering. Its vertical-slit pupils glow an otherworldly greenish-blue and rows of sharpened teeth line tremendous mouth.","The great sloraths are found only in the coldest and most desolate regions, though close enough to civilization to hunt and stage raids against humanoid settlements when the slorath goes hunting. Highly intelligent and aware, the slorath is a fierce predator that defends its hunting ground with precision tactics and power. Small villages within a slorath's territory sometimes strike deals with these creatures; offering sacrifices in return for the protection the slorath can offer. Slorath are generally nocturnal carnivores. They exist on a diet of white dragons, polar bears, frost men , and barbegazi . They are particularly fond of white dragon meat and often go out of their way to hunt for such creatures. Frost giants often strike deals with frost giants so it is not uncommon for the two to be encountered together working toward a common goal. Slorath lairs are either enormous tunnels deep under the ice and snow or abandoned white dragon lairs. Encounters are almost always with a solitary creature. In rare instances young sloraths or eggs might be found in a lair. Young slorath resemble their parent in all respects. Slorath eggs are stark white in color. A slorath usually begins an encounter by hiding under the snow waiting for prey to wander by, or by lying unmoving on the snow itself where its coloration offers it camouflage against the white background. When prey comes within range, the slorath assaults it with its paralyzing gaze. Helpless creatures are then attacked with its powerful bite. Those that attempt to avoid its gaze witness the slorath project its gaze as a ray of blue energy . Continued aggression against a slorath results in it unleashing a cone of cold or ice storm on its foes. If faced with particularly powerful foes, it uses its ice storm and glacial storm special abilities. A slorath does not fight to the death and flees if combat goes against it. Note however, if young slorath are present and they are threatened, a slorath fights to the death. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",153600
Sloth Viper,3,magical beast,temperate or warm forests or marshes,This large emerald snake has bands of gold and black ringing its body and a black-tipped tail.,"The sloth viper is a lightning-quick predator most often found in dense, thick jungles or overgrown swampslands. The typical sloth viper is 9-10 feet long, though they can grow to a length of 20 or more feet. They subsist on a diet of small animals, preferring birds, lizards, and small mammals to others. They are fearless however, and do not hesitate to attack much larger prey such as cheetahs, leopards, and even lions. Once the sloth viper has fed, it often recoils high above the ground, under the thicket and blanket of leaves, branches, and limbs where it sleeps for the next 1d6 days. The sloth viper is a solitary predator; rarely is more than one encountered. If such an encounter takes place, they are often a mated pair, with a nest of eggs nearby. A sloth viper's lair is a dense thicket of natural underbrush and trees. A typical nest contains 1d4 emerald colored eggs. Sloth vipers are hunted by some humanoids for their scales and poison . Sloth vipers are ambush hunters and wait patiently among the limbs and branches of trees for potential prey to pass underneath it. When unsuspecting prey is in range, the viper either drops on it from above, or snaps down quickly with its vicious bite, recoiling back into the trees afterwards.

Slurk,2,magical beast,temperate swamps or underground,"This disgusting beast looks like a slime-covered toad, but with two walrus-like tusks jutting from its upper jaw.","Slurks are frog-like creatures, the descendants of the failed result of a dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Though the dwarves failed to create suitable livestock, the sticky frogbeasts are often befriended by other underground races. Slurks are carnivores and have a formidable bite, thanks to their massive tusks. Their true strength, however, lies in their foul-smelling and unnatural secretions. The mucus exuded from the slurk's back is incredibly sticky and quickly hardens into a powerful resin, a quality the creature turns to its advantage by squirting it at intruders and then waiting for it to harden before closing for the kill. At the same time, the liquid excreted by glands on a slurk's stomach is incredible slippery, allowing the slurk to keep from being immobilized by its own back slime and also making it extremely hard to grapple or maneuver without its consent. Combined with slurks' natural ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings with ease, these abilities make the foul-smelling creatures extremely desirable to kobolds, who domesticate and train the frogbeasts as powerful mounts and guardians.",600

It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by mto be one of the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elementalbased planes. Acid quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place, are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable.

Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the ground.

The elemental's home plane is a flat, rocky place with little life, no known waters sources, and no plant life or foliage. The plane is always shrouded in darkness. Dense pockets of intense gravity and areas of little or no gravity dot the barren landscape. Gravity elementals seem to be able to converse with others of their kind by manipulating gravity itself. Gravity elementals attack primarily by flailing at their opponents with multiple arms, each one a mixture of fluctuating fields of micro-gravity and debris that has been sucked into its gravity well.

Small Monstrous Sea Wasp,0.5,vermin,warm waters,"A translucent blue and nearly invisible in waters, this cube-shaped jellyfish has four distinct sides and trails dozens of extremely long tentacles.","Monstrous sea wasps are deadly waters creatures with long, writhing and highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm waters and tend to congregate near coastlines regions or rivers mouths where they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience. A creature stung by a sea wasp that lives to tell about, never forgets its brush with this monstrosity. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.",200

Small Stingray,0.5,animal,warm waters,"A wide, sail-like creature glides through the waters dragging a barbed, whip-like tail behind it.","Stingrays are bottom feeders and are found in warm, shallow waters near coastlines and shores. They sustain themselves on a diet of plankton, waters plants, small crabs, and small fish. Larger stingrays, like smaller rays, are found in shallow, warm waters, though these creatures often swim into much deeper waters. Giant stingrays feed on creatures such as fish, giant crabs, octopus, and sharks. They are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts and often engage prey larger than themselves, relying on their poison to bring down a foe. Female stingrays are usually larger than males. Young stingrays resemble adult rays, but are much smaller in size. During birth, the young's pectoral fins are folded against its body but open as soon as it is born. Stingrays are completely flat with no discernible head. At one end is a long, whip-like tail that ends in a razor-sharp and serrated barb. Their eyes appear as small bumps on the end opposite the tail and their mouth is located on the underside of their body. The sides of a stingray are composed of large, wide pectoral fins . Stingrays are brown, black, or slate gray and their underbelly is white. Small stingrays are about three feet across, while the largest ray measures 12 feet across. Small stingrays are generally inoffensive creatures. Most ""attacks"" occur in shallow waters when a creature steps on a buried ray. If stepped on, the stingray lashes out with its stinger. If threatened by an opponent much larger than it, the stingray attempts to sting its opponent and then flees. Larger stingrays are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts, and some are very active when searching for prey. They are nocturnal hunters and attack using a tail sting or wing buffet.

Smilodon,5,animal,warm forests or plains,"This great cat is a terrifying apparition of power and violence, muscles rippling beneath its short fur and vicious saber-like teeth extending downward from its upper jaw.","The smilodon, also known as the saber-toothed cat, is a powerful feline predator that savors the flesh of large creatures such as mastodons, mammoths, elephants, bison, buffalo, deer, and other great cats . Smilodons are noted scavengers and have no problem devouring another animal's kill. Animals that resist the smilodon usually become part of the meal as well. Often mistakenly referred to as sabertoothed tigers by adventurers and sages, they are not in fact, related to tigers at all. Breeding season for smilodons takes place year round . A male smilodon mates with all females in the den. Gestation lasts about 80 days after which time 1d4+2 cubs are born. Cubs reach maturity around two years of age. Most leave the den and go on their own at this age. Smilodons average about five feet long and weigh nearly 500 pounds, but can grow to a length of eight feet and weigh up to 900 pounds. Their fur is golden or spotted . Their legs are short but powerful and their tail is short and bobbed. The smilodon has two eight-inch long, downward-curving canine teeth. These saber-like fangs are very sharp and are used for stabbing prey. This creature can open its jaws almost twice as far as other big cats. Other great cats, like lions and tigers, can only open their jaws to an angle of about 65-degrees, but the smilodon can stretch its jaws to an angle of 120-degrees. These ferocious hunters prefer to attack from ambush, using their coloration to blend in with their surroundings so they can catch their opponents by surprise. When prey is spotted, the smilodon waits for it to come close, and then leaps to attack. When combating a foe, the sabertooth bites and rakes with its claws. It uses its long canine teeth to stab its prey, aiming for the fleshier and softer parts of its victim's body  where it inflicts terrible wounds with its saber-like teeth.

Smoke Dragon,2,dragon,temperate forests or marshes,"This creature is a small, 3-foot long, dragon with a grayish underbelly and black scales. Its feet are tipped with smoke-gray talons and it has red-tinged wings and blue-gray eyes. Small under-curved horns protrude from its head and its serpentine tail writhes like a plume of smoke.","Smoke dragons lair in marshes, dense forests, or just about area where thick fog is present . They venture from their lair when the fog is the thickest, so most encounters occur in the morning. Lairs take the form of natural caves or caverns and are usually near a natural source of waters. They eat just about anything but prefer a diet of fruits, plants, and berries. They also eat small animals such as mice and other rodents found slinking about near their lair. A smoke dragon's feeding grounds is generally small and most cover an area of less than 1 square mile. Smoke dragons live in small groups and such a group always includes at least one mated pair. Hatchlings can assume smoke form for 1 minute per day but cannot fly. If eggs are present, the female guards them closely and will fight to the death protecting them. Eggs are round, mottled gray and black. Smoke dragons are generally inoffensive creatures and keep to themselves. Only when threatened or if their lair is threatened do they attack. In such cases, a smoke dragon unleashes its breath weapon and then swoops in to attack with its claws and bite. If the smoke dragon is outnumbered or overwhelmed, it uses its smoke form to avoid its opponents and flee. Multiple smoke dragons gang up against foes, alternating their breath weapon and natural attacks with the other smoke dragons in the gang; i.e., one smoke dragon belches forth its breath weapon while the others swoop in and attack with their claws and bite.

They are generally lazy, but quick to anger. When encountered on the material planes it is usually because they have been summoned or called by a spellcaster to perform some task or chore. On such planes, smoke mephits generally prefer warmer climates and are never found in cold areas . Smoke mephits enjoy combat and rush headlong into it, slashing with their claws. If a smoke mephit can draw its opponents to within 20 feet of its position, it uses its spell-like abilities to create an ember storm.

Snallygaster,3,aberration,temperate forests or mountains,"With a terrible screech, the lean, scaly beast swoops down from the skies on great dark wings. A single eye stares out from its cruel face, and tentacles writhe within its sharp, toothy beak.","Strange things lurk in the wild places of the world, hiding in remote forests or isolated mountains, away from prying eyes. The snallygaster, a hideous amalgamation of lizard and bird that preys on unwary travelers, is one such creature. Black stripes run the length of its scaly green hide all the way to the tip of its long, sinuous tail. Muscular, membranous wings sprout from the creature's back, bearing it through the skies at tremendous speed. Its claws and beak have an almost metallic sheen to them, hinting at their sharpness and strength. The snallygaster's serpentine neck terminates at a small, birdlike head with a single eye set in the center of the forehead. In place of a tongue, its long throat contains a slobbering mass of tentacles that twist and squirm grotesquely whenever the creature extends them. A typical snallygaster measures 9 feet long from the tip of its tail to the point of its beak. Its wingspan measures over 15 feet, and it weighs approximately 200 pounds. Ecology The snallygaster, mainly carnivorous, subsists primarily on deer, sheep, or similar animals, although it prefers to hunt sentient creatures when given the chance. The snallygaster is an ambush predator, attacking its prey from above. Once it spots a potential victim, it soars high into the air before diving sharply down toward its unsuspecting foe, using the fall to build up momentum. At the end of the dive, the snallygaster impales its prey with its 2-foot-long serrated beak, plunging the razor-sharp bill straight into its victim's chest. The snallygaster's thick skull and muscular neck allow it to withstand the sudden impact unharmed, while its target usually suffers several broken bones and internal hemorrhaging. If its victim is stout or lucky enough to survive the initial attack, the snallygaster employs the vicious claws on its forelegs to inf lict savage wounds upon its foe. Once its foe lies dead or unconscious, the snallygaster uses its tonguelike tentacles to slurp up the victim's blood. Some experts theorize the snallygaster thirsts for blood because of its iron content, which might help maintain the semimetallic composition of the beast's beak and claws. Others claim the snallygaster's tentacle-f illed throat makes swallowing solid food diff icult, an idea supported by the creature's tendency to leave its kills out to rot for several days before consuming them. The truth may be that the snallygaster enjoys drinking the blood of its enemies, deriving a sort of ritualistic satisfaction from gulping down the still-warm life essence of its prey. If the snallygaster feels that it or its kill is being threatened, it uses its surprisingly powerful tentacles to latch on to the body and carry it deep into the forests where it can exsanguinate the corpse in peace. The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is alcohol. Scholars still debate whether this is an instinctive dependency, or whether a snallygaster acquires the addiction later in life. What is known is that snallygasters spend much of each fall scouring their territories for fermenting fruit, which they gorge themselves on until thoroughly inebriated. Snallygasters grow extremely aggressive when intoxicated. When drunk they rampage across the countryside in a violent stupor, slaughtering anyone and anything that crosses their paths. Snallygasters that range into lands populated by humanoids quickly develop a taste for man-made liquor, especially distilled spirits. Such drinks are far more potent than the snallygaster's natural sources of alcohol, and regularly imbibing them can greatly exacerbate the snallygaster's addiction. Even the most cautious of snallygasters can go mad with desire once it catches the scent of drink. It charges into town, heedless of danger, and smashes its way into a local still or brew-house, leaving a trail of victims in its wake. One survivor's report tells of a snallygaster so entranced by the smell of whiskey mash that it dove headfirst into a brewing vat, where it quickly succumbed to the fumes and drowned. Habitat & Society Snallygasters might inhabit remote, backwoods area of Avistan, but are most often encountered in the wilds of Varisia. They prefer to nest in wooded, mountains regions where they can put their camouf lage to good use. Snallygasters are primarily active during the day, which they spend searching for food or scaring off rivals. A snallygaster claims a quite large territory, often hundreds of miles wide, though snallygasters rarely keep the same territory for more than a year at a time. Eventually, the snallygaster grows bored with the area-or is overcome by wanderlust-and sets off in search of a more interesting roost. When snallygasters meet, they regard each other coolly, but rarely fight over territory. The conf licts that do arise are almost never lethal, though the presence of a particularly valuable resource in the area, such as easy access to human victims or a reliable supply of alcohol, can turn such a contest into a bloody aerial combat. Snallygasters assemble during mating season since they have few opportunities to reproduce. Female snallygasters lay only one to two eggs per year, which they consume if the eggs are not quickly fertilized by a male snallygaster. Should a male snallygaster present himself, the female allows him to fertilize the egg, and then immediately retreats with it and hides it somewhere high in the mountains. Occasionally humans run across these melon-sized eggs and attempt to hatch them, usually with disastrous results. Snallygasters cannot be trained, and are lethal predators at the age of 4 weeks. Snallygasters are not afraid of humans, though they are intelligent enough to refrain from attacking large or well-armed groups of them. A snallygaster whose territory includes a human settlement genuinely enjoys terrorizing the community, often by flying just out of bow shot and screeching at the residents. It's no surprise then that snallygasters figure strongly in some early Varisian and Shoanti myths. The Shoanti name for the creature is a corruption of the Skald phrase for ""swift ghost,"" chosen because the creature's attacks come suddenly and silently, and also for the way the monster disappears into the forests after claiming a victim's life. When Chelish explorers arrived in Varisia, they further corrupted the name into the creature's modern appellation, ""snallygaster.""",800

Snow Leopard,3,animal,cold forests or mountains,Grayish fur covers this large cat that allows it to blend in with the shadow and light of snow drifts.,"Snow leopards are relatives of the common leopard and are found in the coldest regions of the world, inhabiting mountains ranges and snowy coniferous forests. Their lairs are typically rocky shelters lined with their own fur for warmth. Snow leopards are strong, agile, nocturnal hunters and their diet consists of livestock, wild boars, hares, and deer. Like most other big cats, they stalk and ambush their prey. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and devoured over a period of several days. Snow leopards are generally solitary creatures, though during mating season more than one can be encountered. A den typically contains 1d2 adults and 1d4 cubs. Cubs that are captured can be sold on the market for 500 gp or more. A snow leopard is about five feet long with light gray or smoke gray fur that turns white on its underbelly. Its fur is covered with large rings that contain smaller and darker spots of dark gray or black. Its fur is over one inch thick and provides it with warmth against the harshest of temperatures. Eyes are gray or dark blue. Its paws are large and thickfurred which enables it to maintain its footing on the most treacherous of snow-covered ground. Snow leopards are hunted by mraces for their fur which can be sold to furriers and made into coats, blankets, and so on. A typical male's coat fetches about 800 gp on the market. Snow leopards, unlike other great cats, do not roar. Rather they let out a low, soft moan. They attack from a distance leaping or pouncing on a foe and attacking with their claws and bite.

Solar,23,outsider,good-aligned plane,"This towering humanoid creature has shining topaz eyes, metallic skin, and three pairs of white wings.","Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin. Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand. Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter. In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus , laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be. Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities . Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been ""promoted"" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil. Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of halfcelestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child-while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways. All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshesals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.",615000
Soldier Thermite,4,vermin,any,This creature looks like a giant reddish-hued termite. Immense heat radiates from its body.,"Thermites are extraplanar vermin that dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are rarely encountered anywhere else . Once in a rare while a gang or band of these creatures stumble through a vortex and sets up their nest on the Material Plane. Such a nest is always located near a massive heat source . On their home plane, thermites build large underground nests. The bulk of the colony is maintained by the workers-whose job it is to construct the nest, forage for food, feed the queen and soldiers, and repair the nest. Soldiers defend the nest against intruders and trespassers. About a week after the nest is finished, the queen takes a king  and they construct a reproduction chamber where she lays 10-20 eggs each day over a period of a week. Young thermites are helpless and depend solely on the queen and workers for food, protection, and so on. Young become independent after several months, and the reproductives  fly off to form their own nests. The cycle above then repeats.  Thermites are red in color and about 5 or 6 feet long with large biting mandibles and segmented antennae. Soldiers are slightly larger than workers and have slightly larger heads with oversized mandibles. The queen can reach a length of 12 feet or longer and as she ages, she becomes bloated, resembling a giant reddish colored maggot. Reproductives resemble workers and soldiers but are slightly darker in color and have translucent reddish wings. Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off would-be interlopers. Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200

In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the moon's surface within its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a blood frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either is dead or escapes its territory. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a behavior that serves both to preserve energy and to avoid needless conflict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions.

Should the day come when Orcus weakens, Sonechard plans to be there to claim what he believes is rightfully his. Sonechard makes his home in a large castle called Chillshall that sits atop a plateau of scorched earth surrounded by a moat of blood. The walls are constructed of bone and sinew, and it is said that the souls of those who cross him are entombed within. Sonechard stands 14 feet tall and weighs about 3,500 pounds. Sonechard is almost always encountered with a large number of demons or undead at his side. When he enters battle, he usually unleashes a fireball at his foes immediately, and then follows it up with a circle of death effect or a suggestion. Dying creatures are subjected to his death knell spell-like ability and then raised via animate dead. Should Sonechard find himself on the losing end of a battle, he does not hesitate to retreat, covering his escape with summoned or created undead and demons. A defeat is not forgotten-or forgiven.

Soul Nibbler,2,magical beast,any,This creature appears to be a grayish-brown rat about a foot long.,"Soul nibblers are rats that have undergone genetic mutation due to continued feeding on essence ingots . The biological effects of a prolonged consumption of soul stuff are minimal. Soul nibblers are always black in color, and their eyes sometime glow with a sickly light. The magical changes wrought by their unholy diet, however, are more profound, granting the soul nibblers unique necromantic abilities. Having begun life as normal rats, soul nibblers behave in combat much like their mundane cousins. The primary difference between soul nibblers and standard rats is their bond to dark magic, which grants them the powers of energy drain and necromantic immunity. Essence Ingots Essence ingots are small rectangular bricks of blackened stone that contain the soul of a living creature. Creatures are trapped in essence ingots through the use of a great smelter, the location of which has been lost. A trapped spirit can be released by casting remove curse . A released soul reforms its material body in 1d4 rounds. An essence ingot has a hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 20. Note, however, that if an essence ingot is broken, the trapped soul is not released but is lost forever. Credit The soul nibbler first appeared in module G3 What Evil Lurks by Lance Hawvermale .

Soul Reaper,15,undead,any,"This sinister figure appears shrouded in a long, black hooded robe. Its face is hidden from view and its long wickedly-curved claws are deathly black in color. It grips a gleaming, silver-bladed scythe in its claws.","Soul reapers are vile undead with a fierce hatred for the living. They exist only to kill, and take great pleasure in slaying living creature they encounter. They kill without guilt, without feeling or remorse, and without emotion; drinking the soul of their victim to insure it never returns to life. Soul reapers have no ties to the land of the living, in that they have always existed and have always been. Their origins are unknown, but speculation says they stepped from the great void at the beginning of creation. It is thought that only six or seven of these creatures exist . Soul reapers are 12-foot tall humanoid creatures shrouded in long, black hooded cloaks. Though they are corporeal creatures, their form is either shrouded in utter darkness or formed of the stuff of shadows. No discernible facial features are visible under the hood. The creature's hands end in wicked claws of inky blackness that are always clutched tightly around its gleaming, sharp scythe. These creatures never speak and no one knows if they even can  Soul reapers haunt civilized lands searching for the next victim who will fall prey to the deadly scythe and its soul-draining powers. When it encounters a living creature, the soul reaper casts unholy aura on itself. It then pinpoints an enemy spellcaster and uses its deafness ability, or selects the most powerful foe  and hits it with blindness. Invisible opponents are no match for the soul reaper and it often targets them first, just to show them that they cannot hide from its deadly blade. When it closes to melee, the soul reaper uses a full attack with its scythe against its closest opponent. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",51200
Soulbound Doll,2,construct,any,This doll's glass eyes glisten with unmistakable curiosity as it comes to life with a fluid grace.,"These small, sentient dolls contain a fragment of another creature's soul. The binding process strips most of the individuality from the soul, making a new soulbound doll an almost blank slate. Despite this process, fragments of the original creature's personality remain. Soulbound dolls can serve as companions, surrogate children, servants, guards, and sentries, as desired by their creators. Creators of soulbound dolls typically take care to take soul fragments from people whose personality traits the crafters wish to see in their dolls. Construction A soulbound doll's body is made from wood, stone, or porcelain, with one exquisite item worth at least 300 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a deceased creature that must die at some point during the creation of the doll- as a result, most soulbound dolls are created by evil spellcasters. Other spellcasters can create soulbound dolls, but if the donor soul is unwilling, they may have alignment repercussions. An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a DC 20 Will save. Stripping a soul fragment from the dead does not prevent the rest of the soul from continuing on to the afterlife, nor does it prevent the body from later being resurrected or raised from the dead.

Spartolos,6,undead,any,"A skeleton clad in tarnished armor clatters in its grim march. A polished bronze breastplate, greaves, and helmet dutifully remain to protect this felled warrior, while its naked, skeletal hands still clutch a short spear and a round bronze shield. Yet, beneath its decrepit armor and moldering bones, a deftness and deadly intent linger on, embodied in a hellish light smoldering in its shadowed eye sockets.","Raised from the corpses of famed warriors and legendary legionaries, spartoi  walk again, dragged from death to do battle once more. Greater than mere unthinking corpses, like skeletal champions spartoi carry with them some vestige of their past lives and experiences. Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes called the ""sown men,"" spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi. A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment. Ecology As undead beings, spartoi have no need for food or shelter and have little effect on their environments. Yet despite being obedient undead, all spartoi seem to favor resting as disjoined piles of bones rather than standing corpses. Although the undead know no sensations of exertion, spartoi left to their own devices or without commands to do otherwise collapse into scattered remains. Whether such is a matter of tactics and subterfuge or fulfills some other need, the animate corpses give no hint. Spartoi detect as being of evil alignment merely because the powers animating them prove fundamentally foul. In some cases, spartoi raised from the corpses of particularly goodly or otherwise forceful individuals might retain the alignment they possessed in life. Habitat & Society The spartoi are undead skeletons-albeit much more powerful than other versions-designed for war. They have no wants or desires other than to serve their masters, and they carry no fear. Though they have some defense against channeled energy, the spartoi are just as susceptible to divine spellcasters as other undead. All spartoi spring into being with weaponry, typically a spear, buckler, and breastplate, though some rare individuals have been known to arise with more unusual armaments. In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives, and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to lack the coordination for such arms. In case, spartoi weaponry and armor typically bear the markings of ancient cultures, often appearing to be from lands near where the undead  were created. Despite their skill and cooperation in battle, spartoi have little interest in one another. Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their former personalities seem interested only in completing their master's will and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death. Such causes mconcerned with the necromantic arts to ponder over whether their magic draws forth an actual spirit to its bones, or merely causes a corpse to act with a hint of the personality that was bound to it in life. Creating a Spartolos A spartolos might be created in a number of ways. Most simply, a create undead spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively, one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds. Although relatively rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their lives. Mythic Seeds Numerous myths across Golarion tell of legendary, magical fangs that summon forth the spirits or corpses of powerful warriors. The most pervasive of these tales comes from the ancient myth of the Jiskan hero Strada, though countless variations exist in dozen of cultures across Avistan. Legends tell of the mythic hero Strada tasked by the devil Alichino with the impossible charge of besieging an unconquerable city. Seeking out the oracle of Gorum, god of battle, the hero was gifted the thousand fangs of the dragon Kathalphas, who was said to have grown an additional tooth with every champion she had slain. Told to sow these fangs into the dust surrounding the city, the hero praised Gorum and departed graciously. Upon reaching the city, he did as the priest had advised, and to his astonishment, the skeletons of the dragon's thousand victims leapt from the ground, clad in all the finery of epic warriors, and arrayed to do battle in Strada's name. The unconquerable city fell in an hour, much to the fury of capering Alichino, and for 90 splendorous years Strada ruled as king with an army of the world's greatest warriors ever guarding his palace gates. See the spartoi seeds sidebar for rules on using the magical teeth drawn from this myth.",2400
Spawning Canker,9,aberration,land,"Pale and bloodless, a brutally decapitated corpse lurches forth. Where a head should be instead lashes a forests of horrific, unnatural tentacles, whipping as though trying to simultaneously burrow deeper into and escape from its fleshy husk.","A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing, aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind. A typical spawning canker stands as tall as the humanoid body it infests, plus 2 to 3 feet of added height from its dozen or so wild tendrils. Slugspawn  Bloated alien worms the length of a man's forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub- Niggurath. These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them. Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it , a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug . If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation. Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills slugspawn in or on a host. After a slugspawn has reached a host's brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn's host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't last for long, though, as after a variable period  the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a near instantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren. Reproductive Rampage Moits of Shub-Niggurath, in both their spawning canker and slugspawn forms, exist for a single reason: to propagate their fouls species as their unknowable brood mother desires. Theirs are not the ways of obsessed cultists or otherworldly masterminds. Rather, they are akin to living diseases, massive viruses that infiltrate, infest, and overwhelm, desiring nothing more than to spread their kind and pave the way for a new, larger generation that might spawn in the name of the Goat with a Thousand Young, their very existence being an unholy prayer to her power. Moits lack agendas beyond spawning. In their alien philosophies, infesting a victim, growing into a canker, and then ""ascending"" is the ultimate glory. While slugspawn have only an instinctual impression of their role in the greater cycle, spawning cankers are true fanatics, obsessed with propagation. While they avoid competing with others of their kind, if resources are limited, each canker seeks to assure that it can spawn. The moits have no interest in rationing humanoid hosts to assure their allies or spawn have the means to reproduce. Instead, they care only for the moment and the immediate potential to spawn. Thus, whole regions might be wiped clean by the infectious invasion of these moits, which grow all the more desperate as hosts and, by extension, opportunities to fulfill their lives' only purpose diminish.",6400
Spear Urchin,4,vermin,temperate or warm oceans or coastlines,This strange-looking creature has a spherical body covered with hundreds or thousands of two-foot-long bright purple spines that darken to ominous black tips.,"Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach of their attacks via oceans currents or, more commonly, tides. Hunter Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like tongues that can whip out and pull food to them. Spear Urchins: These brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over to feed. Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this urchin's venom. Sea Urchins as Difficult Terrain The giant sea urchins presented here are fantastic evolutions of their much more common, smaller, and less offensive kin. Yet even the smaller common urchins can pose a problem for unwary adventurers. Sea urchins live in vast colonies on tidal rocks, and moving across a field of urchins can be quite awkward and painful. Their thousands of spines are just as sharp as those possessed by their larger kin, and they function as caltrops to anyone that walks over them. Worse, these spines are venomous, and can poison those who take damage from them. Those who succumb to the poison suffer searing pain that can sicken them for several minutes. Though uncomfortable, fortunately this venom doesn't actually inf lict either ability damage or ability drain. Sea Urchin Venom: Spines-injury; save Fort 11; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect victim is sickened for 1 minute; cure 1 save.",1200
Spectre,7,undead,any,"This translucent, ghostly figure fades into view from the damp mist, its face distorted by wrath into a hideous mask.","Spectres are evil undead that hate sunlight and living things. Most are the remnants of murdered or evil humans, their anger preventing them from entering the afterlife. Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places of their deaths, and seek to draw others into the lonely abyss of undeath. A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by those who knew the individual or have seen the individual's face in paintings or drawings. Spectres retain a strong sense of identity, and even ancient, insane spectres generally remain coherent. Evil historians and necromancers often try to ally with spectres for the knowledge they held in life and retain in undeath.",3200
Spellscar Fext,7,undead,any,"This undead horror's upper body is twisted and malformed, and its hands end in tangles of blunt, electric-blue tendrils.","The abominable undead known as Spellscar fexts are formed by wayward spellcasters who perish in the sprawling badlands of the Mana Wastes, their bodies and souls perverted by the unpredictable primal energies that surge throughout the Spellscar deserts. The average Spellscar fext stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. The unnatural and corruptive transformations a fallen victim undergoes as it turns into a Spellscar fext render its body hard and especially resilient to the magical energies of most spellcasters. In a peculiar twist, the same corruptive energy that causes spells to bounce off of Spellscar fexts' hides also strangely renders them susceptible to glass and glass-based weapons. Talented gunsmiths from Alkenstar have managed to craft glass bullets for rif le-wielding adventurers and monster hunters for the purpose of eradicating Spellscar fexts.",3200
Sphinx,8,magical beast,warm deserts or hills,"This creature has the body of a lion, the wings of a falcon, and the head and torso of a beautiful human woman.","Although there are mdifferent species of sphinx, the one certain scholars refer to as the ""gynosphinx""  is a wise and majestic creature that is nevertheless terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts , sphinxes are careful and methodical in their decision-making, and pride themselves on their cold logic and impartiality. They have little patience for the lesser sphinx variants, seeing them as little better than animals. Sphinxes love riddles and complicated dilemmas, and treasure strange facts and arcane trivia far more than gold or gems While not great scholars in traditional sense, sphinxes' great appreciation of puzzles leads them to research shallowly in a wide variety of subjects, and they can often be invaluable sources of information, especially when making use of their magical abilities. They are usually happy to barter with other races, and regularly trade material goods for information or new and interesting quandaries. They make excellent guardians for temples, tombs, and other important locations, so long as they are kept adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great value on politeness, but can be dangerously temperamental-while they may decide to share their latest riddles with travelers out of altruism, they think little of devouring those who don't give their dilemmas adequate attention or provide useful insight. Sphinxes are typically 10 feet long and about 800 pounds. While their wings are capable of holding them aloft for long periods of time, they are poor fliers, and prefer to land before engaging foes, lashing out with their powerful claws. Though fiercely territorial, they tend to give intruders plenty of warning before attacking.",4800
Spider Eater,5,magical beast,temperate forests,"This strange beast resembles a wasp the size of a horse, but with the head of a spider and two long appendages ending in pincers.","An amalgam of dangerous creatures, this predator, as its name suggests, prefers to hunt and feed upon spiders. Their greatest boon to spider hunting, aside from their stinger, ability to fly, and strong pincers, is their ability to slip through the stickiest of webs in order to get to their prey. Unfortunately for other creatures, when a spider eater is denied its preferred prey, it seeks out living creature it can find to serve as a host for its ravenous young. When hunting, a spider eater drops from the air onto its victim, stinging the prey with its barbed tail. The creature then returns to the air and hovers, waiting for its venom to take hold. Once the opponent succumbs to paralysis, the spider eater lands again, either to feed or implant its egg. Although more intelligent than the typical beast, to the point where it can understand a language , the spider eater is relatively slow-witted. Nevertheless, it is intelligent enough that it resists training-those who seek to ally with spider eaters must befriend them via diplomacy and gifts of spiders to feed upon or implant eggs into, or via intimidation and coercion. A spider eater measures roughly 14 feet long and stands 6 feet tall. The creature has a wingspan just over 20 feet and weighs almost 2,000 pounds.",1600
Spider Swarm,1,vermin,any,"An awful, scuttling mass of legs and mandibles scrambles forward out of the darkness.","The sight of a carpet of swarming spiders is unsettling indeed-particularly when the swarm is made up of spiders each the size of a gold coin and possessing bladelike mandibles capable of lacerating flesh with sickening ease. A swarm of spiders is a colonial mass of arachnids that relies on overwhelming much larger prey with sheer numbers rather than catching smaller snacks. While spider swarms spin webs, these webs are incapable of catching larger prey and typically serve the swarm as a lair rather than a method of capturing dinner.",400
Spine Dragon,16,dragon,temperate hills,This dragon bears a forests of razor-sharp crystalline spines. Its wings are transparent and seem almost to be made of glass.,"Particularly notorious in the badlands of Numeria, spine dragons are similar in appearance to true dragons, but do not progress through draconic age categories. Their abilities and defenses make them singularly adept at handling the alien threats and strange constructs that lurk in this realm, and as a result, spine dragons have become one of Numeria's most successful predators. Of course, a spine dragon is much more than a predator. As with mtrue dragons, spine dragons are particularly vain and enjoy being groveled to. It's not uncommon for them to assume the role of god for ignorant tribes of giants. They also have a particular love of crystalline treasure and magic items-a spine dragon's horde is usually sparse on the classic ""carpet of coins"" but just as valuable overall in content as those of true dragons. A spine dragon is 60 feet long and 20 feet high, and weighs 16,000 pounds.",76800

Spiny Eurypterid,9,vermin,warm oceans,"Two large pincers grasp at the air before this sleek creature, while a finned tail bristling with a long, thin stinger rises from behind.","Known to some as sea scorpions, eurypterids are waters crustaceans that blur the line between their terrestrial cousins and lobsters. Primeval and voracious, these vermin range in size from relatively harmless ochre eurypterids the size of a dog up to the truly immense spitting eurypterids. There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whaleeating eurypterids by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common-an aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of waters indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",6400
Spirit Naga,9,aberration,temperate marshes,"Yellowed, venom-dripping fangs fill the human-like mouth of this sinister serpentine monstrosity.","Morbid-minded and wretched to look upon, spirit nagas are the witches of the naga race, hateful outcasts long shunned for their dark powers and loathsome ways. A typical spirit naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous serpent and a tangle of greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most measure 14 feet long but weigh less than 300 pounds. Spirit nagas delight in places of death and desolation. Battle-scarred ruins, untended graveyards, despoiled forests, and tangled swamps all attract these repulsive creatures. Where guardian nagas favor places of innate sanctity, spirit nagas seek out places of fundamental corruption, sites they believe to be imbued with dark magics. The crypts of long-dead tyrants, the death places of great heroes, and the ruins of nefarious keeps all attract these wretched serpents. Most spirit nagas believe themselves to be the inheritors of some mysterious dark favor, seeing their innate magical talents as evidence of such. Most commune with vague powers of death and devastation, working profane rites and seeking grotesque auguries from cultic forces. To aid them, spirit nagas often use their enchanting gaze, changing victims into fawning fanatics and would-be sacrif ices. Spirit nagas occasionally band together in small groups-some seeming to mimic the covens of hags. While a particular plot or foe might bring these deadly serpents together for a short time, spirit nagas are loyal only to themselves, and such alliances always end in deadly betrayal.",6400
Spirit of Adoration,15,outsider,any,"This armored woman appears to be carved from living marble, her angelic wings rising behind the shape of a heavenly warrior. In one hand she grips a fearsome glaive, every movement of which paints the air around her with swirls and flourishes of magical energy.","The Spirit of Adoration is among Shelyn's greatest servants, an intelligent personification of true love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. She rarely comes to the mortal world, and it is even rarer for her to enter battle, but when that time comes, it is said that there is nothing she cannot bend or break in pursuit of her goal. The spirit's true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman-usually a human but sometimes an elf- dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining steel glaive. When interacting with easily frightened mortals , she uses her shapechanging powers to look like a human or elf of normal height, attractive according to the standards of the local people, but she never makes herself so beautiful as to cause jealousy or inspire inappropriate comments or attention. When not carrying out Shelyn's will, the spirit enjoys dancing in clouds, across lakes, and on mountainstops, whether on Golarion or Nirvana, ignoring the occasional bolt of lightning that strikes her. Ecology Although she does not need to eat, the spirit loves the occasional taste of food or wine, especially wedding cake and champagne toasts. While she does not need to sleep, she loves to dream, deciding the framework of her dreams before she sleeps and enjoying the mystery of how they play out. Sleeping is the only time she is still, as she loves motion, frequently dancing with joy or gesturing with her hands while speaking. Her primary role is as a messenger of love and beauty, encouraging mortals to pursue love and create art, and for much of her work she is present but invisible, speaking just the right words to accomplish her mission and vanishing thereafter. The spirit only kills when she absolutely has to, such as when confronted by mindless creatures or irredeemable undead, and even then only if sparing them would create a threat to others. She prefers to let her aura of charming change hostile creatures into temporary allies, giving her time to move aggressive opponents away from innocents and speak words of diplomacy under more amiable conditions. She uses her stunning bolts against creatures she believes can be talked into surrender or peace, reserving her glaive and attack spells for recalcitrant foes and alien or mindless things that absolutely cannot understand love or beauty. Habitat & Society The spirit is a creature of love and is open with her emotions to all mortals. She treasures the presence of every infant, child, adult, and animal, and can appreciate the beauty of landscape, no matter how stark, blasted, or strange. She is generous, compassionate, and tolerant, and those who meet her under pleasant circumstances can't help but agree that she is one of the nicest creatures they've ever met. However, most of her interactions on the mortal world occur when some great love or beautiful work of art is threatened. At these times she grows quiet, her eyes burn with the fire of true love threatened, and her face becomes the stern mask of an artist lost in the moment of finishing her masterpiece. When inspired by this cause, her hands wield glaive, spell, and ray in a beautiful and enthralling dance, as though they move to the very music of creation. The spirit has an excellent memory for names and faces, and enjoys tracing the family trees of Shelyn's agathion servitors, often recognizing a distant mortal relation 10 generations later. She is friends with all of the goddess's minions, and shares this affection with their mortal relatives. Though she is not a gossip, she listens to her fellow celestials and is aware of who they've helped in the mortal world; she keeps tabs on those who have benefited from the goddess's favor in the past and, if necessary, might be willing to repay a past favor. The minions of Zon-Kuthon fill her with pity. Whenever she encounters them, she tries to steal them away to a temple of her creator and have the priests try to cleanse the mental stains of that dark god. She tries this with his divine servants as well, with much more limited success.",51200
Spirit Oni,2,outsider,any,"This evil-looking animated mask shows the face of a horned fiend, its eyes popping and its leering smile full of fangs.","Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual-an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own. Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here. While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them. When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices-but the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more bef itting their egos and desires.",600

Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of waters indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",19200
Spitting Sea Serpent,9,dragon,waters,"The body length of a these serpents is roughly 15 to 18 feet, with a girth of up to 3 feet. They are covered with rough-edged scales of brown, green, or blue coloration, giving their hides a mottled appearance. Their heads are short, with thick, muscular necks concealed beneath a webbed fringe.","Spitting sea serpents are a fiercely territorial if not terribly intelligent species that can be a great hazard on unfamiliar coastlines. They are renowned for their great ability to spit globs of acidic spittle onto creatures that threaten them. The spitting sea serpent always tries to use its spitting attack against that anger it, using its bite and constriction attacks against food or as a last resort. A spitting sea serpent prefers to dwell in shallow coastlines waters and coastlines, and avoids deep waters where they are ill-equipped to handle encounters with large marine predators, against which their ability to spit is ineffective. They prefer to live in wild, uncivilized lands, and fiercely protect their hunting grounds from intrusion by other predators. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Patrick Lawinger.",6400
Splinter Drake,10,plant,temperate forests,"This creature looks like a wingless dragon about 12 feet long whose flesh is actually dark brown bark with a greenish hue. A bushy mane of twigs, branches, leaves, and vines circles its dragon-like head and a series of thorny spines runs the length of its back. Two backward curved horns, apparently constructed of the same hardened bark as its body, jut from the creature's head. A dark brown snake-like tongue flicks across its fangs as it advances.","Splinter drakes are plant creatures that resemble large wingless dragons. They haunt dense forests and make their lairs amid the tangled underbrush, generally in hard-to-locate places. Much like true dragons, splinter drakes are extremely territorial and attack creatures that wander carelessly into their domain and remain for an extended amount of time. A typical splinter drake's territory covers an area of several square miles around its lair. Unlike true dragons, splinter drakes do not value nor keep treasure. Any treasure found in or around their lairs are likely all that remains of a past meal. They generally keep compwith evil fey, evil druids, and corrupt rangers. Such allies are allowed a bit of leeway when treading on a splinter drake's territory, but if certain boundaries are crossed or privileges abused, splinter drakes have no problems eating someone they once called friend. Splinter drakes generally do not associate with others of their kind, except during mating season  when a mated pair is likely to be encountered. During mating, the female splinter drake deposits a host of eggs  into the ground. Within several months, 1d4 new splinter drakes grow from the ground. Splinter drakes reach maturity within 1 year. A splinter drake is about 12 feet long and weighs around 800 pounds. Splinter drakes typically ambush potential prey whenever possible, striking from surprise with their thorny breath weapon and poison. Once it releases its first blast, it charges into battle and slashes and tears at its foes with its claws and bite. If outnumbered or combat turns against it, a splinter drake seeks the quickest means of exit possible unless cornered, defending its lair, or starving, in which case it fights to the death. Rarely, though not completely unheard of, a splinter drake takes levels in a class, almost always the druid or ranger class.",9600
Spore Rat,2,plant,any,This creature resembles a dog-sized rat with matted brownish fur and ruby red eyes. Its mouth is lined with sharpened teeth and its claws appear to be razor-sharp.,"Spore rats are thought to be the result of an ancient ensorcelled experiment involving giant rats and one or more unknown plant or fungus creatures. No evidence exists to prove or disprove this theory however, so very little is known as to their true origin. Spore rats favor damp environments such as rainforests and swamps where they build their nests and lairs from the underbrush, overgrowth, and mud or slime. A typical lair contains 10 or more creatures, with males dominating the pack nearly 2-to-1. Females generally avoid combat and confrontation unless the entire nest is threatened. Both males and females always fight to the death if defending their young. If threatened, a spore rat releases a spore cloud in an effort to detour would be aggressors. Failing this, it lashes out with its bite attempting to nauseate its opponents. Given the chance, a spore rat flees combat unless cornered. Spore rats exist on a diet of plants, berries, and various funguses and lichens. Food is gathered by the hunters  and carried back to the lair where it is stored in holes for future use . A typical spore rat hunting band often journeys up to 1 mile from its lair if no closer food source can be found. A spore rat is typically up to 3 feet long and weighs about 30 pounds. Its fur is greenish-brown and is not actually fur at all, but tightly packed funguses and mushrooms. Its eyes are ruby red or pale yellow. Its claws and teeth are always filthy and are brownish-white in color. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",600
Spriggan,3,humanoid,hills or forests,"Flecks of saliva drip from the corners of this filthy and ill-smelling humanoid, and his large pointed ears twitch at every sound.","When the gnomes first traveled to the mortal realm from the distant land of the fey, some found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense of joy. Seeing only the threats of the new world but none of its wonders, they grimly resolved to survive no matter the cost. Their innate magic responded to this twisted goal by reshaping them in mind and body over the course of mgenerations, transforming them into the creatures known as spriggans. Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for these poor souls, so they lead lives of violence and malice. The best they can manage in place of positive emotions is a muted satisfaction when they make another suffer. Spriggans resemble ugly gnomes with an alien, feral appearance. Mare gaunt and haggard.

Spring-Heeled Jack,3,fey,any,"With jet-black skin and a small but menacing pair of horns, this goateed, impish creature wields a bloody knife and a wicked grin.","Half fable, half truth, Spring-Heeled Jack is the subject of popular gossip as well as mythic folklore. Often said to be a fiend of unknown origins, the cruel-eyed night terror is infamous for his love of trickery and spontaneous bursts of violence. Those who have seen his visage and lived to tell their story often have scars to prove the authenticity of their account, as Spring-Heeled Jack's menacing knife is almost as famous as he is. By all accounts, Spring-Heeled Jack is a small and roguish-looking man with horns, garbed in a tattered vest, cape, and trousers. However odd his clothing may be, it is generally agreed that the sight of his dreadful cape or even the shadow of his hideously quick movements chills the hearts of men. Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds. Ecology Spring-Heeled Jack is a cruel being with a mysterious past; the stories of his origin vary wildly, though it is widely thought that he was at one point human, and through some twist of fate or evil transaction lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers. The truth, however, is far different. Spring-Heeled Jack is a fey creature-or perhaps a single name given to a whole race of fey creatures related to the quickling- and native to the ever-shifting First World. Tired of the realm's inconsistent reality and inherently unflappable victims, who simply manifest again after death, Jack is fond of traveling to the Material Plane, where his mayhem is more appreciated and the results more permanent. On his forays into the Material Plane, Spring-Heeled Jack quickly takes to the night and earns a reputation for his gruesome killing sprees and tendency to flee the crime scene by leaping onto buildings, thus giving him his name. His heinous crimes usually render him one of the most loathed criminals in a particular area, and communities where he is seen act swiftly and with urgency to capture him. Knowing precisely how far he can push the local populace, Spring-Heeled Jack often disappears for several weeks after a particularly violent crime before revealing himself again. Spring-Heeled Jack subsists primarily on the flesh of raw animals, finding the meat of humans too stringy for his liking. His tastes are versatile, though, and he's just as prone to eat a deer as he is to consume a common house rat or beetle. The impish creature goes about most of his activities in a quirky, grotesque fashion, enamored with odd and often disturbing items and as quick to imitate the creatures he observes as he is to kill them. Habitat & Society Reports of Spring-Heeled Jack always place him in a large city or the outskirts of one during the night, though even the best trackers have trouble explaining where he goes during the day or during the weeks when there is not so much as a trace of him. During those periods when he goes to ground, Spring- Heeled Jack often lurks in the wilds, either resting in secluded forests or observing the animals and other creatures native to such environs. His innate fascination with the Material Plane is an odd contrast to his love of causing others pain; the only thing he enjoys more than witnessing nature is destroying it. Hunters occasionally come across desecrated animal carcasses, returning to the tavern and proposing tales of some huge and horribly strong creature in the wilds. No one would ever guess that the gory mess of flesh and bone was caused by a tiny man with a jagged knife. Spring-Heeled Jack's knife is often his only company, and years of self-inf licted solitude drive him to consider the blade his best and only friend. The wicked knife- which he refers to as ""Love"" all too frequently, according to survivors of his attacks-possesses no special properties, but is finely wrought and clearly of otherworldly origin. Stained with the blood of hundreds of victims, Spring- Heeled Jack's weapon leaves strange scars that are impossible to reproduce. Brash drunkards in taverns can be found lifting their shirts and displaying old wounds, claiming they come from Spring-Heeled Jack's beloved blade, while honest victims need not point out their true scars, which always speak for themselves. Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled Jack sometimes tires of simply killing victims, and instead decides to let his prey live to tell the tale. While he does not commit his heinous crimes for popularity, the fey revels in the reputation he has earned and the fear that registers in people's eyes as he pounces upon them, and often spies on people simply to hear the far-fetched rumors surrounding himself. He frequently plays up these odd rumors and accounts, even whispering pre-scripted lines to his victims before he kills them, fancying himself a poet reciting to a very select audience. Beyond brief encounters with terrified victims and his strange relationship with his weapon, Spring- Heeled Jack is alone in his endeavors. Society holds no place for him, but that's fine by the sociopathic fey. His high esteem for misfortune, trickery, and deceit are matched by few, and he cannot be bought off, persuaded, or convinced. The only thing that could possibly distract him in the middle of pursuing a victim is the possibility of some other, more exciting challenge elsewhere. When Spring-Heeled Jack encounters a foe he deems too powerful, he takes to the roofs as soon as he realizes his situation, often to the frustration of bounty hunters and law enforcement alike.",800
Sprite,1,fey,temperate forests,"This tiny winged elf-like creature has delicate features, transparent wings, and fair skin. It wears brightly colored clothes and its eyes sparkle with light.","A reclusive folk, sprites live in meadows and woodland glens, where they have appointed themselves the monitors of their lands. They stand about 2 feet tall and fly by means of their tiny diaphanous wings. Sprites have very delicate features with tiny, upturned noses and large pointed ears. Their eyes sparkle like moonlight on a forests lakes, and their tiny, high-pitched voices sound almost like music. Sprites are shy and reclusive, avoiding contact with other races; only druids have regular contact with sprites, and indeed mdruids get their training from sprites. However, sprites detest evil and attack it on sight with their weapons, preferring to strike from ambush while invisible. If possible, they render their victim unconscious using their envenomed arrows, then spirit the creature away to some remote location where it is placed without weapons or gear and left to fend for itself. Creatures that have demonstrated especially evil characteristics may be slain outright, however. Unlike their pixie cousins, sprites are not especially mischievous by nature, and prefer to be left alone.

As their name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites can breathe both air and waters without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep. Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with the following exceptions: They have the waters and amphibious subtypes; they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their Swim score is +12 .

Its four forelimbs sprout from its body-two from the hunched back and the other two from high on the hindquarters. A fifth limb grows from the middle of its back.","Squealers are carnivorous predators found in dense forests. They are voracious creatures and spend a good part of their day hunting food. A squealer attacks using its bite and claws. One of its favorite tactics is to hide in a tree, grasping a limb with three of its claws. When prey passes beneath, it swings down to attack. If it can grapple its prey, it drops from the tree, raking with its hind legs. Squealers communicate with others of their kind using a series of grunts, growls, and squeals.

Stabbing Beast,15,outsider,land or urban,"This cottage-sized scorpion-man moves with an eerie grace and an intelligent, murderous intent.","The Stabbing Beast is the herald of Norgorber, the god of greed, murder, secrets, and poison. It is an incredibly dangerous predator, a creature of immense strength that uses its keen intellect and deadly poison to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural form is that of an huge scorpion, but it can also assume an armored humanoid shape suitable for stealth or interacting with Norgorber's followers. Though its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets. The Stabbing Beast enjoys the compof mortals in the same way that a well-fed barn cat enjoys the compof mice. It sometimes ""plays"" with these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit or according to Norgorber's greater plans. It ignores most creatures as if they were unimportant or not even alive, bowling over these irrelevant people in its way and casually murdering those who make nuisances of themselves. Ecology The Stabbing Beast is guilty of thousands of killings and has no fear of death. It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it, despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past; Norgorber wiped its memory of these failures when he resurrected his herald. Norgorber's herald is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or regret for death or injury. When the cult of Norgorber summons the Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast may select its own target-or none at all- in exchange for its services. The Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative bile, swallowing them in its scorpion form, and regurgitating them when it returns to its lair deep beneath the planar metropolis of Axis. Habitat & Society The herald of Norgorber lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely inert like a clockwork device that has run down. It reacts to prayers to Norgorber as if they were echoes of its master's voice, drawing its attention without violence and bringing it to full alertness.",51200

Star monarchs spin streamers of sticky silver, weaving evanescent gossamer cocoons to enrobe those who slumber under their protection. These cocoons sublimate into wisps of half-remembered dreams with the coming of dawn. Star monarchs rarely intervene directly in combat, more often helping good creatures by aiding them from the shadows, guiding their paths, or guarding them while they sleep.

Star-Spawn of Cthulhu,20,aberration,any,"A mountains form lumbers to life, a hideous creature only accidentally humanoid in shape, its hateful face a writhing mass of tentacles.","Of all the strange and malefic denizens of the Dark Tapestry, few match the terror caused by this titanic race. Hailing from a mad star whose light cannot be seen by conventional telescopes, the smallest of these behemoths stand nearly 30 feet in height. Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems almost to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their eldest source-they are the star-spawn of Cthulhu. Ecology The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy-their form is not fixed. They can absorb parts of their bodies or enlarge others as they will-a trait they often use with their claws or tentacles to dramatically extend their reach in combat beyond that which might normally be available to a creature of their shape and size. Despite this mutable shape, though, the star-spawn generally do not deviate far from the form of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely due to the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master who lies dead but dreaming in the lost city of R'lyeh. Habitat & Society Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the starspawn of Cthulhu are not more waters in nature than they are terrestrial-that they are often found associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the Dark Tapestry, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual expansion of the Dark Tapestry to replace all that exists with its strange realities. The star-spawn of Cthulhu have little regard for indigenous life, yet they cannot proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a man might move into a house he thinks to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations. Their methods seldom vary from world to world-those whose intellects they can inf luence via dreams and nightmares are besieged as they sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies that toil to do much of the spawn's work for them, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, genocide, or worse, the spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults receive for their  aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns. That these plans for eradication often span the length of centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude-the spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are set and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This does grant some worlds with the capacity to discover the spawns' influence opportunity to delay or even defeat their world's star-spawned doom, but such tales of triumph are unfortunately rare in the face of the Dark Tapestry's relentless tides. Great Cthulhu While the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the Dark Tapestry and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord Cthulhu dwells upon a distant planet far removed from Golarion. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpsecity of R'lyeh deep under a great oceans, his dreams resonate still in the minds of his spawn, and from there touch upon the dreams of mslumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds-including Golarion. Cthulhu himself is likely as powerful compared to his spawn as the spawn themselves are to the bulk of humanity, and thus statistics for this creature are relatively meaningless. Suffice it to say, if Cthulhu were to rise from his slumber, he could travel to world upon which his spawn dwell, and as such, Golarion is far from safe should the stars ever come right for his awakening.",307200

Steward of the Skein,15,outsider,any,"This plate-clad woman has large bird wings augmented with overlapping pieces of metal. Her armor is adorned with skulls, and her open-faced helm reveals nothing of her features but a pair of intensely-glowing eyes.","The Steward of the Skein is Pharasma's foremost agent in the mortal realm, a mighty warrior sent to restore the balance of fate, announce a particularly auspicious birth or death, or deliver a world-shaking prophecy. Mtimes her presence on Golarion is as an incorporeal shade, making a pronouncement and then fading away, though countless creatures over the eons have felt the stunning impact of her armored fists. No mortal can recall seeing her in relation to the death of Aroden, and her role as messenger of prophecy has all but disappeared since that time. The Steward is emotionally distant, and seems to have difficulties relating to mortals. Some speculate that she was driven slightly mad by the Last Azlanti's death, and others believe she sees the past, present, and future simultaneously, leading her to treat mortals as temporary objects in the skein of fate, much the way a beekeeper has little regard for individual bees. When viewed by a Medium or Small creature, she always appears to be exactly the same height as the viewer, though her size does not change, and the few documented sightings of her by larger creatures describe her as no more than 6 feet tall. Ecology The Steward is timeless and ageless, and capable of patiently waiting hundreds of years for a particular event to occur. She has been found deep underground, standing silently like a golem, only to snap to attention when a particular individual approaches, delivering her message and then vanishing. She has likewise appeared in cities or remote areas, ignoring all who speak to her, stunning those who try to harm her, and waiting for the right time to speak. It is unknown why Pharasma has her act this way rather than appearing at the necessary time, but her priests believe the herald's presence is enough to align the strands of fate to suit the goddess' will, much as standing in a stream can change the course of a floating leaf. On at least two occasions she has waited in a prominent Pharasmin temple, rarely reaching out to bless the faithful, and in one case a loyal member of the church found her standing in a field and built a temple around her. The Steward only kills when it is Pharasma's will. She prefers to use her stunning gaze, her charm and hold magic, and similar nonlethal methods for dealing with opponents, giving them ample opportunities to flee. She is sparse with her healing, only using it to save those who Pharasma needs for future events-when present at great battles in history, she healed only a few, and restored but one or two who had recently died. The herald is ruthless when dealing with the undead, however, blasting them with her full power. Habitat & Society The Steward is a loner and has little interest in the desires of mortals. She is more personable with other planar servitors of her creator, but her unique role places her above them in the religious hierarchy, and she does not like fraternizing too much with her underlings lest she distract them from what Pharasma has planned for them. Conversely, she is extremely interested when one of the goddess's other servants is due to give birth or die. Though the Steward has no interest in procreating on her own, celestial or half-celestial birth is especially interesting to her, from both a physical and a spiritual standpoint-perhaps as proxy to Pharasma herself, whose presence would certainly overwhelm the newborn and confuse its role in the tapestry of fate. Likewise, she has an almost morbid curiosity about one of her fellow servitors dying, and has an almost-precognitive sense for such things, making her sudden appearance next to other servants of Pharasma in the Material Plane slightly worrisome. Occasionally she is called to testify in Pharasma's Court about the deeds or fate of a particular soul. When not following a direct order from the goddess, the Steward has been known to travel the planes slaying undead, following the rivers of Souls and protecting them from greedy daemons and other soul-devouring creatures. She relishes the opportunity to chase and slaughter the outsider minions of Urgathoa, and has torn apart her herald  several times.",51200

Instead of hair, its head is covered with writhing, deadly asps. Its mouth is filled with razor-sharpened fangs.","Though the word gorgon is often associated with the deadly bull-like creature that turns a victim to stone with its breath weapon, the true gorgons are three sisters; Euryale, Sthenno, and Medusa. They are the daughters of the god Phorcys and the goddess Ceto. Euryale and Sthenno were born immortal and are hideous creatures with writing snakes for hair, brass claws, wings, and a gaze that can turn living creature into stone. Phorcys tasked them with guarding the entrance to the Underworld. Medusa was born mortal and was very beautiful. Phorcys sent her to the Material Plane so all could gaze upon the beauty of his daughter. Medusa's beauty rivaled that of some of the goddesses, and some of them grew jealous of Medusa, particularly the goddess Athena. Her beauty also turned the heads of some of the gods, and when Poseidon seduced her in a temple to Athena, the goddess became enraged and changed the beautiful Medusa into a creature as hideous as her sisters. Poseidon turned from his love, never to return again. Medusa, enraged, fled into the deserts and never came back to civilization. The hero Perseus was tasked with killing the gorgon known as Medusa and bringing her head to King Polydectes as a wedding present. Using a magic shield given to him by the gods, he avoided Medusa's deadly gaze and severed her head. From her serpentine body sprang the children of Poseidon, creatures similar in appearance to their mother. These creatures escaped into the world and are called medusa. Sthenno and Euryale long for their sister's return or their meeting with her in the Underworld. Yet being immortal, they cannot enter the Realm of the Dead. Thus, both know they will never see their beloved sibling again. Their cries are said to be audible on the wind as a high-pitched shrill akin to a bird's cry. Both Sthenno and Euryale are 10 feet tall and weigh around 600 pounds or more. Sthenno's eyes are blue; Euryale's eyes are copper. Sthenno and Euryale rarely enter combat unless pressed or provoked. They are both deadly combatants and use their claws, bite, snakes, and petrifying gaze with precision force.

While often found in bays and estuaries, some breeds of stingray can make their home in rivers far upstream from salt waters. Stingrays, like their larger manta ray cousins, use a form of electrolocation to find prey in the silt-laden waters.

Stirge,0.5,magical beast,temperate or warm swamps,"This insectoid creature has two pairs of bat wings, a tangle of thin legs, and a needle-sharp proboscis.","Stirges are vicious, blood-drinking swamps pests that prey on wild animals, livestock, and unwary travelers. While weak individually, swarms of the creatures are capable of draining a man dry in minutes, leaving only a desiccated husk in their wake. Closer to mammals than insects, stirges carry their bodies through the air on four fleshy wings, searching out warm-blooded prey. They are fond of hiding near watersing holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins. After feeding they flap heavily off into the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again. Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a wingspan of twice that, and weigh just under a pound. Their coloration is rust-red or reddish-brown with a dirty yellow underbelly, though stirges that have not fed in some time are often pale pink, their color deepening as they gorge.",200
Stirge Demon,10,outsider,any,"The creature is a loathsome cross between a human, a stirge, and an abyssal fly. It stands on four stirge-like hind legs and grasps with its humanlike forelimbs, which end in chitinous claw-like fingers. It has the wings of a stirge, though wrinkled and seemingly useless. Its stirge-like head has distinctly human features and is topped with a bristled, backswept mane. Its mouth is tiny and filled with fangs, though its nose is long and sharp and is used to pierce and draw blood.","One of the most foul and despicable of all demonkind, the stirge demon hates all other demonic races and usually attacks them on sight. It savors the blood of vrocks and hezrous, but generally avoids more powerful demonic races. Stirge demons play no role in the Abyssal armies as most demon lords and princes find them hard to control and consider them pests to be exterminated. Other demons loathe them as well, and usually attack them when they are encountered. A stirge demon is about 10 feet long and weighs 800 pounds. Stirge demons enter combat and attempt to drone as mof their opponents to sleep as they can. Creatures that resist are attacked with claws and bite. Once the stirge demon has droned all its opponents to sleep, or they have fled, it feasts on sleeping creatures, draining their blood. If outnumbered or overmatched, a stirge demon does not engage an enemy. If confronted by foes more powerful than it, the stirge demon uses its greater teleport to escape.

Stone Giant,8,humanoid,temperate mountains,"This giant has chiseled, muscular features and a flat, forwardsloping head, looking almost as if it were carved of stone.","Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed in shades of brown and gray to match the stone around them. Adults are about 12 feet tall, weigh about 1,500 pounds, and can live to be 800 years old. Stone giants fight from a distance whenever possible, but if they can't avoid melee, they favor gigantic clubs chiseled out of stone. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless, blending in with the background, then move forward to throw rocks and surprise their foes. Stone giants prefer living in enormous caves in highaltitude, rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a few days' travel from other bands of stone giants, and even raise shared herds of goats and other livestock between tribes. Older stone giants tend to wander away from the tribe for a signif icant period of time in their later years, either living in seclusion somewhere or attempting to merge into other humanoid civilizations. After decades of this self-imposed exile, those who return do so as stone giant elders. Stone Giant Elders Some stone giants develop special abilities related to their environment. Called elders, these stone giants have Charisma scores of at least 15 and three spell-like abilities .

Stone ropers are mottled gray and brown like stone and have a rock-like body. Cutting a stone roper open reveals its treasure . Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires its strong, sticky strands. A stone roper attacks anything that comes within 50 feet by suddenly shooting out its tentacle strands. It prefers to attack two victims at once, each with three strands. The first two victims struck are affected with its venom pulse. If this succeeds, they are immediately released before they can be affected by the stone roper's Strength damage weakening effect.

Such violet coloration is considered to be good luck among storm giants, and those possessing it tend to become leaders among their kind. Adults are typically 21 feet tall and weigh 12,000 pounds. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old. When at rest, they prefer to wear short, loose tunics belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and headbands. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, with anklets , rings, or circlets being most common. Yet when they outfit themselves for battle, they don shimmering breastplates and wield enormous greatswords and bows. Storm giants tend to be reclusive, prefering to dwell along remote coastlines or on tropical islands. Yet like their namesakes, they are prone to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil and can be brutal, dangerous foes when insulted. In battle, they prefer to send a hail of arrows to rain down on their foes, only drawing their greatswords after opponents get inside their bow range. Storm giants live in well-constructed towers, castles, or walled settlements, and prefer to live off the land. They maintain enormous, well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of farmland per group. They often hire other humanoids, such as elves or humans, to help them run their massive farms.

Their hair color and eye color range across the spectrum just as a normal human, though most tend to have dark hair and eyes. Stormwardens prefer to avoid combat, but if provoked, they open combat using their longswords, attempting to slay their opponents before escaping to their lair.

Strix,0.33,monstrous humanoid,temperate mountains,"The wings of a monstrous raven cloak this leanly muscled, onyx-skinned humanoid. With eyes like a nocturnal predator he considers his surroundings, as if scanning for prey.","Devil's Perch, an infamous reach of Avistan's southwestern coast, has long captured the imaginations of the Chelish people. For untold centuries, gruesome deaths and diabolical shadows have haunted the region's spires, while local folklore weaves tales of winged devils. There strange rock spurs and unnaturally deep abysses make the heights deadly and nearly impossible to reach by land, and those who manage to survive the pitiless environment swiftly discover that the land's inhabitants, the dark-winged strix, do not welcome trespassers. Winged humanoids, the strix fiercely defend both their land and their air, claiming dominion over all reaches within sight of Ciricskree, the Screeching Spire. Deadly but wise, savage yet content with their realm, the strix would prefer to live quietly amid the towers of Devil's Perch, yet time and tradition have taught them the wingless peoples of the shores and lowlands cannot be trusted, and that only fear and bloodshed will protect their ancient lands. The common strix stands just over 6 feet tall, with males and females being roughly the same size. Sharply pointed ears, pupilless eyes, and slitted nostrils distinguish the race, though their 12-foot wingspans prove most distinctive. An adult strix weighs around 170 pounds. Most strix live to be about 40 years old, with the eldest reaching ages of up to 60. Strix speak their own language, a strange pidgin of Azlanti and Infernal understandable only by those who speak both languages or Strix. Ecology A mysterious, secretive race of winged humanoids, the isolationist strix are set apart from their human neighbors by several subtle differences. The eyes of strix prove particularly interesting, as they are both highly reflective-leading mtales to claim the natives of Devil's Perch possess glowing eyes-and fixed within their owners' heads, forcing strix to rotate their necks to adjust their field of vision. This causes most strix to appear either stiff and somber or jerky and skittish in their rare dealings with other creatures. Strix also possess slightly clawed hands and feet, which aid them in gripping perches but are too delicate to be used as weapons. Habitat & Society The only known strix in Avistan occupy a single group of tall, rocky spires in western Cheliax, communally known as Devil's Perch. From their largest settlement atop the spire of Ciricskree, they hunt the surrounding land by night and guard their territories against the slightest incursion, especially those made by humans. Strix have learned to hate humans, and teach their young from an early age to fear and mistrust them above all other races. Although the source of this hatred proves unclear to all but the strix, it most likely comes from centuries of bloody invasions into their lands, disastrous first encounters, or an even older grudge. Strix culture is tightly knit, as it must be in a society numbering less than a thousand members. Children are cherished and deaths are serious and ceremonious occasions. Murder is unknown among the strix, except when those of their kind are slain by outsiders. The strix take a vicious eye for an eye stance when it comes to retaliation. They also realize that they are small compared to the human nation that-as they see it-besieges them, and view the death of one of their number as proportionally equaling dozens, even hundreds, of outsiders. Suspecting that the cultures of land dwellers prove as tightly knit as their own, the strix might strike against and destroy an entire ship or caravan that comes near their land, avenging themselves against victims who have done no wrong. Their ways are often bloody, but they are not merciless, and what they do, they do only to survive. Lost Origins of the Strix Few who know of the strix believe them to be natives of Avistan's shores. Although such tales are never told to outsiders, even the legends held by the strix of Devil Perch cast doubt on their origins. Rather, ancient tales passed down through their oral tradition tell of a green storm that carried the vicious and undeserving far from their homes, where they and their children would be punished until the sun ceased to rise in the skies. Then came the time when the sun did cease to rise, and the ancestors of the strix were freed from their torment. Lost and alone in a world of darkness, they hunted like beasts for untold years until those few of their race's survivors came to a fortress of stone, where the fish of the sea were plentiful and the terrors of the earth could not reach. There they made their home, and there they have stayed-the inheritors of a forgotten exile-for thousands of years. Aside from these legends, little remains among the strix connecting them to a greater past, though all among those of Devil's Perch harbor the belief that their people are cursed and bear the shame of misdeeds of which none among them know the truth. The great library of Iadara in Kyonin, however, bears faded and ancient scrolls of a strange leather. Said to have been saved from before the Age of Darkness, these man-sized rolls show both black and gray figures bearing great wings and mysterious masks sitting among the men of Azlant and the elves of the lost elven fortress of Adarshavir. Only a handful of elven scholars have made the supposition that the tales of winged devils in western Cheliax and this ancient scrollwork might bear some connection. Strix as Characters Strix are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All strix have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma: Strix are swift and elusive, but their fearsome appearances and insular nature make them difficult to interact with.

Charon, charonadaemons, and various demon lords often employ these monsters as guards. A Stygian turtle-shark normally begins combat using its Power Attack feat.

Stygira,7,monstrous humanoid,temperate hills or underground,"Gaunt and parched, this crone-like figure moves with the predatory jerkiness of a hunting vulture. Unnaturally tall and lean, her form is all cracked flesh and stony crevices spanning a wasteland of withered gray flesh. Shattered black teeth jut from a chapped, lipless mouth that stretches beneath a high, scarred brow devoid of nose or eyes.","Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In ma savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless skies with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented. Habitat & Society Stygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires' powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad scrawls covering mof these hags' lairs.",3200

A stymphalian bird attacks from the air by releasing a volley of bronze feathers at its opponents. It then swoops down and attacks with its beak and wings, flying out of range before its opponents can react. On the ground, a stymphalian bird slashes with its wings and stabs with its beak.

From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Mtales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean. Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or deserts-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the skies, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watersing holes, rivers, and coastlines cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or waters so near to the dangerous birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.",2400

Sudoth,3,aberration,temperate or warm waters,This vaguely humanoid creature has a head that resembles a large jelly fish. Extending down from its large head is a manlike torso and arms that again change into a long knot of feathery writhing tentacles which it uses as a means of propulsion beneath the waves. Its lower torso is a mass of writhing and twitching tentacles.,"Sudoth are a curious species thought to be the offspring of sailors stranded in windless seas and some cursed horror of the deep. For this reason they are often attacked by mariners on sight. In truth, the sudoth are a peaceable if dangerous species that trade freely between locathah, sahaugin, and occasionally sea elves and merfolk. Their pliable flesh proves immune to the pressures of deep waters, allowing them to salvage riches from the depths that even other races of the seas find impossible to retrieve. They are enemies of krakens and aboleth who find them a delicious tasting delicacy. Sudoths make their lairs deep under the oceans and sustain themselves on a diet of small fish and plant life. Hunters by nature, they often employ spears and nets when on a hunting excursion. The fleshy parts of this creature vary in color from a milky white transparent color to a deep, rich bluish-green. Its tentacles range in color from gray to dark blue and vary in size with the sudoth . A small almost unnoticeable band of eyes  ring the circumference of its head. Sudoth attack with weapons such as spears or with slam attacks. Their tail tentacles excrete a paralytic substance. A common tactic is to grapple and paralyze a foe with its tentacles, and finish them off with stabs from their spear. Its malleable form protects it against most bludgeoning attacks; thus opponents are advised to employ piercing or slashing weapons when combating a sudoth. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Suijin,14,outsider,waters,"This massive, serpentine carp explodes forth from the waters, its rainbow-colored scales gleaming in the sunlight and glossy eyes bright with good-natured intelligence.","Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as benevolent and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the flow of its waters' currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are fluid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the vicious oni. In its true form, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of waters that are proportionate to the kami's size and power. Ecology A suijin's particular ward is usually a good indicator of its temperament. A suijin residing in a secluded and placid mountains lakes is often more calm and forgiving of trespasses than one dwelling in the heart of a turbulent rivers, and though all suijins typically mean well, those with more tumultuous wards are generally less tolerant of intruders within their domains. For instance, a suijin protecting a natural whirlpool within a larger body of waters may not help a passing boat of traders that happens to start sinking into its depths, viewing the ship as a disturbance to the forces of nature. Those suijins who are used to seeing their watersways casually abused by the forces of civilization-as almost all cities in some way impose upon or corrupt the rivers and streams that flow near them, and even farming communities may pollute with manure and runoff- can be much more hard-hearted. Suijins in isolated areas care far less about the mortal world than those who interact with it on a daily basis, so the attitude of a suijin dwelling within a mountains stream is often far different than that of one residing in a regularly visited pond. Travelers can earn the approval of a suijin by placing minerals or gemstones within its ward, and those who pollute the waters or use it for evil  are quick to encounter a normally calm suijin's fearsome wrath. Unusual floods and droughts are both signs of a suijin's displeasure with a nearby development's effects on the surrounding waters, and wary villagers are careful to appease a suijin and change their destructive ways, lest they feel the full brunt of the powerful waters kami's righteous wrath. Those suijins who continually fail to protect their waters from troublesome residents or visitors are often quick to fall out of favor with their kindred, and the wards of these kami often become treacherous during the time in which a corrupted suijin makes its gradual transition toward becoming an oni. Habitat & Society A suijin can occupy virtually body of waters, whether it be a stream up to several dozen miles long or a lakes no more than a single mile in diameter. A particularly social suijin might choose to occupy the aqueduct of an urban development if the inhabitants are especially conscious of their impact on the surrounding environs, and such settlements recognize and appreciate the blessing of the benevolent resident, as a suijin cleans and purifies the waters it inhabits. Suijins are solitary kami, and rarely go out of their way to band with others of their kind, preferring instead to protect isolated bodies of waters. This form of aloofness isn't out of fear of or apathy for other kami; instead, suijins merely adhere to a loosely established territorial pact, knowing that their powers are more valuable when spread throughout regions, rather than concentrated on particular bodies of waters. When suijins do interact with one another, they do so at points where two bodies of waters meet, such as estuaries and deltas. If two connecting bodies of waters are especially healthy and the suijins residing in them are entirely undisturbed by forces of corruption, it is said that the waters kami celebrate nature in a sort of bonding ritual. The rare event can be seen as motes of blue and green light whirling in the shallows of the adjoining waters, and scholars speculate that this event may symbolize the creation of a new suijin.",38400
Suli,0.5,outsider,any,This fine-featured humanoid wears exotic clothing and has flashing eyes; his arms are sheathed in a blaze of crackling flames.,"Sulis  are minor offshoots of the jann that live among humans. They are tall and look like ordinary men and women but for their abnormal beauty and the occasional flash of elemental light in their eyes. Though physically superior to and more attractive than normal humans, some suli-jann remain unaware of their genie heritage until later in life, when contact with a full-blooded genie draws forth a portion of their elemental power. While all sulis can trace their lineage back to a janni ancestor, very few have an immediate janni parent. In most cases, this legacy lies fallow in the blood for generations, only to emerge decades or even centuries later. Those whose powers become apparent early on usually lead troubled lives as youths, as the question of a child's origins tears some families apart; few of these unfortunate sulis grow up knowing anything of the peace of a happy home. Sulis age at the same rate as humans and are physically identical to humans in terms of height and weight. During their youth, sulis tend to be slightly smaller than their fully human peers, but grow quickly to their full adult height upon reaching their teenage years. Sulis are impulsive and passionate by nature, and even those sulis who know nothing of their genie blood possess a measure of personal pride. SULI CHARACTERS Sulis are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Suspiridaemon,7,outsider,any,"This tall, three-legged fiend possesses an avian body and head, save for its gangly arms, which end in thin, clawlike fingers. Its scrawny neck is adorned with three thick iron rings, and a grotesquely long, barbed tongue resembling an octopus's tentacle winds out of its oversized beak. Burst blood vessels fill the creature's wide eyes, and reddish speckled blotches cover its cyanotic flesh.","Horrid fiends whose very presence makes the air difficult to breathe, suspiridaemons personify death by suffocation. Discolored and blotched like the stagnant blood of a suffocated corpse, a suspiridaemon enjoys nothing more than the last choked gasp of a victim as it wraps its tongue around the creature's throat. While a suspiridaemon does not normally breathe, its body is nonetheless convulsive and twitchy; coupled with its utterly silent demeanor, they excel at slow, gruesome kills while hiding in the shadows. The only time a suspiridaemon makes a noticeable noise is when it suddenly loosens the binds around its neck and inhales a booming breath, the sudden loss of air enough to make foes fall ill. Ecology A suspiridaemon arises from an evil soul that died by suffocation, drowning, or execution by hanging. Each individual suspiridaemon bears the mark of its particular manner of mortal death-usually in the form of the bruised or mangled flesh of its throat-and the large iron collars around its neck hide such shameful reminders of life, though the suspiridaemon itself is often unaware of this. A suspiridaemon comes into being with the rings already bound around its throat, so that it never witnesses the aff lictions that sent it to Abaddon in the first place. It is thought that should the collars around a suspiridaemon's throat ever be broken, the fiend's head would crook clumsily downward, allowing the monster to see wounds that might remind it of the terrible death it endured in its past existence. Suspiridaemons pride themselves on the number of souls they have deprived of life by strangulation, and this amount often corresponds to the number of iron rings a suspiridaemon wears on its body. While most suspiridaemons are relatively weak compared to their daemonic kin, a particularly skillful individual who is talented at crafting as well as killing can construct iron collars adorned with gem slots, items that give the suspiridaemon the ability to contain the souls of its victims in the rings for trade in the soul markets of Abaddon. When a suspiridaemon is slain, its iron rings disintegrate into ash, and gems held within are shattered as well, freeing the trapped souls. A suspiridaemon generally uses stealth when confronting foes. Unleashing its long, winding tongue from a dark corner, one of these fiends will strangle an unwary foe in isolation from the rest of the creature's party. When in combat, a suspiridaemon greatly prefers to kill its enemies by its own hands or its barbed tongue, using its arcane abilities and other daemonic gifts to wear down or sow discord into a group of opponents. To a suspiridaemon, there is no act more appreciable than choking the life from a victim, and bringing the creature close to hear its final, distorted gasp. A suspiridaemon prefers to take souls from creatures who are on the verge of death, but aren't quite there yet; the fiend gazes at its victim's expiring face, drawing the dying creature's soul out of it with a solemn suspension of the daemon's normal twitching and convulsing. Those who have witnessed a suspiridaemon draw the life from a creature claim that the fiend almost seems to be inhaling fresh air for the first time as the victim's physical shell expires, and for the briefest moment, the monster appears to breathe normally. The eerie spectacle ends as quickly as it begins, however, as the suspiridaemon sets its gaze upon its next victim, preparing its vicious tongue for another attack. Habitat & Society While mdaemons dedicate their loyalty to one of the Horsemen or some other power within Abaddon, either based on their origins, historical ties, or environmental circumstances, no such proclivities exist for suspiridaemons. Suspiridaemons avoid operating under masters whenever possible, preferring more individualistic careers of murder and destruction. They tend to work well with other daemons when forced into doing so, though the more daring individuals tend to stray from Abaddon and gravitate toward population centers on other planes to stalk prey as they please. Suspiridaemons traversing the multiverse in a pack regularly take their small hunting parties into the wilderness around smaller settlements, ravenous in their pursuit of those who stray from the protective gazes of allies. While their killing tactics are as ruthless as other daemon, suspiridaemons' murders are particularly shrouded in a cold manner of sincere and solemn contemplation, their grisly crimes against souls veiled in a mist of contempt toward the living as well as hatred for themselves. Some speculate that this self-hatred might be connected to the lingering doubts as to their origins, the itch beneath their iron collars that reminds them of their own past mortality. Whatever the cause of their self-doubt, the feeling does not seem to bother most other daemons, who generally view suspiridaemons as useful companions whether inside or outside of Abaddon. Piscodaemons and sangudaemons in particular consider them among the most ideal lesser daemons to command. Suspiridaemons cannot speak, and rarely use their powers of telepathy to communicate, simply nodding discreetly when given a task by a more powerful daemon. This silent subservience only adds to other daemons' general appreciation of their humble and disturbing demeanors, though most are sure to keep the strangling fiends at a distance.",3200

Their overdeveloped pectoral fins and widely separated dorsal fins make them swift swimmers, and their powerful jaws promise a quick and brutal death for prey they might catch. Their tails serve as potent secondary weapons, which they use to bludgeon particularly hardy opponents before tearing them limb from limb. swamps barracuda thrive in the tropical waters surrounding the continent of Garund, and are particularly prominent throughout the Sodden Lands and Mwangi Expanse. To the north, they can occasionally be found in the Mushfens and the Varisian Gulf in the warmer months, heading south when winter cools the waters. While they normally hunt alone or in small groups, during their migratory season, massive schools of swamps barracuda can be spotted traveling down the western Avistani coastlines, where they feed on small whales as well as terrestrial creatures that wander too close to their waters. While swamps barracuda are most often found in the wild, particularly daring hunters sometimes capture them to serve either as food or pets. swamps barracuda can survive for a long time outside their preferred climates, but often grow lax and weak if their owners fail to feed them properly or don't take care of their holding tank. Magnimar's infamous Sczarni gang, the Gallowed, uses swamps barracuda as a coercion technique against wealthy patsies as well as borrowers who fail to make a payment on time . Called the Fish Tank by those who know of it, the saltwaters aquarium that houses Jaster Frallino's precious barracuda is stored in a dilapidated blue caravan wagon owned by the Gallowed, and more than one failed business partner has lost an eye, toe, or hand to ""the Boss's Fish."" It is also known that the Sczarni boss keeps a collection of rusty keys at the bottom of the Fish Tank, though the purpose of these mysterious items is a secret held by Frallino alone.

Tabaxis can still employ their bite as a secondary attack if using a weapon, as well as one claw as an offhand attack if the hand is free, but they cannot use their grab or rake abilities while doing so. A typical tabaxi stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. Tabaxi Society Tabaxis live in small groups called prides deep in jungles and warm forests. A typical pride consists of 1-3 each of males, females, and young. The females tend to be slightly larger than the males, and typically are the dominant members of a pride. They live a nomadic lifestyle, prowling through their chosen range and hunting in groups of three to five. They carry little in the way of possessions, although they often sport a miscellaneous array of weapons wrested from past prey. Unless hungry most tabaxi prides leave other intelligent creatures alone, though they may attack if intruders in their range bear especially interesting-looking weaponry.

Taer,2,monstrous humanoid,cold mountains,"This hulking shaggy brute has a large sloping head, icy blue eyes, and an ape-like appearance. Its body is covered in thick snow-white fur and its hands end in powerful fists.","Taer are shaggy, primitive, naked humanoids that may be related to the yeti. They resemble prehistoric humans but are more bestial and apelike. Their fur is coated with an oily, fatty substance excreted through the pores, which protects them from cold. Taer can see clearly even in heavy snowstorms due to a second transparent eyelid that protects the eye from blowing winds and heavy snow. Taer never wear clothing, although they do sometimes wear necklaces and bracelets of tooth and horn. Taer do not have a formal language as such; they communicate with one another through grunts, hooting, and yelling, as well as a body language similar to that of apes. Taer attack with their fists and bite, but occasionally use stone spears in combat. They are fierce creatures and very territorial, attacking living creature that wanders into the area. Taer use their knowledge of the land to their advantage during combat by creating avalanches, burrowing under snow and attacking from surprise, and using snow-covered pits to trap their prey. They prefer to drive intruders off rather than kill them. Taer Society Taers are nomadic creatures that band together in clans for protection, hunting, and social reasons. During the day, adults hunt for food, which consists of fruits, berries, nuts, insects, and game . Though they do eat meat, taer do not hunt or eat humans or humanoids. Taer are extremely superstitious and fear metal and clothing and those that use and wear them. No taer ever wields or wears items of cloth or metal. Taer clans worship a snow-god to whom they offer sacrifices for protection and guidance. Each clan has a large stone idol of this snow god that is often located in the very heart of the clan or near the clan leader's cave. Taer Characters Taer characters possess the following racial traits. +6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma. Cold Subtype: This grants taer immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire. Darkvision: Taer can see in the dark out to a range of 60 ft. Aura: Stench .

Taiga Giant,12,humanoid,cold mountains or forests,"This muscular giant has dark gray skin and fiery red hair. Its lower jaw bears sharp fangs, and it wields a huge, primitive spear.","Taiga giants wander endlessly to keep from depleting the food supply of one area. Aurochs and mammoths are their preferred inland prey, while whales, seals, and walruses provide food in coastlines regions. These animals form the cornerstone of tribal survival, not just for the food they provide but because nearly all of a tribe's possessions, from their portable shelters to their weapons, are crafted from the bone, hides, and sinews of felled beasts. Little is wasted. Taiga giants are also deeply spiritual, worshiping their ancestors. Every tribe member learns to call forth ancestor spirits at a young age. Taiga giants are ashamed of being the ancestors of rune giants as, like most giants, they both hate and fear rune giants as slavers and monsters. A typical taiga giant stands 20 feet in height and weighs 10,000 pounds. Skin tones vary from dark to pale gray, with hair color ranging from dark brown to red.",19200
Taiga Linnorm,19,dragon,cold forests,"With menacing black horns jutting from its head, this two-legged dragon is covered in dark green scales and vicious black barbs.","A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm is a terror to all those who venture through the arctic forests of the north. Taiga linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their victims off with their devastating bite. In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days- sometimes weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs. In event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack outlying villages. A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over 13,000 pounds.",204800

Tangtal,3,magical beast,temperate forests or plains,"Small white flecks cover its head, throat and neck, and shoulders, and its long, upward curving tail ends with a white tip. It stands on muscular legs with huge paws with sharpened claws.","Tangtals, or dupli-cats, are ferocious and intelligent panthers with the ability to produce illusory images of themselves. They roam haunted woodlands or plains and often lair near civilized areas. Tangtals are solitary creatures; no recorded encounter has ever placed more than one of these creatures together. Mating season is the only time more than one of these creatures is likely to be encountered and sages have argued as to exactly when tangtals mate. Tangtal young are unknown and none have ever been seen. Tangtals are carnivores and prefer to dine on small animals such as rats, moles, squirrels, and so on. In such instances when food is scarce, it is not unheard of for a tangtal to sneak into a civilized area and carry off or kill chickens, hens, dogs, cats, and even small children. A tangtal is about 7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs about 350 to 400 pounds. Tangtals wait for prey to come within range before leaping to attack with their wicked bite and sharpened claws. They use their duplicate ability as a defense mechanism against larger or stronger foes, or when they're outnumbered. Tangtals are smart enough to know when the day is lost, and if combat goes against them, they flee. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800
Tanuki,4,monstrous humanoid,temperate forests or urban,"Short and pudgy, this raccoonlike humanoid wields a stout quarterstaff and weaves a little as if intoxicated.","Jolly tricksters, tanukis love deceiving humanoids and other intelligent creatures. This mischief is usually harmless, but can turn spiteful in some situations. Popular folklore stories claim tanukis are the transformed souls of tools and housewares that were used for more than 100 years, a myth that probably results from tanukis' ability to magically create or alter objects. Mostly encountered in disguise, tanukis enjoy visiting humanoid settlements and interacting with the people. They usually visit taverns and eateries, joining in feasts and celebrations whenever possible. Tanukis always change their disguises and rarely visit the same town twice in the same month. Tanuki mischief becomes spiteful to those who defile nature. Hunters who kill for sport or those who log trees from the forests without seeding new ones find their weapons and tools transformed into bowls and teacups. Tanukis also put more effort into their pranks when the target is a braggart, a bully, or someone of poor moral character. They like to prank brooding types as well, always hoping to bring a smile to the hard faces of such dour folk. Because of their trickster nature, tanukis get along with mfey creatures. Some tanukis even deal well with spirits, often helping them pass from this world. Though rare, violent and morbid tanukis occasionally walk the lands, bringing suffering to those they encounter. Filled with spite, these evil tanukis pull sadistic pranks, and horror stories tell of tanukis killing old women and tricking their husbands into eating soups made from their flesh. A tanuki is 5 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.",1200
Taotieh,11,construct,any,"This white marble statue resembles a large feline, but its body and face are covered in decorative etchings and runes.","Symbols of power but also of gluttony, taotiehs are guardian constructs formed of stone and built around a pocket of extradimensional space. Taotiehs are used to ward sacred or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their semblance to tigers extends even to the animal's abilities in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks. The extradimensional space at the core of a taotieh allows the construct to swallow opponents of its own size and then shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A creature capable of existing without air could well spend an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn't smash its way out or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must wait for outside forces to slay its captor.

Tarry Demodand,13,outsider,any,"This lithe, toothy creature's jet-black skin looks like living tar, and ooze drips from the claws that cap its long arms.","Tarry demodands are lithe and lean compared to other demodands. Despite this difference, all tarry demodands are strong and agile. Although their batlike wings appear tattered and useless, they can still fly. A tarry demodand stands 7 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. The tarry demodand is the grunt of the demodand army-bred for battle, these swift and deadly demodands make up the bulk of demodand legion. That they themselves are more powerful than most outsiders is as much a testament to their race as anything else-a single tarry demodand is a formidable opponent, to say nothing of a group of the creatures. Although tarry demodands are quite strong, they prefer using light weapons-one in each hand. Tarry demodands only rarely use larger weaponry, and then only when directly ordered by a superior. They lack the terrific claws of the greater demodands, and a tarry demodand with no weapons tends to flee combat as soon as possible, only to return when it is properly armed.",25600

They are philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of the rakshasa immortals. Their familiarity with religion and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors and blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites or rituals directly so as to foil good works and slay holy people. A tataka holds all religions in contempt save the worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and assaults who dare believe otherwise. Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and they train from an early age in martial arts-their strikes can break bones as surely as unarmed strike from a monk or other practitioner of such styles of combat.

Tatzlwyrm,2,dragon,forests,This serpentine creature has the head of a ferocious dragon and two relatively small forearms that end in tiny claws.,"Tatzlwyrms are thought to be primeval relatives of true dragons, having branched off the line millennia ago and evolved in a way that sets them notably apart. Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are nonetheless ferocious in their own right. And while tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives, most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally. They understand Draconic, though other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension. Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and rudimentary traps. Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and possess a weak poisonous breath similar to the breath weapons of their true dragon relatives. An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding, organless tail, and it weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouf lage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray. Like true dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack prey that ventures too near. They consume their food slowly in the dark security and seclusion of their lairs. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouf lage.",600
Tazelwurm,5,magical beast,mountains,"The emergent creature looks like a long serpent with grayish scales and a leonine head resembling female lion with grayish-tan fur. Two long, powerful humanoid arms protrude from its serpentine body, each ending in vicious-looking, slender talons.","A tazelwurm is an aggressive, flesh-eating monster with a serpentine body, feline head, and two long powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws. They haunt mountains passes and prey on travelers passing through their territory. Tazelwurms are masters of camouflage and are nearly indistinct from their rocky surroundings. They enjoy striking from ambush and downing unsuspecting prey. They are diurnal hunters and are most active in the morning hours. Their hunting grounds often cover several square miles of rocky terrain and should a tazelwurm enter another's territory, it is quickly driven away if detected. Tazelwurms eat just about anything that comes near, but they are especially fond of mountains lions and mountains goats. When the tazelwurm kills its prey, it drags it to its lair which takes the form of a well-hidden and nearly inaccessible depression or cave. The kill is devoured over a period of several days. Tazelwurms rarely interact with other creatures; including their own kind. When more than one is encountered, they are usually a mated pair. Young are born live and left to the care of the mother. Young tazelwurms reach maturity around two years of age and leave the lair to go out on their own. Very old tazelwurms may even have lichens and mosses growing on them, enhancing their rocky appearances. A tazelwurm lies in wait for its meals. Using its tremorsense ability, it senses vibrations in the rocks where it hides and springs to attack when prey draws near. Tazelwurms generally avoid large groups of travelers, preferring to attack a straggler or a member of a party that happens to have gotten lost or separated. A hungry tazelwurm though, will attack just about anything that comes near it. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1600

Temerdaemon,14,outsider,any,"This creature lurches forward on multiple arms and legs, its spine contorted into a painful curve with its hips higher than it head. Seemingly distracted and muttering to itself, the thing rarely looks up with its glowing red eyes, its hair composed of hundreds of thin, white tendrils that hang over its head like a veil. Strapped onto the creature's body at various points are sacks and belt pouches stuffed with bizarre collections of objects, and its rear arms wield a wide, black bladed scythe, still coated with the blood of the fiend's last victim.","Temerdaemons personify the concept of accidental death. A knight falls upon her sword, a peasant trips and breaks his neck, a structure fails in ways its builders never foresaw and buries dozens of innocents, and meanwhile, a distant temerdaemon cackles knowingly. While true accidents please the fiend, it also delights in engineering the mishaps itself, crafting incomprehensibly complex plots that lead to the slaughter of as mmortals as possible. A temerdaemon often wades into the aftermath of such engineered catastrophes, carving apart the crippled survivors and sowing mass confusion and hysteria by its very proximity. A gangly mass consisting of a rotund torso, four arms, and four legs, the average temerdaemon is 10 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds, not counting its bizarre collection of mechanical fetishes and tinkering equipment. Ecology Lesser fiends who follow in an existing temerdaemon's wake and learn from the daemon's actions are those most typically chosen by one of the Four Horsemen or a member of the daemonic elite for elevation into this terrible caste of crippled giants. Occasionally, however, an evil mortal soul proves worthy of such a station, having died in a singularly horrific accident, especially one engineered by its own hands. In such cases, transition from soul to temerdaemon is swift-on a cosmic scale-and made even swifter by a proclivity to prey upon other mortals. Though Zyphus-the god of accidental deaths and tragedies-is thought by some to be the conceptual father of temerdaemons, the Grim Harvestman has never outright claimed responsibility for them. Nonetheless, he frequently delights in temerdaemons and the infrequent unconsumed souls they send his way. Neither Zyphus nor the temerdaemons seek to disrupt the other's claim over particular souls; they find the destinations of such tragically doomed mortals frequently cross paths, and are as likely to end up in the hands of daemons as the god's minions. Cultists of Zyphus often revel in the doings of temerdaemons, though the daemons themselves despise such worship by the very mortals they seek to destroy. Even slaying these foolish accident-worshipers is hardly enough for the angry temerdaemons, as the daemons' masterfully constructed accidents are wasted on those who actually hope for the horrid events. According to temerdaemons, freak accidents are best engineered for those who go about life with little concern for danger, especially those who least expect such misfortune to befall them. People who watch their backs-including paranoids and betrayers-don't satisfy the morbid desires of temerdaemons as much as the daydreaming child or absent-minded village idiot. No two temerdaemons look exactly the same, as these treacherous beings take on as mforms as there are ways to freakishly die. Particularly powerful individuals may rise to enormous sizes, possessing dozens of legs and arms, as well as multiple heads, all of which strive to wreak as much disaster as possible upon the souls around them. Habitat & Society Temerdaemons wander the multiverse in search of opportunities for sabotage and treachery. Those cultists of Zyphus foolish enough to summon the daemons in hopes of bargaining with them for their services often find themselves victims of their own elaborate rituals. In their most fortunate cases, a temerdaemon arises on the Material Plane only to greet its summoners with its wicked smile and deadly aura, causing chandeliers to fall upon unwary victims' heads, robed priests to trip onto sharp candelabras, and sconces to break off of walls and ignite dusty curtains to set an entire building on fire. Now on the Material Plane, its summoners dead, a temerdaemon strives to create as much havoc and mischief as possible before being banished to its home in Abaddon. If it weren't for the extravagant and terrif ically tragic manner of his worshipers' deaths, Zyphus might be rather displeased with the actions of these cunning daemons, but as it stands, there is rarely conf lict between the two forces, which inadvertently share similar goals. Temerdaemons rarely cooperate among themselves when crafting masterful hazards, preferring to enact their deadly accidents on their own and later boast to their kindred of their massacres. No two accidents are alike, and though temerdaemons sometimes gather in groups of two or three for particularly elaborate schemes, they have no reason to share their techniques or formulate plans for long, as premeditating a particular slaughter is entirely counterproductive in the eyes of a temerdaemon. To these improvisational fiends, an accidental murder is even more satisfying than a mere accidental death. Despite their preference to act alone, temerdaemons at times happily utilize some of their lesser kindred as unwitting cogs in their disastrous plans. Particular among these pawns are the miniscule cacodaemons, which frequently cluster in numbers of up to a dozen around a given temerdaemon, ready to absorb and regurgitate the souls of their greater kindred's kills. When a temerdaemon cannot attract cacodaemon followers, it simply captures them, and given temerdaemon of considerable power can often be found with dozens of these least daemons impaled on barbed hooks, stuffed into tightly drawn satchels, or crammed into small cages, each container dangling from its myriad straps, belts, and holsters.",38400
Tempest Behemoth,22,magical beast,air,"Three pairs of wings beat rhythmically, churning up hurricane-force winds around this vast, birdlike monstrosity.","Riding the winds on a triple set of wings, tempest behemoths fly above all, death riding in their shadows. In battle, they snatch up foes only to cast them away from great heights, smash enemies with their wings, or hurl razor-edged scales at distant targets. A tempest behemoth's divine heritage wards its body, mind, and soul against harm. Only the most powerful magic or attack can pierce its defenses. Serene in their immortality, tempest behemoths fear no other being. As living forces of divine retribution, tempest behemoths are sent forth into the world to raze far-f lung cities, ravage towns with mighty storms, level remote mountains temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable from the ground. The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally presaged by foul weather and terrific storms that drive flocks of birds before their headwinds.

Temporal Crawler,6,magical beast,Elemental Plane of Time,"A six-foot long hairy, gray spider crawls forth. An hourglass-shaped patch of silver fur dominates its back. Light bounces of its silverymetallic mandibles while its multiple eyes glow bright red.","Temporal crawlers are man-sized spiders from the Elemental Plane of Time. Upon close inspection, it appears that the hourglass-shaped markings along its back are animated and sand appears to shift from one chamber to the other. If a temporal crawler is slain, the silver hourglass on its back fades to gray and the ""sand"" inside stops flowing. How temporal crawlers first arrived on the Material Plane is unknown but sages believe they jumped through a portal to this plane opened by a time elemental or time flayer . These extraplanar creatures are carnivorous and prey on the flesh of living creatures. They build their lairs near populated areas where the food supply is more than adequate. Temporal crawlers hunt day or night, but prefer to leave their webs at night when they have an easier time corralling their prey. Temporal crawlers spend most of their time hunting on the Material Plane where prey is easiest to catch. They spin their webs in locations frequented by living creatures and lie in wait. When its prey enters a 10- foot area around its webs and is slowed, the temporal crawler rushes out and attacks. If it can paralyze its prey with its bite, the temporal crawler cocoons it in its web. A creature killed is cocooned and stored as food. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",2400
Tendriculos,6,plant,temperate or warm forests,"This plant's thick trunk is capped by a crown of wide leaves, whipping vines, mushrooms, and a ravenous purple maw.","A tendriculos is a creature brought into being through a corruption of nature, often where foul magic has seeped into the environs for myears, or where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the mysterious realm of the fey have worn thin. Tales and myths speak of arcane manipulation from other planes, while others speak of a tendriculos as being the manifestation of an angered spirit of nature. A voracious carnivore, the tendriculos is an active hunter when it needs to be but it prefers to rely on ambush tactics, choosing welltraveled areas in the forests where it can lie in wait in the undergrowth. The creature is quick to swallow prey it happens to catch in its vines, relying upon the acidfilled reservoir in its trunk to finish off prey that may still have a bit of fight left in it. This acid not only consumes organic material with shocking ease, but also contains a powerful paralytic enzyme that further reduces a creature's chance of escape once it's been gulped down by the plant. Although incapable of speech itself, the tendriculos generally understands a handful of words in a single language . While they tend to see all smaller creatures as nothing more than food, tales exist of certain creatures, particularly fey or druids, having secured a sort of alliance with local tendriculoses. In such cases, the tendriculos is more than willing to serve its ally as a guardian, so long as the ally is diligent at providing the plant with a regular supply of food. The fact that a tendriculos displays a curious mix of plant, fungal, and even animal traits  has long intrigued sages. That the creature is a plant is firmly established, yet it lays egg-like spheres when the need to reproduce strikes. These ""eggs"" are in fact massive, puff ball-like fungi filled with spores-when jostled, the cloud of spores that is released can carry for miles, ensuring that a single tendriculos can seed a huge territory. A tendriculos is 20 feet tall and weighs 3,500 pounds.",2400
Tendrul,7,aberration,temperate or warm waters,"The size of a small whale, this amphibious creature has a pair of powerful flippers with which it pulls itself from the waters to sun itself on the stones. It has a head reminiscent of a piranha, the body of a giant grayish-black seal, and a bony razor-sharp scythe-like tail.","The tendrul is a horror of the semi- and subtropical shallows, often attacking fishermen who wade out into the shallows with their nets, or wander out to search their crab traps. A tendrul makes its home in the shallows of the waters, sleeping in underwaters caves or between rocks. During the daylight hours on warmer days, it is not uncommon to see a tendrul sunning itself on the rocks or sands. Though it can survive indefinitely on land, a tendrul prefers the sanctity of its watersy home, leaving the waters only to sun on the rocks or feed on some unlucky fisherman or creature that has wandered too close to the shoreline. A tendrul looks like a hideous cross between a seal and piranha. An average tendrul reaches 12 feet long and weighs several hundred pounds. Its body is grayish-black with it being lighter on its underbelly and a bit darker on the head. Its trunk tapers off into a thin, scythe-like tail of hardened bone, dark gray in color. Its piranha-like head sports a gaping maw filled with razor-sharp dagger-sized teeth of grayish-yellow. A tendrul sustains itself on fish, waters life, and oceansic plants in the waters, but prefers a diet of flesh from land-bound creatures. It especially savors the flesh of humans and goblins. A tendrul's favorite tactic is to bury itself in the silt and sand of the shoreline and wait for a fisherman to wander over its hiding place where it rises up from beneath its prey, biting it, and devouring it on the spot. Amphibious, it is not uncommon for a tendrul to chase wounded prey some distance onto the shore to finish it off. Another favored tactic a tendrul employs is to grab prey in its mouth, drag it into the waters and pin it underwaters where the tendrul holds it until its prey drowns.

Tenebrous Worm,8,outsider,land,"This pallid beast clatters upon dozens of small legs.

The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing -but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume. Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively palecolored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area  and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell , muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.",4800
Tengu,0.5,humanoid,temperate mountains or urban,"Black feathers cover this crow-headed humanoid, and its hands and legs end in powerful talons.","Tengus are a race of avian humanoids that resemble crows or ravens, and often bear much of the same stigma. Though they frequently choose to live among other races in densely populated cities, their society is tight and closed, and they rarely allow others to see its inner workings. Tengus often band together in small groups to create roosts in vacant warehouses or condemned buildings, and these raucous gathering places are generally assumed to be thieves' guilds by outsiders-an assumption that's correct roughly half the time. Like the crows they share physical traits with, tengus are naturally covetous, especially of shiny or colorful items, and prone to bouts of good-natured kleptomania if they don't carefully keep themselves in check. Vain and prideful creatures, they are easily persuaded with flattery. Tengu Characters Tengus are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All tengus have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom: Tengus are fast and observant, but relatively fragile and delicate. Senses: Tengus have low-light vision. Sneaky: Tengus gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth. Gifted Linguist: See above. Swordtrained: See above. Natural Weapon: Tengus possess a bite natural attack that inflicts 1d3 points of damage on a hit. This is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the tengu wields a manufactured weapon. Languages: Tengus begin play speaking Common and their own dialect of Tengu. Tengus with high Intelligence scores can choose language as a bonus language.",200
Tentacled Horror,10,aberration,underground,Four tentacles emerge from the torso of this massive misshapen creature. Above these are a tooth-encrusted maw and a glaring red eye. At the top of the creature is a glistening black horn.,"Ancient and evil, a tentacled horror is a monstrosity from the unknown depths of the earth. This monster is most often found inhabiting dungeons or ruins far from the reaches of civilization. Tentacled horrors are egotistical and lazy creatures, and put themselves above all others they encounter. Often, a tentacled horror that finds its way into a subterranean society will attempt to set itself up as a god. Lesser creatures such as goblins often accept this false god and bring it sacrifices of living victims. Once ensconced as ruler-deity, a tentacled horror is content to remain in one place to be cared for by its subjects. A tentacled horror that has been in power for some time will be surrounded by a pool of its own slime and the scattered bones of its victims. Exuding a foul oily slime wherever it goes, a tentacled horror has a powerful humanoid torso that ends in a thick slug-like foot. Sprouting from the torso are four whip-like tentacles tipped in cruel barbs. Most horrifying of all, however, is the face. A tentacled horror has a shapeless head with a single, huge, unblinking eye. The mouth of a tentacled horror is a yawning chasm of sharp teeth eager to sink into living flesh. Above the eye is a glistening black 2-foot long horn-the very source of the tentacled horror's power. A tentacled horror attacks first with its tentacles, ripping and tearing at its opponent with the sharp barbs at the tip. Any grappled opponent is immediately bitten.

Tentamort,4,aberration,marshes or underground,This creature has a small spherical body of gray flesh. Two long tentacles protrude from the upper half of the sphere while eight smaller tentacles hang from the bottom of its spherical body. One tentacle ends in a squid-like appendage while the other ends in a needle-like barb.,"Tentamorts are thought to have arrived on the Material Plane through a tear in the planar fabric. They are rarely encountered above ground, preferring the darkness of underground caverns and dungeons. The tentamort somewhat resembles a squid. Its body is a small, 3-foot diameter sphere of gray, hard flesh. Two 10-foot long tentacles protrude from the upper half of its body while eight 2-foot long tentacles hang from its underside . Of the two large tentacles, one is thicker and covered with squid-like suction cups, while the other is leaner, and is tipped with a bone-colored needle-sharp barb. A tentamort uses its small tentacles to crawl along ceilings and walls. When prey passes underneath, it drops on its opponent, grabbing it with its tentacles and injecting it with its deadly acid. If two targets are available within reach, it will direct a separate tentacle at each one, hoping to hold one target in place long enough to paralyze the other, then detach its stinging tentacle and focus both attacks on the remaining prey.

Terra-cotta Soldier,6,construct,any,"This perfectly sculpted, finely detailed, life-sized clay figure has a look of fierce determination and a sword clenched in each hand.","A terra-cotta soldier is crafted from clay and fired into ceramic, and is usually sculpted to resemble an armored human soldier, although terra-cotta soldiers resembling other races, such as hobgoblins, tengus, or even demons and oni, are also common. Terra-cotta soldiers are often created to guard the tomb of powerful rulers, standing in silent ranks to guard their liege even after his or her death. These soldiers stand vigil for centuries, animating only to defend the tomb and its riches from tomb robbers. Terra-cotta soldiers are typically painted with colored lacquer, though this decoration is often worn away from use or faded with age. A terra-cotta soldier stands 6 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Unlike most constructs, a terra-cotta soldier carries within its form a spark of intelligence. This is hardly enough to grant the construct the ability to speak or otherwise engage in free will, but it is enough for it to carry out more complex tactics than most constructs are capable of. It's not unusual for a terra-cotta soldier to possess different feats or use different weapons. Two relatively common variants are summarized below. Terra-Cotta Archer : Terra-cotta archers are simply terra-cotta soldiers outfitted with composite longbows. Terra-cotta archers have Improved Initiative, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Weapon Focus  as feats. Terra-Cotta Horseman : Some terra-cotta soldiers are crafted to resemble warriors mounted on terra-cotta horses, though rider and mount are one creature. Terra-cotta horsemen are Large terra-cotta soldiers with 10 racial Hit Dice and the trample and undersized weapons special abilities. Terra-cotta horsemen are usually outfitted with lances instead of swords, and have Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, and Weapon Focus  as feats.

When it selects an owner, it follows that creature around purring and meowing. If it manages to kill its owner with its energy drain ability, it selects a new owner from the remaining family members .

Tetrolimulus,11,magical beast,temperate coastlines,"From a body like a strange crab sprouts the torso of a praying mantis, clad in coral-colored crustacean armor. Swaying hypnotically, it rattles razor-sharp claws and raises its long, rapier-like tail stinger.","A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act. Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these deadly claws and the creature's other name, the ""beach guillotine,"" for the brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in a mutiny. With somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the ""sea-mantis"" because it resembles a crab's strong legs and shell merged with a mantis' powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion's deadly stinger. The creature's durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain. Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught mmariners off guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice thrown across a table. Its final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus's tail stinger. The stinger is razor sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle spasms and cramps accompa gradual slowing of movement, hinting at oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for easy consumption. One of nature's cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a popular tool of the Red Mantis assassins, who appreciate both the poison's painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor. Ecology Out of the waters, the tetrolimulus adopts an unusual swaying movement of the upper body. Although its purpose is not entirely clear, it is thought that, much like the land-dwelling mantis, the movement enhances the creature's primitive vision and makes picking out prey by its own relative movement easier. It has been suggested that remaining completely still when confronted by a tetrolimulus may prevent detection, but none have been able to confirm the success of this tactic, and there are none who are confident enough of the theory to test it in the field. Female tetrolimuluses, the hunters of the species, are by far the more aggressive. Rarely seen, males live in deeper waters as bottom feeders, emerging only in the mating season in early spring. At this time for a few days each year, both sexes make great journeys, sometimes of hundreds of miles, to return to ancient coastlines breeding grounds. Here dominant and aggressive females meet and mate with the strongest of the smaller and more delicate males. Only a small number of these males get a chance to breed, and an even smaller number survive to return to the oceans. The energy and effort of their travels exhaust the females, and once they've been impregnated, the easiest and closest source of food is the weaker males surrounding them. A fertilized female may even continue to exhibit signs of availability to encourage more males to approach her- not for reproduction, but to satisfy her more immediate hunger. Young are born at sea, and perhaps as payment for their strength and power later in life, they spend their first few months at the bottom of the food chain. Without the thick shells of maturity, they are easy prey, which contributes a great deal to population control of their species. As their shells thicken and harden, they start to enjoy a less harried existence, and by 6 months old they start to fight back. They reach maturity in 12 to 18 months and can live for up to 50 years. Tetrolimuluses' behavior is largely instinct-driven, but during the breeding season the normally nomadic creatures will fight viciously to protect the shores of their ancestral breeding grounds. Even male sea-mantises rise to combat, though at sea they more commonly flee than risk confrontation. Females can be found in the area of the Abendego Gulf, from Mediogalti Island all the way into the Shackles and as far north as the Sodden Lands. Even Rahadoum has seen the occasional tetrolimulus washed ashore to the south, where the creatures are feared as the twisted manifestations of Achaekek, conjured for worship by the Red Mantis and a stark reminder of the folly of religious devotion. There are descriptions of creatures similar to the tetrolimulus to the north, even into the Inner Sea, but these stories are as old and leaky as the ships of the pirates and traders who tell them and no reports of tetrolimuluses along the cost of Cheliax, for example, are younger than two generations. Much of tetrolimuluses' bulk is armor, and despite their size they can survive on relatively small quantities of food. In perhaps the only mark of intelligence in their species, they try to avoid overfishing, instead roaming over several miles of coastlines to balance their Ecology. The majority of their diet is fish and cephalopods, but they are competent trackers and follow hints of habitation on their beaches to devour coast-dwelling mammals foolish enough to find themselves on the beaches, including humanoids. Like most animals, tetrolimuluses tend to avoid large settlements or areas frequently visited by humans. Remote or inaccessible beaches are the females' preferred habitat, but occasionally a powerful storm rolling out of the Eye of Abendego can toss them on more popular or even populous coastlines. Surprisingly high concentrations of the creatures are found around Mediogalti Island and its outlying cluster. Some suggest this is due to deliberate cultivation by the Red Mantis, thanks to the tetrolimulus's favorable form, but it may simply be because the treacherous waters and hidden coves are perfect for their reclusive lifestyle, and the frequent mutinies, shipwrecks, and foolish adventurers provide a varied and ample diet for the brutal predators. Tetrodotoxin While none are stupid enough to actively farm sea-mantises, occasionally the corpse of one is washed up into the more accessible bays on the coastlines of the Shackles or Mediogalti Island. Some of the more enterprising residents of Ilizmagorti have developed a method of harvesting the cruel tetrodotoxin poison, from which the tetrolimulus gets its name, for sale to the assassins of the Red Mantis. A single dose of tetrodotoxin sells for 1,300 gp. Its rarity and potency make it a valuable product, and prices outside the Shackles or Mediogalti Island can be 50-100% higher. One dose of poison can be harvested from the corpse of a tetrolimulus, provided the lower half of the creature is intact. This requires a DC 25 Survival check, and even those who usually find themselves competent at skinning or gutting creatures struggle with the intricacies of the sharp tail stinger. In harvesting the tetrodotoxin poison, those without the poison use ability are subject to the standard 5% chance of self-poisoning.",12800
Thalassic Behemoth,20,magical beast,waters,Two massive limbs drag the bulk of this whale-like beast's body from the churning waters of the sea.,"Sent by the gods to punish those who dwell near the sea, thalassic behemoths scourge ships and other vessels from the waters before turning their attention toward structures and survivors on land. Despite their massive bulk, thalassic behemoths swim incredibly fast and can easily outpace all but the fleetest of ships. On land, they can be more readily escaped, at least by those willing and able to leave homes and belongings behind. Though capable of surviving indefinitely on land and employing a clumsy, seal-like locomotion, thalassic behemoths soon weary of gravity's never-ending drag. They rarely venture more than a mile or two from shore before returning to the comforting buoyancy of the seas. Thalassic behemoths resemble immense sperm whales in the waters, but they can quickly haul themselves ashore using their mighty forelimbs. Tail and limb alike shatter wood and stone with but a single blow, while their jaws gape wide enough to swallow smaller boats whole. The coming of a thalassic behemoth is typically foreshadowed by a dramatic increase in missing ships, strange tides, and the uncanny sight of sea life purposefully beaching upon shores. Thalassic behemoths generally spend much of their time lurking a few hundred feet below the surface-but legends hold that even greater behemoths, the dread leviathans, dwell in the deepest oceansic reaches.",307200

Today, they seethe with jealousy that their Elysian kin are allowed to wander the planes at will, while they can leave their Abyssal realm only by stealth. Now, these powerful outsiders spend much of their time brooding, fighting among themselves, and waging war for control of Abyssal realms against the legions of various demon lords.

Thawn,2,humanoid,temperate hills or plains,"A hulking humanoid cloaked in ragged cloth limps forward, its malformed, tumorous arms ending in claws the length of scythe blades. From beneath its rags droop lengths of loose flesh and a strangled wheezing issues from its deformed lips.","Grotesque nomads native to wretched plains and barren hills, thawns seem to bear the curse of both nature and the divine. Ogre-like in stature and dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws, leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and loathing. Thawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their average weight to 700 pounds. Ecology Often called ""mud giants"" due to the foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has led mscholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one, potentially relating them directly to ogres, hills giants, or other humanoids victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates their ugliness and savagery. Opportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses while they wait in hiding. Habitat & Society Most thawns collect in nomadic groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves little better or worse than other. It's their own inhabitance that causes most thawns to move on, as once they've despoiled an area, it's then time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live other way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman possesses some valuable information or reason for departing. Thawns don't believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity. Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things. Even ogres, with whom they hold msimilarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight. If mud giants excel at one thing, it's physical deception. Knowing most creatures' hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing. Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys. With their misshapen frames, it's not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillsock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait. Treasure Thawns rarely keep possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn't consider clothing or food. In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly- slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them.",600
The Oinodaemon,37,outsider,"Gehenna, Hades, or Tarterus","This creature stands nearly twice as tall as a normal human. Its head resembles that of a diseased and rotting ram with downward, forwardcurving horns. The wool and flesh of its humanoid body seem to pull away or drop away in sickly clumps. Its body is covered in boils, blisters, sores, and scabs. Thick white foam oozes from its mouth and a thin yellow ichor squeezes from its bloodshot eyes.","Staff of the Lower Planes: This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded  by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the spell of the same name . Save DCs are 20 + spell level. - Doom, fear  - Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura  - Once per day, wish   The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day. The staff's powers automatically overcome other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact  and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save. The Oinodaemon claims rulership over all other daemons. There is no other single figure in the lower planes that commands more respect and fear than the Oinodaemon . His position is constantly threatened by those who would usurp the throne and take the position for their own. It is believed there are at least seven other extremely power daemons vying for the throne and title of Oinodaemon. Through subtle machinations, sheer power, and fear, the current Oinodaemon has held all challengers at bay. The Oinodaemon attacks using his spells, spell-like abilities, and staff in combat. He does not hesitate to gate in other daemons to assist him. Credit Anthraxus  originally appeared in the First Edition Monster Manual II  and is used by permission.

The Old Man,15,outsider,land,"This old human man is bald, with long white eyebrows and an even longer white beard. He is dressed in an embroidered robe, wears wooden sandals, and carries a staff adorned with metal rings.","The Old Man is the herald of Irori, a teacher, mentor, guide, and trainer in the service of the god of knowledge. He can be patient or irate, confusing or enlightening, lenient or strict, depending on what his students need. He often wanders Golarion as a mortal man, bereft of his supernatural powers, instructing others and leading by example. If attacked when in this limited shape, he usually allows himself to be beaten or killed, especially if his ""death"" would provide a powerful lesson to an important student. If slain as a mortal, he simply reincarnates in his celestial form, unharmed, and never bears a grudge about it. The Old Man's true form is that of an elderly human man, perhaps of Tien or Vudrani ancestry but never clearly identifiable as such. He is typically bald and wiry, and usually wears a long white moustache or beard. Though he appears frail and may support himself with a cane, crutch, or staff, he is incredibly strong and can move with an alien grace when he so chooses. He may dress in a simple robe, an elaborate ceremonial garment, or a simple loincloth. He is often accompanied by one of five animals: a turtle, monkey, ox, rooster, or pig. When not acting on Irori's behalf, he likes tending to animals, planting gardens, meditating, practicing martial arts forms, swimming, and quipping with pretty young students. Ecology The Old Man enjoys exceedingly spicy food, good wine, hearty bread, plain rice, seasoned noodles, and mother kinds of Tien and Vudrani food. He of course does not need to eat, but he enjoys the taste and the act of sharing a friendly meal with mortals. He is normally an example of moderation, but once each year he indulges himself in an episode of gluttony and excess, telling raucous jokes, challenging others to wrestling matches, and pinching bottoms. His antics are meant in good fun, and the targets are usually folks too full of their own superiority to recognize their shortcomings- folks who could stand a good roast, throwdown, or goosing. The Old Man exists mainly to teach, but takes violent action when necessary to protect something of value to his god or destroy a threat to Irori's church. Because he can deal with threats in a nonlethal manner, he may try to subdue and humble an opponent who is merely arrogant or misguided rather than malevolent, but when necessary he has been known to crush the skulls of giants with his bare hands and break the spine of a raging dragon. When in battle, he takes great care to avoid damaging mortal structures, especially places of study, worship, or meditation, preferring to lure his opponents elsewhere-often by pretending to be a coward. Habitat & Society The Old Man loves to see people achieving their potential, even if a person's lifetime limits that potential. He enjoys watching over favored students in successive lifetimes, guiding them in different ways each time. His soul is that of a teacher, and sometimes he claims to be one of Irori's first followers when the god was just a great mortal. If a person genuinely asks him for help with something , he can't help but offer some assistance or guidance, even if he can only contribute a strong back and steady hands-but only if the person asking would otherwise be willing to do the work without help. He often says, ""It is not enough to pray for a thing; you must work for it-the work is the prayer."" The faithful claim that he has helped build hundreds of temples in Vudra, whether by moving heavy stones or simply carrying meals to hungry workers, never revealing his true identity or asking for payment, but accepting simple things if offered, such as a loaf of bread, a cup of wine, or a bowl of rice. When called to Golarion with mortal magic, the Old Man is not so generous with his efforts, for he feels that anyone powerful enough to call him can afford to pay for his services. He is not interested in gold and jewels, but accepts magic items that can aid young monks in their training and travels; rare books of history that contain valuable anecdotes; magic that increases Intelligence or Wisdom; and pledges to build or restore temples, shrines, schools, and monasteries of Irori in places that could benefit from such attention. While he often proves curt when summoned, he quickly assesses the honest needs of whoever called him and proves quick to act if their wishes parallel the will of Irori. In battle, the Old Man is fierce and direct in his attacks and elusive and flexible in his defense. He often uses his abilities to make himself nearly impossible to hit, striking carefully at his opponent to weaken or disable it so he can finish it off quickly. He prefers fighting with his hands or simple weapons such as a club or a staff, and against flying foes he throws individual pebbles the size of sling bullets, usually picking up a handful at a time but sometimes pulling them out of thin air. After a battle, followers of Irori look for pebbles touched by the Old Man, noting the impressions of his fingerprints in the stones and the subtle aura of Irori's blessing. The followers use the pebbles thereafter as reliquaries in a temple or shrine, or incorporate them into magic items or simple jewelry. Sometimes, if the Old Man thinks a dangerous foe can be humbled by a crippling injury and might alter its character because of this, he tries to put out one of an enemy's eyes to teach it a lesson, and only destroys its other eye if the creature continues to fight . He uses his maneuverability on land, air, and waters to his best advantage, especially if he can slow an opponent in difficult terrain. He considers no creature to be his enemy, but willingly battles those who choose to be his opponent. The Five Animals Sometimes the Old Man appears or travels with one of five animals. They do not have unique names, and he addresses them merely as Turtle, Monkey, Ox, Rooster, and Pig. They obey him as well-trained animal might obey its owner, though they can be temperamental and sometimes refuse to follow commands. They do not appear to be more intelligent than common animals or have unusual powers , though they immediately vanish if attacked. The animals may actually be detailed, lifelike projections of animals from the Old Man's mind or perhaps something like a summoner's eidolon, used to present himself as a common man or provide lessons on patience and kindness, but he treats them as if they were individual living creatures he has known for a long time. There may be a secret significance to which animal he brings with him for a particular task , but his followers have been unable to spot a pattern in these choices.",51200
Theletos,7,outsider,any,"Four bandy limbs, each splitting at the elbow into two threefingered forearms, emerge from this creature's crystalline body.","The strange theletos is the guardian of the duality between freedom and fate. Slavery is no more of an issue to a theletos than is true freedom, but without one, the other cannot exist. In areas where slavery is rife, a theletos might aid in freeing some slaves, while in regions where slavery has been abolished, this strange being works to subjugate mcreatures with its own mind-controlling spell-like abilities-often encouraging them to further undertake acts of slavery themselves. The theletos is also a guardian of fate and prophecy, and while for some creatures it might allow glimpses of futures, others who peer into the future almost seem to cause the aeon physical pain. The theletos cannot explain why one seer might be allowed to divine futures while another should not-it knows only that some prophets should be denied this pursuit.

Thin Man,4,fey,warm plains,"The creature is unbelievably slender and has teeth filed to points. Its long, gangly arms end in hands with wickedly sharp nails.","The mysterious thin men of Nuat have long been a part of Rahadoumi legend. They inhabited their tiny island home long before human colonists first arrived, and the so-called thin men have lived on the periphery of Rahadoumi society or among the indigenous cane fields since times long forgotten. Their natural coloration and slender frames serve particularly well in concealing them from the prying eyes of suspicious humans. The thin men use their naturally hard and sharp claws to dig narrow burrows beneath the fields and copses of the island. Their bodies have few bones-instead, their skeletal frameworks are almost entirely cartilaginous in nature, which allows them to navigate their tiny burrows with relative ease and escape the notice of their human neighbors. Their close connection with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins. Though the thin men generally keep to themselves, only observing their human counterparts from the shadows, on occasion they tire of the meager fare of plant roots, grubs, and small vermin on which they normally subsist, and catch a local farmer alone in his fields or traveling at night. On these occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid the patrol of the Pure Legion or posse of vengeful farmers that comes around to search for the killer.",1200
Thoqqua,2,outsider,land,"This creature's thick, serpentine body is protected by dense, horny plates. A visible haze of heat rises from its red-hot scales.","Thoqquas are cantankerous creatures of fire and slag. Their bodies generate incredible heat that allows them to burrow or melt through most surfaces, even solid rock. Thoqquas are native to the vast ash deserts and lava fields where the Plane of Fire abuts the Plane of Earth. There they consume ore and minerals, which their furnace-like bodies then smelt into armor plates that grant the creatures their natural armor-as outsiders, these creatures have no need to eat to survive, but a ""starving"" thoqqua generally has a lower natural armor bonus than a healthy one. A thoqqua's frontmost body segment tapers into a straight, horn-like beak that glows with a blistering heat. Steam and smoke constantly hiss from its joints, and from a distance a thoqqua can be mistaken for a strange metallic construct. Adult thoqquas are 5 feet long and weigh 200 pounds. Their fiery tempers make thoqquas dangerous to approach-they attack without thinking when startled or frustrated. If a thoqqua does not immediately chase away humanoids within its territory, then it gradually comes to view that settlement as property, and even guards it. Mephits seem to understand the thoqqua thought process, and occasionally broker deals with the simple-minded worms. The mephits say that the mountains-sized ancestors of modern thoqquas were servants of the elemental lords, and dug the first volcanoes in the young worlds of the Material Plane. These progenitor worms then retired to the worlds' cores, where their heat warms the planets even today. Thoqquas on the Material Plane do indeed congregate around volcanoes-though whether this is to protect a mineral-rich food site or a sacred place is unknown.",600

Thriae Queen,18,monstrous humanoid,any,"This towering, shapely, purple-skinned woman has an insectile lower body, antennae on her brow, and the wings of a bee.","The most powerful individual within given thriae colony, the queen is a divine soothsayer, a provider of life, and a destroyer of those would seek to disrupt the order of the colony. Viewed by her children as a benevolent matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer should the colony's population meet a devastating blow, whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive, those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured by her beauty and grace, and mwould follow her if only to be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's compare few, and those few are carefully selected from among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as well as loyal. Most thriae colonies only have one queen, though particularly large or far-reaching hives have been known to have as mas three at given time. Thriae queens are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous duties around the hive are analogous to those of other ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination as only a queen can provide. When not divining or performing governmental tasks, a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber, where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they are constantly within extremely close proximity to the queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but nonetheless often prefers to avoid conf licts with would-be assassins or burglars. A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy, golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through several stages of growth before becoming fully formed thriae-the longest stage of development is the larval stage, which is a crucial point in determining the formation of a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a special substance secreted from her merope gland called royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen. The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then faces a choice-either remaining in the colony she was born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does the latter, the remaining queen must birth another successor, which is not considered so much a bother as it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look upon successors who leave as desertsing daughters, instead viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road. THRIAE LARVAE Larvae who are fed regular merope become soldiers, seers, or other contributing members of thriae society. While more susceptible to harm in the larval stage, thriae larvae still pose a threat to unwary intruders who find themselves among the cells of numerous unhatched thriae. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check or Knowledge  check notice larvae embedded in the hive's waxy walls. Unhatched thriae larvae can detect disturbances outside their cell walls, and burst from the cells in order to prey upon the nutritious intruders. Any creature within 5 feet of a larval cell must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid becoming infested with the larvae. A creature that becomes infested must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking 1d2 points of Constitution damage and falling asleep-additional Constitution damage from feeding larvae does not wake sleeping victims. Feeding larvae can be detached from the creature they cling to by cutting them off with a slashing weapon  or by dealing cold damage to the larvae at time, which also deals half damage to the creature the larvae are covering. Remove disease or a similar effect kills thriae larvae on the host.",153600
Thriae Seer,11,monstrous humanoid,any,"Lithe and beautiful, this half-bee, half-woman creature wears elaborate makeup and wields an ornate staff.","Sought after for their wisdom and guidance as well as their enchanting beauty, thriae seers are among the most spiritually gifted members of their colony. Their prowess for foretelling the future and deciding upon the soundest courses of action in dire situations earns them respect from other thriae as well as outsiders from other societies, and seers wield their gift with a stoic humbleness. Nonetheless, most seers expect an offering before they will grant an audience a divination. These offerings usually consist of ornate jewelry and sums of gold, though some seers desire the compof humanoid male or female consorts, mof whom gladly oblige the captivating seer with their presence. While their combative abilities mainly comprise their magical powers and they appear at first glance to be thin and frail, seers still possess the trademark strength and resilience of all thriae. Thriae seers spend most of their time meditating in one of the mchambers in the colony's hive dedicated to such activities. Consuming large amounts of their queen's merope to enhance their powers of divination, seers ponder the best solutions to their colony's problems, and often act as a sort of spiritual political council for the queen. If a particularly wealthy group of outsiders has sought the counsel of several thriae seers, this council of prophetesses will combine their powers in order to read a difficult divination. Thriae seers are 6 feet from head to toe and weigh 150 pounds. The thriae seer presented here represents the least of her kind. Mthriae seers take levels of monk or rogue so as to be even more adept at protecting their queen. Thriae oracles and sorcerers are also relatively common-such thriae are particularly valued by their hive for their magical abilities.",12800
Thriae Soldier,4,monstrous humanoid,any,This creature has the upper body of a woman and the lower body of a bee. She wields a longbow with uncanny skill.,"The guardians of the thriae colony and its treasures, thriae soldiers make up the backbone of a hive's defenses. Whether patrolling the perimeter of the hive or protecting its queen and seers from attackers, soldiers are a crucial asset ensuring a colony's survival, and so it makes sense that they compose the majority of thriae populations. While not as spiritually powerful as their seer and queen kin, soldiers possess remarkable agility and skill with the bow. Guards remain stationed in pairs outside doors to important areas, such as the meditation chambers of seers and the enormous private quarters of the queen, and when their duties take them outside the walls of the hive, they travel in large convoys. A thriae soldier's stinger carries within it especially potent venom similar to that of giant bees, and the soldier can easily apply this poison to her weapons. While most soldiers carry bows, they are also trained at an early age with a multitude of both melee and ranged weapons, and some prefer the feel of a sword or hammer. Regardless of the type, all thriae weapons and armors are expertly crafted, made of steel and gilded with intricate decorations of gold and amber-hued gems. Thriae soldiers are often talented artisans as well as warriors, and most create their own weapons to bear in combat. Since there are exponentially more soldiers than seers in given colony, thriae queens ration merope sparingly to soldiers, whose use of it doesn't provoke the divine insight cherished by thriae culture, but rather inspires courage and brute strength on the battlefield. When a thriae soldier consumes merope, her reflexes quicken, her wits sharpen, and she gains a second wind, so most individuals save their rationed doses for times of dire need. When circumstances are especially grim, commanders of thriae militias will order all of their troops to consume their merope at once, giving the compthe final burst of strength it needs to turn the tide of battle. Thriae soldiers are heavier-set than most of their slender thriae sisters, and average individuals weigh about 200 pounds and measure 6 feet from head to toe.",1200

Riding the winds with its massive wings spread wide, the thundershrike is thought by some cultures to be a herald of the gods of the thunderstorms. Thundershrikes are often found in the compof storm giants. Thundershrikes get their name from their habit of taking to the air during powerful storms. Wind and rain follow the wings of a thundershrike. Often worshipped by barbarians and other wilderness dwellers, the thundershrikes are a proud species that view all that they survey as their territory. Although they keep their nests in isolated aeries in the high mountains, thundershrikes can range several hundred miles in search of food. Thundershrikes mate for life, and females usually lay a clutch of 2d4 eggs in the spring. The eggs hatch in the late summer during the height of the storm season. Young remain in the nest for several months before venturing out on their own in the world. Unless it is on the hunt, a thundershrike is content to ride the winds and generally leave other creatures alone. If hunting, the thundershrike attacks creature of Large or smaller size that appears tasty. A thundershrike opens combat with its lightning bolts before swooping or diving at a foe. It rarely lands during melee, preferring to attack from the air, using its spell-like abilities, and its snatch and hover to pick up and separate multiple foes.

Tiberolith,10,construct,coastlines or waters,"A bizarre thrum echoes from somewhere deep within this towering stone hulk, the ground roiling beneath the monolithic creature's stony feet as blue liquid runs down its shuddering body.","Eerie animate ruins thought by mto be remnants of the long-vanished Ghol-Gan civilization, tiberoliths were created to protect their vicious masters' villages and citadels. Found among isolated or submerged ruins, these ancient defenders are hewn from great slabs of stone and held together with mysterious, sinewy materials that sometimes look frighteningly like human flesh. Even more sinister, though, is the mysterious technology imbued within these terrifying sentinels. When disturbed, tiberoliths transform from monolithic watchers to glowing avengers, wreaking destruction on all in their paths. Because of their painstaking fabrication process, no two tiberoliths look exactly alike. Each individual's body is covered in a unique pattern of markings-often depicting horrific, cannibalistic rituals-that blaze azure when the guard activates. Genderless, bare-fisted warriors, the creatures often display features meant to further strike fear into the hearts of intruders, such as enormous tusks, a lion-shaped head, or a crown of spears. With fists the size of boulders, tiberoliths typically stand 18 feet tall and weigh 7,000 pounds. Ecology Nearly as old as the land and seas themselves, tiberoliths have been the subject of countless native myths. Some insist that in fervent devotion to their dark religion, the Ghol-Gan created tiberoliths as playthings for their gods. Others claim the ancient people sacrificed entire villages of souls to a powerful, bloodthirsty deity in exchange for the tiberoliths' protective technology. Most scholars, however, believe the Ghol-Gan spent centuries building tiberoliths to serve as the guardians of their most treasured assets. It still remains unclear, however, why these mighty defenders have survived while their creators did not. Though quite rare, tiberoliths have been the focus of much obsession among those few who know of their existence, primarily because of the enigmas that continue to surround them. Some who live near one of the ancient colossi believe the blue fluid flowing within an activated tiberolith acts as a panacea, or is otherwise a magical agent. However, those seekers lucky enough to have defeated one of the guardians invariably find themselves disappointed. Far from mystical, the fluid exhibits no magic whatsoever, and is as caustic as acid, burning through flesh as easily as through fabric. Given the combination of both acid and electricity inside the tiberoliths, some alchemists have posited that the tiberoliths are powered by enormous techno-magical batteries. Perhaps more terrifying is the thought that the tiberoliths might actually be batteries, meant to be gathered together for some great magical undertaking, in which case the greatest treasure a tiberolith guards may be the tiberolith itself. For some industrious adventurers, especially those of an arcane or alchemical bent, a tiberolith represents an opportunity to cultivate a powerful, forgotten technology-yet such experimentation rarely succeeds, more often resulting in the pulverized or acid-eaten corpse of the would-be scholar. While tiberoliths' limbs all bear hollows securing puzzlebox-like devices, modern scholars have yet to determine the exact nature of the apparatuses, and how they relate to the constructs' operation. Based on reports of tiberoliths' unpredictability in battle, both historical and recent, it seems the Ghol-Gan never quite perfected the technology, either. Over the years, adventurers traversing former Ghol-Gan strongholds have recorded numerous sightings of these rare creations. Tiberoliths do not patrol their homelands, however. When undisturbed, they resemble frightful statues resting in ruined cities, standing outside crumbling ziggurats, or breaking the canopy of thick jungles. It's only when uninvited humanoids venture past that these hulking statues come to life, oblivious to the fact that those they once served have long since vanished from this world. Habitat & Society Tiberoliths are typically found alone among Ghol-Gan ruins, particularly those located in the Isles of the Shackles. It's said tiberoliths are most numerous on islands such as the horrifying Cannibal Isles, the eerie Devil's Arches, the haunted Yoha's Graveyard, and the intrepid Ushinawa Isles, despite the efforts of the latter's samurai inhabitants to eradicate the behemoths. On rare occasions, tiberoliths are found slumbering in squads of three or four, usually positioned to protect the ruined entrances of their lost creators' most sacred structures. Whether alone or in groups, mtiberoliths have been inactive so long they've become obscured by overgrowth or claimed by rising sea levels. They might nearly blend in with the environment, but the sound tiberoliths make when activated-a high-pitched whirring not unlike the shriek of an eagle-is unmistakable. Although tiberoliths are generally considered unintelligent servants of their vanished masters, an ancient legend speaks of an uncharted island in the Shackles where tiberoliths appear to have gained some measure of sentience. This tale states that, within the hollow of an inactive volcano, a terrifying number of whirring tiberoliths go through the motions of the most heinous Ghol-Gan rituals in a ghostly tribute to their lost masters. However, because of the story's dubious origins- and the sheer unlikeliness of its claims- most people regard this as little more than a fireside tale. Construction A tiberolith is created from three to four slabs of naturally occurring stone such as limestone, typically weighing 2,000 to 2,500 pounds each. These slabs must be bound with vegetative- or sinew-based lashing materials treated with rare unguents costing at least 7,000 gp. The processes by which tiberoliths are created are exceptionally rare, and most of the secrets to doing so were lost with the fall of Ghol-Gan. Certain explorers, scholars, and magic-users from the Shackles might possess these secrets and be willing to share them, but they could cost upward of 10,000 gp.

Tidepool Dragon,3,dragon,warm coastlines,"This small draconic creature seems better suited for the waves than wind, its wings sweeping along its body like massive fins. Light from the waters refracts off its resilient-looking cerulean hide as it snaps crustacean-like claws.","waters dragons similar in size and fickleness to faerie dragons and pseudodragons, tidepool dragons rule as whimsical tyrants over miniature realms comprising coral forests, sand dune mountains, and low-tide menageries. Preferring to inhabit coastlines regions throughout the world's warmer climes, these dragon-kin make their lairs amid balmy lagoons and hidden coves, favoring seaside setting devoid of stronger predators. A combination of chitinous shell-similar in shade to that of a blue crab-and scales the color of clear tropical waters covers every tidepool dragon, the shade deepening through twilight hues to a shade as dark as a oceans abyss. Tidepool dragons typically measure about 2 feet long and weigh approximately 14 pounds. They are known to live for about 300 years. Ecology Despite their size, tidepool dragons are hardy and well suited to their environment. Their sweeping fin-wings work equally well both above and beneath the waters. While underwaters, these dragons use their fins to make languid, powerful strokes, propelling them forward in graceful bursts, but the strong, flexible musculature beneath the fins also allows them to make quick, dramatic turns essential in pursing eels, small fish, and other agile prey. Above the waters these same appendages work like wings, the membranous skin spreading over bones and cartilage to catch currents of air. Mobservers who have glimpsed these creatures both above and below the waves claim that they do not fly so much as swim through the skies. The tiny dragons' dense muscle mass, particularly in their tails, allows them to create momentum strong enough to break the surface of the waters and send them skiesward in their characteristic glides. Although they prefer to eat fish, tidepool dragons often use their flight to chase seabirds off the surface of the waves and high into the skies, while the small, tough teeth that line every tidepool dragon's mouth can easily crack the hard shells of crabs and other shellfish. The tidepool dragon is amphibious, possessing both gills and lungs, and can exist outside of waters indefinitely. While it is in flight, muscles stretch its gill slits so they lie flat along the body, decreasing resistance to the wind. At the apex of the dragon's complex respiratory system, near the base of the creature's throat, a pair of small bones hang down. Tidepool dragons can vibrate these bones at an almost unthinkable speed, and the furious motion gives off intense heat. They can then draw waters through their bodies from their gills and push it out of their mouths. As this torrent of waters passes the vibrating bones, it heats to temperatures beyond scalding, capable of burning flesh and even melting glass. Even when not submerged, tidepool dragons can draw moisture from the air through their gills to power their breath weapons. But despite the potency of a tidepool dragon's breath when used in flight or on land, these creatures usually employ their breath weapons while underwaters. When the dragons are submerged, their scalding gout of waters diffuses into a small cloud of boiling waters, allowing them to affect entire schools of fish or other groups of prey in a single boiling burst. Habitat & Society Tidepool dragons get their name from their tendency to frequent small coastlines pools, where they bask and sleep because they are usually safe from other predators there and their shell-like hides blend well with the brilliant colors of local waters fauna. Those attempting to capture or otherwise contain a tidepool dragon find it a challenging task, as the creature's freedom of movement ability makes most nets, ropes, and simple attempts to grab it near useless. ""Slippery as a tide wyrm"" is a phrase often bandied about by sailors and other seafarers when trying to cross treacherously wet decks or wrestle the rigging of a loose and blowing sail. Despite being almost impossible to catch, tidepool dragons can be bargained with rather readily, as their interests, while fickle, are quite simple. Those seeking tidepool dragons' favor-or, at least, hoping not to incur their mischief-can make offerings to the dragon, typically in the form of coins, gems, or particularly shiny shells so that the miniature wyrms can mimic their larger kin. Additionally, most tidepool dragons enjoy rare fish that cannot be found in their home waters, or fruits and vegetables from far inland that they've never sampled. Capricious and self-serving, these miniature dragons possess a less savory reputation than their faerie dragon or pseudodragon cousins, making enemies as easily as they make allies. Highly territorial, most tidepool dragons take offense if the waters and coastlines near their lairs are intruded upon, blasting trespassers with their breath weapons or perpetrating various pranks upon them. If satisfied, though-typically by being bribed with shiny baubles or salty food-tidepool dragons can prove quite helpful, serving other creatures for the promise of more rewards. Clever sailors have been known to leave trails of enticing foods in their ships' wakes in an effort to draw the attention of tidepool dragons. If successful, a vessel can gain a valuable helper, capable of acting as a lookout both far above and far below the waters. Several waters species, such as merfolk, tritons, waters elves, and even sahuagin, also recognize the benefits of keeping tidepool dragons as allies, and some explorers have recorded colonies of such waters humanoids where well-fed clutches of these dragons act as sentries or scouts. When left to their own devices, tidepool dragons live in small coastlines caves, usually in mated pairs or related family clutches. These lairs always contain exit shafts into the skies beyond since tidepool dragon eggs and new hatchlings are a favorite prey of bunyips. Tidepool dragon eggs are about the size of a chicken or crocodile egg, but are marked with the same colors that will eventually grace the hatchlings' scales. Parents hatch their young and then raise them until they are capable of surviving on their own, around age 3. At that point, young tidepool dragons set off to find mates and indulge their species' rampant curiosity. Single youths also band together to form non-familial pods for hunting and adventure. Tidepool Dragons as Familiars Although difficult to approach, tidepool dragons sometimes choose to serve as the familiars of unruly spellcasters and those who go out of their way to feed them rich or exotic foods. Spellcasters of 7th level or higher with an alignment within one step of chaotic neutral can gain a tidepool dragon as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.",800

Though they are not born evil, it is an easy path for them to find, especially as most suffer at the hands of ""normal"" folks while growing up. Tieflings look mostly human except for some physical traits that reveal their strange heritage. Tiefling Characters Tieflings are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial HD. They have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Tieflings are quick in body and mind, but are inherently strange. Darkvision: Tieflings see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: Tieflings have a +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Stealth checks. Spell-Like Ability: Tieflings can use darkness once per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability equals the tief ling's class level. Fiendish Resistance: Tieflings have cold resistance 5, electricity resistance 5, and fire resistance 5. Fiendish Sorcery: See above. Languages: Tieflings begin play speaking Common and either Abyssal or Infernal. Tieflings with high Intelligence scores can choose of the following: Abyssal, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Infernal, and Orc.",200
Tiger,4,animal,forests,"This powerful feline predator moves with a deadly grace, its reddish-orange fur slashed with black stripes.","Tigers stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds. Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their territories, and have been known to kill bears, crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to waters as their hunting grounds. While the tiger itself is a fearsome predator, its strength and ferocity pales in comparison to that of the larger dire tiger. Known to mscholars as the smilodon and to tribal societies as the saber-toothed tiger, the dire tiger is invariably one of the region's top predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors that hang down like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding menacingly even when the creature's mouth is shut. These immense hunting cats grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to 6,000 pounds.",1200
Tiger Fish,1,animal,warm rivers or swamps,"Deadly, wolf like teeth fill the mouth of this brawny fish.","Tiger fish roam tropical watersways, their long, streamlined bodies built for speed. They can grow to lengths of up to 6 feet and weigh as much as 150 pounds.",400
Tikoloshe,3,undead,"warm forests, oceans, or rivers","The waters churns and splashes as a small, stocky humanoid surges forth, gnashing rows of needle-like teeth, its eye sockets merely deep gouges. As if it were one with the waters itself, it darts quickly forward, shouting curses and swinging its fists.","Cruel and spiteful, tikoloshe  are small undead that haunt tropical watersways and jungles, preying on travelers and villagers alike with their magical abilities and appetite for harm. Tikoloshe stand no higher than a gnome or a human child, but their bodies are dense and muscular; mhave large potbellies and arms long enough for their knuckles to score the dirt as they walk. Their creation leaves them with blackened, eyeless sockets, but tikoloshe can ""see"" using their giant, bat-like ears. Their skin is smooth and shines whether wet or dry. Tikoloshe are genderless; they stand about 4 feet tall and weigh almost 150 pounds. Ecology Tikoloshe are created from the corpses of the dead, but are not mindless like some zombies or skeletons. Creating a tikoloshe requires a ritual wherein a spellcaster places a newly dead humanoid body in a specially crafted clay basin of shallow waters and then bores a hole through the corpse's eyes with a red-hot poker. As the creator casts magical fire through this aperture, the surrounding waters is rapidly drawn into the body. As it does, the corpse shrinks and changes, casting off all vestiges of its former features and replacing them with those of all tikoloshe. The conf licting forces of fire and waters animate the tikoloshe and instill it with its well-known hostility. The tikoloshe's creator can exact one service from its new creation, but afterward has no control over the creature. A tikoloshe's undead traits and resistance to fire make it an ideal servant for mtasks. Some are forced to mine rare minerals deep underwaters or to capture exotic elemental creatures on fiery planes. Other creators use tikoloshe as sinister pawns to curse or even kill hated adversaries. Once released from servitude, tikoloshe prefer to inhabit watersways and shallow seabeds where they can rest undisturbed and where they can surprise travelers, fisherfolk, and swimmers. When partially submerged, a tikoloshe's body merges with the surrounding waters, making it difficult to see and battle. When not near waters, tikoloshe dwell in shallow holes under rocks and large trees, and even under porches and raised buildings in small villages. While their bodies do not require food to sustain themselves, tikoloshe enjoy stalking and eating smaller creatures like birds, frogs, and rabbits. They particularly relish killing monkeys, as they enjoy the nearly human screams the unfortunate animals make. Tikoloshe will sometimes make ghastly fetishes of their kills and leave them on the fences or doorsteps of local settlements to hint at their presence and cause fear among those they seek to torment. As a result, mjunglestribes place rare or semiprecious stones on the thresholds of their homes as an offering for tikoloshe to eat, claiming that doing so protects that home against the creature's wrath. Although some scholars dismiss such practices as abject superstition, druids and clerics of the Mwangi Expanse assert that by ingesting a potent fragment of earth, tikoloshe are able to soothe the opposing elemental forces within them and thus still their malevolent nature. Habitat & Society Tikoloshe form gangs and clans whenever possible, knowing that their ability to cause mayhem is greater in numbers. Individually, they haunt inhabited areas using their invisibility to cause strange, uncanny incidents like unlocking doors to animal pens, moving and breaking household objects, and spoiling food. Tikoloshe often use their curse to bestow bad luck on those that they haunt. Watching from their invisible perches, from beneath beds, and even from inside closets and cupboards, the tikoloshe take spiteful glee in observing those whom they have rendered suddenly clumsy, weak, or otherwise inept as they fumble even the simplest of tasks. Mtikoloshe use their powers for more than mischief, however, and can prove a serious threat to both residents and travelers of the Mwangi Expanse. When fighting as a pack or clan, tikoloshe use their rapid swimming to close with foes, quickly swarming a single target and dragging it underwaters. On land, groups of tikoloshe use invisibility to get close to opponents, seeking to curse as menemies as possible before losing the element of surprise. They are cunning enough to use physically debilitating curses on heavily armed folk and mind-harming curses on those who they think might be spellcasters. Individual tikoloshe always try to flee when faced with organized resistance. If tracked or cornered, tikoloshe plead for their lives by offering a service to their captors, usually the same one that was exacted from them upon their creation. Those who accept a tikoloshe's offer may indeed benefit from the creature's service, but they must also be very cautious, as tikoloshe are not bound by promises they make once their original commitment to their creator has been fulfilled. Cunning tikoloshe are known to barter their services for their lives, but only to buy enough time for their new masters to turn their backs. Variant Tikoloshe Depending on the ritual used and the quality of the materials, some tikoloshe look different than the standard dwarf-gremlin variety. Some look like horrid Small werebears in hybrid form, or like a worm-like creature with a dog's head and golden tongue. These variants may or may not have the burned-out eyeholes of the ""standard"" tikoloshe. Creating Tikoloshe The process of creating a tikoloshe is more complex than for animating most undead creatures, but requires the same fundamental magic. Ultimately, the creation process culminates in the casting of the spell create undead. In addition to the normal components of the spell, creating a tikoloshe requires the equipment and process previously noted, adding 1 day of effort and 100 gold pieces to the typical requirements of the spell. Typically, a caster loses control over a tikoloshe after the undead performs one service for him, though creators of level 15 or higher retain control. Tikoloshe in Mythology The tikoloshe is an evil zombie or waters spirit depicted as a trickster in tales throughout Southern Africa. Able to hurl curses and turn invisible by swallowing pebbles, tikoloshe are described as playing all manner of poltergeist-like tricks on people, although some tales depict them assaulting sleeping women or biting off toes during the night, giving the creatures a more sinister quality. Descriptions of the tikoloshe vary from myth to myth, but most emphasize its gremlin-like features, small stature, and the burned-out holes where its eyes should be. Cultural historians claim that the latter links the creature definitively to Zulu mythology because of the importance of fire in most Zulu legends. To this day, the tikoloshe is synonymous with misfortune, and the creature's name is invoked whenever a person suffers bad luck.",800
Time Flayer,12,outsider,Elemental Plane of Time,"Before you stands a shimmering white humanoid with eyes of sparkling fire. It has no other discernable features and slender form is draped only in thin black robes. In its fist, it clenches a shimmering greatsword. The being moves with an elegant grace, almost as though floating just a few inches above the ground.","Time flayers are natives to the Elemental Plane of Time and are most often encountered on that plane, the Astral Plane, or the Ethereal Plane. Occasionally a time flayer slips into the Material Plane, but most such encounters occur when a hole is torn in the time continuum and it pulls a time flayer through, depositing it on the Material Plane. When such an event occurs, a time flayer usually looks for a way back to its native plane . Some time flayers purposefully journey to the Material Plane as if they are searching for something-sages and scholars are unsure what it is they are looking for. Time flayers coexist on their native plane with time elementals who they detest. Why this animosity exists is unknown, but neither creature likes the other and they always attack each other on sight. Note that time flayers often gain the upper hand in this battle as they are unaffected by the aging attack of a time elemental. Time flayers fight with their greatswords in battle all the while attempting to discern the most powerful foe in a group. Once it has targeted such a foe, it uses its temporal displacement ability to effectively remove that creature from combat for a few rounds. If faced with certain extinction, a time flayer rips a hole in the time continuum and slips away using its time jaunt ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",19200
Tiny Monstrous Sea Wasp,0.25,vermin,warm waters,"A translucent blue and nearly invisible in waters, this cube-shaped jellyfish has four distinct sides and trails dozens of extremely long tentacles.","Monstrous sea wasps are deadly waters creatures with long, writhing and highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm waters and tend to congregate near coastlines regions or rivers mouths where they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the waters, the sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply float along in the waters waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison  is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience. A creature stung by a sea wasp that lives to tell about, never forgets its brush with this monstrosity. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.",100

They attack other living creatures fearlessly, and require constant sustenance to nourish their vast bulk. Humanoids are in most danger from titan centipedes when mounted rather than afoot-a good-sized horse makes a much more satisfying meal to the centipede than a few bites of human. Titan centipedes are solitary by nature and because of the demands of their appetite, though when food is plentiful, multiple centipedes sometimes lurk in the same area.",6400

His ability to manipulate others is legendary throughout the Hells, and it is because of this gift that Dispater allows him to attend infernal meetings where dukes are normally prohibited. Titivilus spends most of his days in his tower, Martyr's Curse, a large structure composed of blackened iron. When encountered away from his tower he usually has a small retinue of bearded devils or erinyes with him. Titivilus stands 6 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds. Titivilus prefers to avoid combat, if possible. If pressed, he attacks with his spell-like abilities, seeking to sew confusion and disorder among his adversaries. In close combat, he uses his longsword, but usually summons other devils before such combat occurs. If facing imminent defeat, Titivilus summons other devils to cover his escape.

Tojanida,5,outsider,waters,"This creature resembles a cross between a turtle and a crab, with flippers instead of legs, a snapping beak, and two pincers.","Tojanidas are bizarre natives from the Plane of waters that resemble mixes between monstrous crabs and enormous snapping turtles. Originally elemental beings of waters, tojanidas were bound into their strange forms long ago for unclear reasons, and no longer know how they might eventually return to their pure and formless state. Determined to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures- especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make fearsome opponents, violent and eager juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers. Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long and weigh several hundred pounds. When threatened, a tojanida can retract its limbs most of the way into its shell, which is an irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely encircling the tojanida's shell along its rim makes the creature extremely difficult to catch by surprise. While tojanidas adore eating, as they find flavor and texture to be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't actually need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance directly from the currents of arcane energy all around them via the magic of their shells. Blessed  with extremely long racial memories, tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes of innumerable worlds, attempting to find unusual physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting them from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of remembering their ancestors' experiences. Though the tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden of memory, adventurers and scholars often seek the use of a tojanida's recalled lore.",1600
Tombstone Fairy,9,fey,any,"This wicked little creature is dressed in the garb of an undertaker and resembles a tiny gargoyle. It has tiny black close set eyes, and its skin is slate gray.","Tombstone fairies are wicked beings that dwell within graveyards, raising murderers and evil heroes from the dead to go out and continue their deadly work. They often demand some form of repayment for the raising of such beings, keeping the creature's funeral shroud as a bargaining chip. This payment could range from magical or monetary treasures, the murder of a specific enemy and so on. Failure to make payment within 30 days usually results in the raised individual dying again. Upon payment, the formerly dead is given their shroud and is free to go about committing whatever foul deeds they wish. Tombstone fairies are generally solitary creatures, but on occasion a small group of them comes together with a single goal: raise a small band of evil dead to further the fairies' own ends. A tombstone fairy stands about 3 feet tall and weighs around 35 pounds. Its skin is always slate gray and its hair is either dark brown or black. Its eyes are always black.

Upon consuming a victim, the animate statue becomes a walking prison, holding its victim within with little chance for escape. The iron statue can then return its victim to the proper cell, the feet of its lord, or other fate its creator determines.

As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forests, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forests in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves angry treants well. Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given individual sometimes responsible for an entire forests, but they occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce.

Treerazer,25,outsider,Tanglebriar,The twenty-foot-tall winged saurian demon wields an aciddripping axe. Two red eyes glow above a tooth-filled beak.,"Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored minion and lieutenant  of Cyth-V'sug, Demon Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V'sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V'sug was unable  to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing. Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent mcenturies wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V'sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves ""walled off "" this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar's heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation's security. Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures  from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons . In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he's forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge. Treerazer's Cult Cults of Treerazer are quite rare beyond Kyonin, where secret cabals of cultists venerate him. When they do appear beyond these borders, they are secretive but sadistic groups, eager to sacrifice nonbelievers yet cunning in remaining undetected by the law of the land. Treerazer's symbol is a bleeding dead tree that's been split in half. His clerics have access to the Domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Plant. His favored weapon is the battleaxe.",1228800

Tribal Totem,6,construct,any,"With the splintering sound of dry, cracking wood, a human-sized graven image lurches to life. Its features shift and reform with every step, cycling through a variety of faces both strange and oddly familiar. Bits of feather, leaves, and decorative stone embellish its surface, and the strong smell of lacquer and resin assaults the senses as it draws near with a menacing, ponderous gait.","Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem. As mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically placed within villages to aid against attacks. Others carry stored messages on their tribe's behalf or vocalize their creator's words. Rarer still are the tribal totems purposed for war, which emerge from the junglesas a potent force capable of spearheading invasions and targeting enemy champions. While most tribal totems are made of wood and combine exaggerated features of folkloric monsters with simple decorations and images of strength , few look exactly alike, as each embodies the deities, fears, or legends of its creator's people. Tribal totems tend to stand 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds. Ecology As constructs, tribal totems have no significant ecological niche. They exist at the whim of their creators and protect their assigned tribes from harm. The divine spark that powers them emanates from the continued adulation and combined spiritual energy of the tribe, but relies upon constant rekindling. Each morning, the totem requires lengthy ritual adoration to renew its power. Otherwise, the totem remains still, appearing to be nothing more than a decorative statue. During elaborate festivals and revels, tribal natives usually spend several hours honoring the totem to ensure it remains vigilant for mdays. They also take care to mend and repair damage it might have suffered on their behalf. Once charged in this manner, the totem may operate remotely for mdays at a time, undertaking longer trips on the tribe's behalf to hunt down enemies whose likeness it acquires. Habitat & Society Tribal shamans, oracles, or witchdoctors most commonly undertake the rituals necessary to construct a tribal totem, guiding the rest of the tribe in worshiping and maintaining it. The totem only obeys the commands of its creator or someone appointed by her. In the event of conf licting orders, it always obeys its creator above anyone else loaned such authority. Typically, a tribal totem spends its entire existence within the confines of its creator's village, and is completely dependent on the continuing worship of the tribe to give it a semblance of life. Only in rare cases might a multitude of tribes gather their totems together for some shared offensive. Tales also tell of crazed hermits and shamanic outcasts who have created multiple tribal totems and then set them against specific individuals or whole tribes who garner their ire. Greater Tribal Totems Legends also tell of more advanced versions of tribal totems, some reaching Large or even Huge size. Serving as guardians of important religious or cultural sites, these totems possess multiple faces, one on each side of their heads, enabling them to take on the conjoined likeness of up to four victims at a time. They also gain the following additional abilities: • +3 natural armor • +4 Strength, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma • All-Around Vision  A greater tribal totem gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks and cannot be flanked. • Extended Effigy  A greater tribal totem is no longer dependent on line of sight to affect victims with its shared condition ability. Instead, it can extend this power to creature that has ever been in its line of sight and is currently within 5 miles, often enabling its creators to inf lict terrible punishments upon their enemies through the totem's connection. Construction A tribal totem is always carved from a single type of wood chosen for its density and beauty-typically, ebony, mahogany, or some other valuable resource whose value is at least 1,000 gp. Some tribes use ivory instead, lashing together the pieces and then relying on the magic of the totem's construction to knit everything into a single whole. Decorations of leafy fronds, stones, animalistic trophies, and paint help complete the appearance. Initially, a creator shapes a totem's features into a ferocious, monstrous image. Then, the application of the proper spells enables the construct to alter its appearance to mimic other creatures.

Tripurasura,2,outsider,any,"This tiny monstrosity has the body of a well-muscled man, a crown of frilled horns, and eyes that glow like rubies.","Tripurasuras, or sly ones, are among the weakest asuras, manifestations not of divine mistakes but instead creations of the most powerful of asuras exhibiting their loathing of the gods by creating blasphemous mockeries of their creations. A newly created tripurasura most commonly exists for one of two reasons: to give an asurendra sage the raw materials it needs to create more powerful asuras, or to seek out mortals-especially mortal spellcasters-to recruit into the asura cause. Using its power to assume a pleasing or innocuous form, a tripurasura wanders the world, seeking pious mortals to corrupt. When it encounters a promising spellcaster , the tripurasura presents itself as an apprentice, pilgrim, or other type of curious student eager to learn from the spellcaster. The tripurasura keeps its true nature and its powers hidden, and seeks opportunities to steer its ""master"" away from decisions it might have made in good conscience to acts that promote the collapse of religious belief, faith, and society. When, as it inevitably does, the wayward spellcaster runs afoul of justice or is confronted by those seeking revenge, the tripurasura fades away to watch the final stage of the spellcaster's fall from grace, then seeks a new victim in another city or region. Some spellcasters, on the other hand, actually seek out these tiny fiends to employ as familiars. A tripurasura greatly values these opportunities, since it need not abandon its master once its work is done and can continue to spread its agenda for as long as its master survives. A spellcaster must be lawful evil, at least 7th level, and have the Improved Familiar feat to gain a tripurasura as a familiar.",600
Triton,2,outsider,oceans,"This scaly, finned humanoid has an athletic build and blue-green coloration. Its legs end in wide flippers rather than feet.","These waters outsiders resemble merfolk, except where a merman has a single fish tail, a triton has two scaly, finned legs. They are the watchers of the sea, often using dolphins or other waters creatures as mounts, and maintaining a vigil against the evil races below the waves. Originally hailing from the Plane of waters, long ago the triton race migrated to the oceans of the Material Plane, and they are now fully adapted to life there. Their split legs allow them to hobble about slowly on land, but they rarely do so, preferring their natural environment and the greater mobility their forms afford there. Tritons make their homes on the sea floor, growing coral reefs and sculpting stones into gentle arcs to create living spaces that are beautiful and naturallooking. Mof these sites lie near great thermal vents, providing not only heat but also rich minerals and nutrients for the fish and other creatures tritons eat. Tritons can breathe air or waters, but prefer waters. While their cities are designed for waters-breathers, they usually feature one or two airtight buildings set aside to hold air for landwalking visitors. Triton settlements can be found anywhere from arctic to tropical waters, but most are in temperate locations. They generally avoid the deepest reaches of the oceans, for it is here that creatures like aboleths and krakens rule-creatures that the tritons have long waged war against. Tritons maintain relationships with other good undersea creatures, but mostly keep to themselves. They aid others in fights against their enemies . They typically form strong squadrons of waters cavalry trained in coordinated attacks when they go to war. Tritons tend to distrust outsiders, and usually avoid land-dwellers. They sometimes provide aid to airbreathers, even though they often see them as trespassers under the sea; when they do help landwalkers, their price for this is high. Nevertheless, when they witness a landwalker do battle against and vanquish a great evil such as an aboleth, they are quick to cast aside their prejudices and accept the great hero into their societies with open and welcoming arms. Tritons have silvery skin, hued in tones of aqua blue and kelp green. Older tritons often have barnacles, corals, and seashells crusting the back, chest, and shoulders, worn almost like jewelry as a mark of status among their kind. They have white, blue, or green hair. Tritons' eyes shine blue like sunlight upon a clear sea. A typical triton stands 6 feet in height and weighs 180 pounds. While most exceptional tritons advance by taking class levels , a rare few tritons advance by increasing in size. These Large tritons are great heroes among their kind and have 8 racial Hit Dice or more.",600
Troblin,2,humanoid,temperate forests,"This hideous humanoid creature is a twisted amalgamation of extra limbs, thickened hide, and protruding growths.","A troblin is a twisted creature, born of the union of a troll and a goblin. Due to the horrid side effects of their diminished regenerative abilities, the overall appearance of a troblin is difficult to quantify. No two troblins look exactly alike. One troblin may be covered in tough scars that have thickened its skin, while another may have two forearms sprouting from the elbow of one arm. Other troblins may have two arms on one side, or two feet on one leg. Troblin bands build their lairs in forestsed areas away from more civilized lands. They are hunter-gatherers and use the land as a means of survival, hunting deer, elk, moose, and other game animals. In general, troblins stand 5 feet tall, with crooked noses, long arms and legs, and large flapping feet. A troblin shares in the characteristics of both its parents, resembling a very tall goblin with troll-like facial features. Its skin is blotched in shades of green, grey, and dull yellow. Its eyes range from pale red to an ochre color. Troblins dress in drab-colored clothing and furs made from the hides of animals. Troblins are a disorganized lot, and rarely engage in sort of formal tactics or strategy. When a troblin war band encounters opponents, they simply attack with as much strength and ferocity as they can muster. Troblins are even more craven and cowardly than goblins, and a lone troblin usually runs from combat in which it is outnumbered. Troblin Society Troblins have no real society to speak of. They congregate in looselyorganized bands lead by a single strong chieftain, but they are nomadic and never remain in one place for very long. The life of a troblin is short and brutal, and only the strongest and meanest survive to adulthood. Troblin children that misbehave or speak out against the current tribe chieftain are usually thrown into cooking fires and eaten by its betters. Any troblin that has become so deformed and twisted by multiple regenerative mishaps that it is no longer of use to the tribe generally receive the same fate. The leadership of a troblin tribe is determined by might alone, so combat prowess and strength are required of troblin that would dare call itself chief. Troblin Characters Troblin clerics have access to the Chaos and Evil domains, but clerics are rare in this outcast and wretched race. Most troblin spellcasters are adepts or sorcerers. Troblin characters possess the following racial traits. Strength +6, Dexterity +2, Constitution +4, Intelligence -2, Charisma -4. Darkvision: Troblins can see in the dark out to 60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: A troblin begins with three levels of humanoid, which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +1.

Troglodyte,1,humanoid,underground,"This humanoid's scaly hide is dull gray. Its frame resembles that of a cave lizard, with a long tail and crests on its head and back.","The troglodyte is a feral, savage cave dweller. They are among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above or below ground, yet for all their race's fecundity and sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic raids, and bitter civil wars. The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the fact that their empire was once among the largest in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid races-while those races hid in caves and worshiped fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly civilized, they outstripped their onetime troglodyte oppressors. Today, the roles have changed-now it is the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of a feral savage. Religion is strong among troglodyte tribes, and their shamans and priests are universally the highest regarded members of a clan. A troglodyte chieftain is not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind . A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",400
Troll,5,humanoid,cold mountains,"This tall creature has rough, green hide. Its hands end in claws, and its bestial face has a hideous, tusked underbite.","Trolls possess incredibly sharp claws and amazing regenerative powers, allowing them to recover from nearly wound. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, and astonishingly strong-combined with their claws, their strength allows them to literally tear apart flesh to feed their voracious appetites. Trolls stand about 14 feet tall, but their hunched postures often make them appear shorter. An adult troll weighs around 1,000 pounds. A troll's appetite and its regenerative powers make it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge headlong at the nearest living creature and attack with all of its fury. Only fire seems to cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal threat is not enough to stop a troll's advance. Those who commonly battle with trolls know to locate and burn pieces after a fight, for even the smallest scrap of flesh can regrow a full-size troll given enough time. Fortunately, only the largest part of a troll regrows in this way. Despite their cruelty in combat, trolls are surprisingly tender and kind to their own young. Female trolls work as a group, spending a great deal of time teaching young trolls to hunt and fend for themselves before sending them off to find their own territories. A male troll tends to live a solitary existence, partnering with a female for only a brief time to mate. All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation. Due to this need, most trolls stake out large territories as their own, and fights between rivals are quite common. While these are usually nonlethal, trolls are aware of each others' weaknesses and will use such knowledge to kill their own kind if food is scarce. Scrags Dwelling in both fresh and salt waters, these cousins of the troll have the waters subtype and the amphibious special quality. Scrags have a base land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet. A scrag's regeneration ability only works if it is in contact with waters. Scrags dwell in body of waters in climate, though they are most common in cold northern rivers and lakes, and are less bestial in appearance than their terrestrial cousins, though no less violent.",1600
Trollhound,3,magical beast,cold mountains,"Foul-smelling fluids ooze from weeping sores across the scaly skin of this squat, powerful, and vaguely canine beast.","Slavering and voracious, trollhounds seem to be trolls in smaller canine form, and indeed, are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of trolls. Requiring vast amounts of food to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds range far and wide through the mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume prey they can track down and kill. A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, has short but powerful legs, and weighs around 350 pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws with a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange. Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's wicked intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the most grievous wounds, except those inf licted by fire or acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by trolls. Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it poses. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound flesh can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast. Trollhounds are most often found in the compof trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their savage masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack a troll without cause-although trolls often enjoy violent roughhousing with these creatures nonetheless.",800

When lawful good deities have the need to communicate directly with a group of mortals, they often send trumpet archons to act as their intermediaries. Trumpet archons speak with clear, musical voices. Their otherworldly eyes are white and pupilless.

Tsathar,2,monstrous humanoid,underground or temperate marshes,"This vile creature resembles an upright, humanoid frog with gray flesh and reddish-gold eyes. Its humanoid arms end in wicked claws.","Tsathar  are a race of froglike humanoids that dwell in fetid swamps and dark caverns deep beneath the earth. They worship a strange and terrifying demonic being known as Tsathogga, and often hunt down and capture individuals of other humanoid races to serve as sacrifices or victims in their foul breeding pits. Tsathar prefer to use short, barbed spears and kukri-like daggers in combat. They sometimes employ nets as well. They charge into combat with maniacal fury, and rarely use elaborate tactics, unless a scourge or priest is present to control them. They favor leather armor crafted from the hides of the frogs they breed. Priests favor the wicked kukri in battle. Scourges prefer to loose their servant frogs on opponents, allowing common tsathar soldiers to engage opponents hand-to-hand. This is not to say that they are not capable fighters, for they certainly are. They favor barbed shortspears, twisted kukri-like daggers, and light armor such as leather or studded leather. They also often carry nets to snare their charges or foes. If their frogs are in danger, they leap in with their spears and attack. A typical tsathar stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. A tsathar scourge is slightly bulkier, of equivalent height but weighing about 350 pounds. Tsathar Society Tsathar prefer to live in fetid lairs deep underground or in dark swamps. When they dwell above ground, they are nocturnal. Some few surfacedwelling tsathar have joined cults of assassins. Tsathar communities are led by priests-common tsathar with levels of cleric or oracle. They revere the demon-god Tsathogga, a foul toadlike demonic being that grants them access to the Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and waters domains, and the Catastrophe and Demon subdomains. Tsathar are sexless and reproduce by implanting an egg into a host, which can be form of living creature. Normally, creatures are captured or bred to serve as hosts-dire rats and giant frogs being common hosts.

Tsathar scourges never become priests and thus do not have the summoning ability common tsathars can attain.

Its eyes are red and glow with an inherent evil. The creature's massive mouth sports rows of sharpened teeth, each at least as long as a sword.","This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than he does about obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and decay that he represents. He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth. Tsathogga makes his home on both Tarterus and the Abyss, spending equal amounts of time in both places. His lair is a vast swamps of filth deposited by the rivers Styx as it flows between the two planes. Tsathogga's main form is of a colossally-bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs and fingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul oils and fluids, which leak into the vile swamps in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that all of the slime and filth from the rivers Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy maw. He rarely moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible shrieking. Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures, notably his own vile frog race, the tsathar . Tsathogga is 60 feet long and 40 feet tall. He weighs about 200 tons. Tsathogga prefers to avoid direct combat simply because he usually has better things to do than waste time killing the latest group of would-be demon killers. If threatened or attacked, he usually summons his minions to battle his opponents. If Tsathogga does enter combat, he almost always begins by striking the nearest opponent with his tongue, pulling that foe in and swallowing him. If he is near the muck and filth that permeates his home plane, he likes to dive or bury himself underneath it so if a swallowed opponent does manage to cut his way out of Tsathogga's gullet, he usually drowns or suffocates before he sees daylight again. Servants of Tsathogga Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of Tsathogga are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil with Tsathogga.

It is a very aggressive predator and hunter, though it can sustain itself by scavenging. Its preferred food is fresh, raw meat. Tunnel worms are very aggressive and attack anything that enters their territory. Tunnel worms live in mazelike complexes of burrows connected by passages they have chewed out over time; these burrows are often filled with the rotting remains of past prey, used by the worm to incubate its offspring. The favored tactic of the tunnel worm is to lurk beneath the surface of the ground or behind a wall until it senses a creature moving by, whereupon it burrows out to surprise and attack its prey .

Tuyewera,4,undead,any,"The figure that crawls up from the grave may have once been a living man, but it is now wholly a monster. Its flesh crawls with worms and seeps with decay, allowing bones and internal organs to slip through hideous tears here and there. Its jaw distends and a long tongue whips out, almost like a tentacle. Its legs have been severed at the knee, forcing it to scrabble forward on all fours like some deranged beast.","The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy's lair to perform number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead-in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their tongues to repeat the process. Variant Tuyeweras The statistics presented on the facing page are for a typical tuyewera created from the body of a Medium humanoid creature, but there are methods by which tuyeweras can be created from the bodies of smaller or larger humanoids as well. While in theory, one should be able to create a tuyewera from a non-humanoid creature, so far necromancers have been unable to achieve this feat. Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used simply doesn't translate to non-humanoid bodies-although the unique undead created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly tuyeweras.

Smaller Tuyeweras: Tuyeweras created from the bodies of gnomes, half lings, or even children of larger humanoids can be statted up by applying the young creature simple template. Larger Tuyeweras: A tuyewera created from the body of a giant can be Large or larger. You can simply apply the giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its stats-whenever a tuyewera's Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it increases its Charisma score. A Large tuyewera has 10 HD and is CR 6. A Huge one has 14 HD and is CR 8. A Gargantuan one has 18 HD and is CR 11. The largest, Colossal tuyeweras, have 22 HD and are CR 14. Creating a Tuyeweras A tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse's tongue and severing its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster to anoint the tuyewera's severed limbs and tongue with special medicines. These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and tongue . When the spell is complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera's burnt limbs and tongue on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes them and seeks out its creator unerringly  and attempts to kill him- preferably as the creator sleeps.",1200
Twigjack,3,fey,temperate forests,"This tiny, vaguely humanoid creature seems to be made completely of bundles of sticks wound with thorny vines.","Deep in old-growth forests, twigjacks spend their time tormenting intruders and wreaking havoc on settlers. Maladjusted protectors of the wood, these malicious fey constantly threaten attempts to civilize the wild. Twigjacks delight in breaking wagon wheels from expansionists' caravans, snapping hunters' bows, and sabotaging isolated cabins and villages. Although they possess a keen intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find twigjacks bothersome, and resent suggestion that they are related. Equally, twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud of their fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time. But some spriggans, quicklings, and other evil fey associate with twigjacks, and while goblins fear and distrust the creatures, bugbears often bully them into service. Gnarled sticks bundled by vines and brambles form a twigjack's entire body. Atop its head, a mossy growth not unlike hair sprouts. The creature's eyes appear as vacant dark knotholes, and its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body.",800
Two-headed Troll,7,humanoid,underground,"The most discernible feature of this massive brute is its two heads. Its hide is mottled green-gray and covered in coarse, dark hair. Each head is identical: red eyes, drooping nose, and yellow fangs. Its arms and legs end in razor-sharpened claws.","The two-headed troll is thought to be the hideous offspring of an ettin and female troll. Sages contend that no other explanation is possible concerning this monster. Two-headed trolls prefer to make their lairs underground and away from civilization. Although believed to be the offspring of an ettin and troll, they do not associate with the former, but are often found leading the latter during raids or wars. A two-headed troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Its hide is mottled green or gray, and its facial features resemble that of a standard troll. Two-headed trolls typically dress in rags or tattered clothes or even battered and rusted armor on occasion. Their legs end in three-toed feet, and their powerful arms end in sharpened claws. The two-headed troll has the slow moving gait of the normal troll, but does not walk hunched over.

Tzitzimitl,19,undead,any,"Crusted with rock, this immense skeletal figure flies swiftly through the air, strange gasses clinging to its nightmarish form.","Enigmatic creatures of darkness, some cultures claim tzitzimitls attack and consume entire suns to ""shut down worlds"" in preparation for the end of days. Sages say that these creatures come from the cold, dark places between the stars, and that in the darkness of eclipse, one can see their immense, world-darkening shadows. Some claim ancient and forgotten deities of death and destruction created the first tzitzimitls as instruments of apocalypse, while others speculate they come from faraway worlds where immense planets teem with creatures of this scale, and that the immortal dead of these dark globes are banished to other worlds to spread devastation. Tzitzimitls as a whole offer neither affirmation nor denial for these claims, and in fact seem to glory in such legends. Certainly, the arrival of a tzitzimitl upon a world heralds the advent of a time of great trouble, although whether or not the tzitzimitl actually presages such dark times or is the cause of them is a matter of debate. On some planets, tzitzimitls have already arrived, yet they lie dormant in ancient tombs, imprisoned ages ago by heroes who are long forgotten today. A tzitzimitl is 50 feet tall.",204800

Ubue,2,humanoid,temperate hills or mountains,"The creature looks like an ashen-skinned homely giant dressed in ragged animal hides. It has three heads, three arms, and three legs. Its mouths are filled with broken and rotten teeth.","Ubues are a bizarre race that is among the rarest of intelligent races. They are so rare, in fact, that most people believe their existence to be only legend. At first sight, madventurers assume that ubues are a race of three-headed ettins or trolls. Adventurers who have actually seen these strange creatures claim that the middle head of an ubue is a different sex from the other two. This is not true, however, and is in fact merely a side effect of the bizarre biology of these creatures. Ubues are very primitive and clothe themselves in unfinished animal hides, weave bones and sticks into their hair, and utilize only the crudest of tools and weapons. Ubues attack with savage brutality as if in an animalistic rage. Ubue Society Ubues have a very primitive social system: simply put, the strongest male of ubue tribe is the leader. Any adult male ubue has the right to challenge the tribal leader in a non-lethal ritual combat-usually a wrestling match or other test of strength. If the challenger loses, he is banished from the tribe for a period of one full year. His immediate family is also banished with him: ubues cannot tolerate weakness. Should the leader be deposed, he becomes an elder of the tribe and acts as an advisor to the new leader. Female ubues usually give birth to only a single child. If twins are born to an ubue couple, this is seen as an ill omen: thus, one child is slain by the tribal shaman as a sacrifice to their god. The shaman casts bones or sticks to determine which child is to be the sacrifice. Because ubue society is strongly male-dominated, if one twin is male and the other female, it will always be the female child that is sacrificed. Ubue Characters Ubues are simple thinkers, and prefer simple choices when advancing in a class, particularly favoring the barbarian and fighter classes. All ubues have the following racial traits. +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma: Ubues are sturdy and powerful creatures. Large Size: -1 penalty to AC, -1 penalty to attack rolls, -4 penalty on Stealth checks, +1 bonus on CMB and CMD, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium creatures. Space/Reach: 10 ft./10 ft. Low-Light Vision: Ubues can see twice as far as humans in dimly lit conditions. All-Around Vision: Because each head thinks independently, ubues can see in all directions, and can't be flanked. Racial Hit Dice: An ubue begins with three levels of humanoid, which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +1, and Will +1. Racial Skills: An ubue's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 3 x . Racial Feats: An ubue's humanoid levels give it two feats. AC: +6 natural armor bonus.

Ugash-iram,15,magical beast,all,"This immense creature resembles a horrific, twelve-armed squid. Its emerald eyes burn with a terrifying malignance, and the thing has a fanged maw where its beak should be.","South of Jalmeray, deep in the Yogisa Trench in the middle of the Obari oceans, the terrifying gutaki known as Ugash-Iram lords over the underwaters city of Achom. Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy brief ly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants. Because of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari oceans, few surface-dwellers know of Ugash- Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwaters regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless waters cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwaters cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power. Those waters creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwaters metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari oceans and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira. Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its inf luence spreads even further. Infamous Deeds The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few waters humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles. One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers. While ships crossing the middle of the Obari oceans face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the waters horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwaters and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon. Adventure Hooks Tracking Ugash-Iram down is not a task for the faint of heart, and those who do manage to find the vile underwaters metropolis of Achom would do well to stay away. Despite the danger, adventurers might find number of reasons to explore the foul settlement and face its cruel inhabitants. • A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo, merchants send word to ports along the Obari oceans's shores, searching for a group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives. • Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and other non-evil waters creatures recently formed a congress to address the gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost within the Obari oceans south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of Achom. The waters council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the item.",51200
Ukobach,4,Outsider,Hell,"The light of a flaming pitchfork illuminates a creepily malformed little man, his red skin scarred and raw like the victim of horrific burns. Although barely taller than a child, his features mock those of a terrible old man with an oversized head, knife-like nose, and crazed round eyes flickering with wild flames.","Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions. Ukobachs stand approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies. Ecology Born from the burning depths of Hell, ukobachs find themselves most at home amid the choking and sultry pits where mortals dare not delve, proving well adapted to such stifling environs. While they must breathe, they prove equally well adapted to breathing smoke, cinders, and steam as air. Like all devils, the ukobachs' infernal eyes gaze through even the most stygian night, but unlike their brethren, they dislike the dark. While they harbor no fear of darkness and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion of flame. Habitat & Society Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon, creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love of such creations. On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities. While mmetropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches, finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other places likely to survive the occasional errant flame. While indisputably pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames, exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation. Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook more devious ambushes. These impish devils understand the use of flammable fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol, heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their creations. Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of creating berith, an alchemical element by which material might be distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in a golden coffin. Summoning Ukobachs Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when it comes to answering the summons of mdiabolists, especially those with an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the inventions of Hell. Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder, increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap by +2. Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire. In addition, ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a summoner toward a destructive end. Commonly, such infernal gifts take the form of fireworks and explosives-especially in lands where such creations are uncommon-inscrutable blueprints or formulas for fiendish devices or magic items, or powerfully volatile alchemical reagents.",1200
Ulfen Raider,0.5,humanoid,any,This fur-clad and fiercely rugged barbarian stands ready to do battle with a deadly looking battleaxe clenched in one hand.,"Raiders from the Linnorm Kingdoms seek to prove themselves by sailing to distant lands and returning with riches, either obtained by shrewd trading or taken as plunder from a successful raid. All raiders seek to show their courage in battle, fighting fiercely for pillage or honor. While raiding, these barbarians employ the element of surprise; in the faint predawn light, they quietly row their longship with muff led oars as they draw near the targeted settlement. Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition. After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate high-pedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village's able-bodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season. In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders.",200
Umasi,4,monstrous humanoid,tropical jungles,"An emaciated humanoid bursts through the trees, brandishing a knife of black stone. His body is a patchwork of hair, skin, scales, and strange limbs stitched together with thick, black thread.","Reclusive and shrouded in mystery, the Umasi-or Harvestmen, as they are known across the Mwangi Expanse-are a race of humanoids who exist between life and death. Unable to heal or procreate naturally, the Umasi extend their lives by transplanting the skin, organs, or even entire appendages of other humanoids onto parts of their own bodies. As a result, there is no typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes. The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall. Most weigh between 150 and 300 pounds, and the constant addition of new flesh has left little distinction between genders. Ecology Zenj legends say the Umasi were an ancient tribe of arrogant scholars who lived deep in the Mwangi jungles. When a powerful witch doctor came to the Umasi seeking their wisdom, he was rebuffed as being unworthy of receiving the Umasi's knowledge. Enraged, the witch doctor used a taboo ritual to curse the Umasi, stealing away fragments of their very souls and binding them to the flesh of others, forcing them to harvest the bodies of humanoids to sustain a bitterly extended existence. This curse left the Umasi a sterile, aff licted people somewhere between the living and the living dead. Contrary to their appearance, Umasi are living creatures. They eat, breathe, and sleep like other humanoids, but their bodies are in a constant state of decay. This divided nature grants the Harvestmen immunity to disease and resistance to toxins, but even minor injuries don't heal naturally; Umasi must graft new flesh onto existing tissue to heal their wounds. Staving off the endless decay of their bodies requires more extreme measures. As limbs and organs rot, Umasi elders use obsidian blades to remove the subject's decaying parts, replacing them with similar parts from fresh corpses and linking the replacements to the original body through a complex ritual combining ancient Umasi knowledge with the forbidden juju rites of their original curser. When the ritual is complete, the new body part joins perfectly with the Umasi and death is cheated… for a time. In much the same way, Harvestmen are not born, but made. Barren, infertile, and missing pieces of their souls, Umasi are unable to breed. Their only recourse is to tear off chunks of their own flesh, bind them together with the remains of dead humanoids, and animate the results using the same ancient juju rites. Mpeople have sought the secret to the longevity of the Harvestmen, only to be turned away with little explanation. Because the joining ritual requires one to give away a part of his soul willingly, the Umasi only accept those ready to make such a dire compact because they have no other choice. The Harvestmen only give their ""gift"" to humanoids who find themselves at the edge of death, whether from a grievous wound or some magically resistant aff liction or disease. During the ritual, a piece of the dying humanoid is exchanged with a corresponding piece of an Umasi ""donor."" Once the stitches are sewn, the dying creature's wounds are healed, and he joins the ranks of the Harvestmen forevermore. Habitat and Society Umasi society is as much a patchwork as its members. Some live off the jungles, hunting and farming as they did before the curse. Other tribes lead sedentary lives, trading ancient artifacts of the first Umasi with explorers in exchange for needed goods. Umasi have no organized leadership or traditional families, and children are unheard of among their kind. Regardless, all Umasi tribes form around a council of elders. While some Umasi still dwell deep in the Mwangi junglesamid the skeletal ruins of their former kingdom, the majority of the Harvestmen have spread to the Kaava Lands and the Screaming jungles, distancing themselves from the memory of their curse. Umasi are reclusive wherever they dwell, preferring to stay on the fringes of settlements. Although they need humanoid flesh to survive, most Umasi kill only as a last resort, taking flesh from the newly dead instead. This practice often stigmatizes them further, with other races considering them little more than grave robbers. A few Umasi embrace their near immortality in a darker way, viewing other humanoids as prey. These Harvestmen roam the Bandu hills with undead ghouls, hunting travelers and harvesting what they wish, sometimes before their victims are even dead. However, some Umasi use their peculiar nature to live harmoniously with other humanoids. Pathfinders tell of human villages where Umasi act as gravediggers during plague outbreaks. Their immunity to disease allows the Harvestmen to safely dispose of infected corpses, while at the same time gaining the flesh they need and also garnering goodwill from those they help. Harvestmen rarely fight with other races, but competition over resources like waters or hunting grounds can cause conf lict, and those knowingly trespassing on Umasi land may court their anger. When driven to combat, Umasi are extremely dangerous, laying ambushes for enemies and swarming their targets in the hope of harvesting their strength. With their obsidian blades, Harvestmen can punch through the chest cavities of helpless or dying humanoids to extract vital organs. Any Umasi who consumes these pieces of their victims gains a ferocious surge of power, turning the tide of even a desperate battle. All Harvestmen know the heavy price they pay to cheat death. Some, over the lonely centuries, have come to regret their existence, roaming the lengths of the Mwangi Expanse and beyond in search of powerful magic to free them from their curse. Sadly, no mortal magic has yet proven strong enough to undo the fell curse of the Umasi.",1200
Umbral Shepherd,5,outsider,any,This mass of shadow possesses a horrific demon face. Several writhing tentacles sprout from its grublike body.,"Umbral shepherds are parasitic entities eternally devoted to Zon-Kuthon. Brought forth onto Golarion primarily by the shadowcallers of Pangolais in Nidal, the evil creatures relish the chance to infest host bodies and use these vessels to further the work of their dark master. Those infested by such creatures are identifiable primarily by their pure-black eyes and fervor for the Midnight Lord, as well as the slow decay of their bodies. Umbral shepherds also serve as specialized torturers, with their ability to create bloodless cavities and tunnels through a prisoner's body with a touch of their horrible, burrowing tentacles. Whether Zon-Kuthon created the umbral shepherds or simply discovered and adopted them into his faith is unclear, but the shadowy parasites are irreversibly linked to both him and their home plane. Though they lust for the chance to spread their worship elsewhere, exposure to the light and energy of other planes is extremely harmful to them, thus necessitating the use of host bodies. Umbral shepherds value their hosts as vehicles but ultimately see them as disposable, knowing that without powerful magic their vessels will gradually sicken and die. An umbral shepherd that believes its vessel is close to death almost always abandons it rather than risking death itself, and usually transfers to a new host. In their natural state, umbral shepherds are shaped like limbless, demon-faced humans made of coherent shadow, and are capable of spawning number of tentacles of varying sizes. Some religious scholars believe that the first Joyful Things may have been attempts by Kuthites to change themselves into something closer to the shepherds, yet this remains the unsubstantiated speculation of outsiders.",1600
Umdhlebi,12,plant,tropical forests or jungles,"What appeared at first glance to be the decaying husk of an enormous tree erupts into motion, as thick tendrils reach outward hungrily from all sides. Amid the jumble of motion, a subconscious whisper promises sleep and sweet rest to that lie down at the thing's base.","Umdhlebis are massive, intelligent, and carnivorous plants that take root in jungles. Their outer shell is brown and resembles the thick bark of a dead tree, while concealing the softer layer of green cellulose beneath. When they flower, umdhlebis grow broad, fragile-looking crimson leaves with sharp, grasping edges. Umdhlebis draw their prey close with mind-affecting suggestions, enticing would-be victims to rest at the plant's base, and then strike with their vine-like tendrils, each as thick as a man's forearm. Umdhlebis grow to almost 20 feet in height, but can be shorter or taller depending on the surrounding vegetation. An umdhlebi's trunk ranges from 3 to 5 feet in diameter, and the plant as a whole weighs over 10,000 pounds. Umdhlebis can live for up to 50 years. Ecology Legends say that the first umdhlebi was created when an assassin vine crawled into the hollow corpse of a slain, jungles-dwelling treant. The creatures fused together, returning the treant to life, but instilling in it a devastating hunger. Regardless of its true origins, the umdhlebi is known and feared throughout the jungles of the world. Resembling a tree with a hard outer coating, the umdhlebi is actually an intelligent and mobile plant, capable of uprooting itself to find food or escape danger. Although ambulatory, the umdhlebi is too slow to truly hunt and has evolved several methods to attract prey. An umdhlebi uses its large vines and brightly colored leaves to draw in animals and other creatures of lesser intelligence. Once in range, the umdhlebi lashes out with its strong, vine-like tendrils, enveloping and crushing its prey with bone-shattering force. Umdhlebis, however, prefer to feed on humanoids and can compel even the most strongminded individuals to approach their waiting snares. When sensing a nearby humanoid, an umdhlebi vibrates rows of fine, cilia-like hairs along its trunk, producing a sound that targets the minds of close enough to hear it. This enticing drone causes those under its sway to approach the base of the tree where the umdhlebi can strike. Although the majority of an umdhlebi grows aboveground, the creature's mouth and digestive system are just below the surface. Large, thick roots at the base provide stability and allow for movement, but between these larger roots and beneath the umdhlebi's central trunk exists a populous network of long, thin stems. Each of these growths ends in double-sided fronds lined with spine-like teeth, similar to the leaves of a flytrap. When an umdhlebi roots itself to the ground, these stems burrow up to breach the surrounding earth, forming a moss-like border around the larger roots. Fresh kills are thus devoured from beneath, as the umdhlebi's understems feed. Numbering in the thousands, the umdhlebi's tiny mouths can strip a human carcass to its bones in under an hour, and although these under-stems are too small to effectively damage foes in melee, their shifting, undulating motion of makes traversing the ground around an umdhlebi difficult. Umdhlebis produce a spiny red fruit twice a year. This fruit appears similar to the seed pods of chestnut trees, but instead of holding tough seeds, it contains a bland meat riddled with dozens of triangular seeds. While wellfed umdhlebis sometimes allow monkeys and birds to pluck their fruit and carry it to new ground, they often use their own tendrils to pick and fling the fruit where they please. Some stories tell of undhlebis braining wanderers with these dense pods, or of passersby warned of the dangerous plants by their flying fruit, but these seasonal growths never reliably serve as weapons or warnings. Some tribes maintain dangerous traditions of seeking out and collecting undhlebi fruit to use in the creation of mashes or alcohols. Such products possess a distinctive dry-bitter taste and so are only prepared for use in coming-of-age rituals or other rites of passage. Habitat & Society Umdhlebis root themselves along roads and watersways near humanoid settlements whenever possible. As their roots are highly sensitive to vibrations and can detect the movement of other nearby creatures, they can stay out of sight, despite their size, and still be aware of their surroundings. As the dry shell of their outer layer is particularly susceptible to fire, umdhlebis always entwine themselves with surrounding foliage so that such attacks against them also risk setting the entire wilderness ablaze. If threatened and such cover is not available, umdhlebis use their compelling whisper ability to manipulate one or more opponents and then draw them in to surround the plant's trunk, using them as living shields. Although they have no use for treasure, umdhlebis pile leftover items from their prey into the base of their trunks as bait for passersby. When an umdhlebi moves on to other hunting grounds, it sheds its fruit first, hoping that the seeds will take hold and grow. Denizens of the Mwangi Expanse and other jungles are taught to recognize and burn umdhlebi seeds from an early age. Nevertheless, some umdhlebi seeds do make their way into the earth and take root, reaching maturity with frightening speed.",19200
Undead Ningyo,1,undead,waters or land,The repulsively fused features of a dried fish and desiccated humanoid combine in these monstrous remains. The crackle of tiny grinding bones and the hiss of parched scales whisper with every motion as the snarling miniature mummy drags its shriveled corpse forward.,"The bane of fishermen and divers, ningyos lurk in tropical waters, gorging themselves on fish and attacking anything they can sink their tiny fangs into. Nasty little things, these primitive, miniature mer-monsters are bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out of both blind ravenousness and blunt stupidity. With little more organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling teeth. Yet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for their unquiet deaths. Said by natives to be too mean and stupid to die, a slain ningyo always returns to life by night, obliviously adopting old habits or dragging itself forth from the waters to find its killer. By day, though, undead ningyos turn back into normal corpses, sometimes washing up on shore as gruesome and fascinating-but potentially deadly-curiosities. While the knowledgeable burn the eerie corpses they find along the coast, more than one foolhardy beachcomber has collected such an oddity, only to later awake in terror, the tiny withered claws and broken teeth of his weird curio savaging him in the dark. Ningyos measure approximately 2 to 2-1/2 feet long from head to tail, and weigh 6 to 9 pounds. Ningyos on Golarion Ningyos have harassed and terrorized those dwelling along warm coastlines for ages, proving most common along the west coast of Garund and the eastern shores of Arcadia. Well informed by the native folklore of those areas, most locals easily avoid and deal with the nasty mer-creatures. Visitors and invaders of such areas, though, are rarely so well informed. The Fetching Fishwife: This saltencrusted beach house-turned-inn teeters on a rocky beach a short ride north of Eleder. Popular with visitors and those seeking to escape the city's roughand- tumble confusion, the Fishwife offers fine rooms, good food, and a collection of eclectic decor- from bestial trophies and wall mountings to native artistry. It also bears a curse. Four guests and two owners have met gruesome deaths in the inn, and the most recent landlord quietly fled Sargava, leaving the keys to the house and a tiny, withered claw to his estranged brother. Kimbal Pall, the current owner, now runs the tavern, having no idea he holds a piece of an undead ningyo lurking in his collection. Treasure at Bloodcove: The treacherous inlets southwest of Bloodcove have long been a favorite stop for Shackles pirates, those with both booty to bury and plots to pillage the Kaava Lands' coastlines tribes. Recently, a masked shaman has been sighted wandering between these coves, attended by a large, murderous swarm of ningyos. Although the witch doctor seems to only feed the nasty sea monsters fish heads and bird carcasses, they obey her every command, driving off the curious as they endlessly scour the sea floor, as if for some unknown treasure.",400
Undead Ooze,6,undead,underground,"This creature appears as a large, undulating mass of black goo from which rotted and broken bones protrude.","When an ooze moves across the grave of a restless and evil soul, a transformation takes place. The malevolent spirit, still tied to the rotting flesh consumed by the ooze, melds with the ooze. The result is a creature filled with hatred of the living and an intelligence and cunningness not normally known among its kind. The undead ooze has an advantage over other ooze: intelligence. It uses this new gift to its fullest in combat by attacking from surprise or by stalking its prey and attacking when the opportunity presents itself. The undead ooze attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It usually engulfs its foes or expels its skeleton allies to contend with its enemies.

Undine,0.5,outsider,land,"This blue-haired, blue-skinned man moves with a liquid grace. His ears are fin-like, and his hands and feet are webbed.","Undines are humans whose ancestry includes elemental beings of waters, such as marids. This connection with the Plane of waters is most noticeably manifested in their coloration, which tends to mimic that of lakes or oceans-all undines have limpid, blue eyes, and their skin and hair can range from pale blue-white to the deep blue or green of the sea. Undine Characters Undines are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Undines have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength: Undines are both perceptive and agile, but tend to adapt rather than match force with force.

Unfettered Eidolon,8,outsider,any,"This bizarre amalgam of monstrous parts rampages forth, an eldritch rune seared upon its forehead.","An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally, however, this link between eidolon and summoner is unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home realm, and munfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing runes that once represented their bonds burning painful scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own. CREATING AN UNFETTERED EIDOLON Unfettered eidolons can take on mshapes and sizes. The stats presented here are for a Medium unfettered eidolon with the serpentine base form and 15 evolution points, but an eidolon can take almost form. An unfettered eidolon has one of four base forms: waters, biped, quadruped, or serpentine. Each base form determines an eidolon's speed, good and bad saves, and ability scores, and allots 5 evolution points to starting evolutions . Each base form starts at Medium size. An unfettered eidolon can increase to Large size or larger by spending additional evolution points . waters Base Form: Speed 20 ft., swim 40 ft.; Saves Fort , Ref , Will ; Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Starting Evolutions bite, gills, improved natural armor, swim .

An unfettered eidolon begins with 1 Hit Die, a +2 natural armor bonus, and the evasion ability. As an unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase , it gains additional bonuses and abilities. At 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon's base armor bonus increases by +2. This bonus may be split between an armor bonus and a natural armor bonus. Also at 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to both its Strength and Dexterity scores. At 5 Hit Dice, and every 4 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to one of its ability scores. At 7 Hit Dice, an unfettered eidolon gains Multiattack as a bonus feat. Evolution Points Unfettered eidolons have a number of evolution points  you can use to purchase abilities and defenses in addition to those presented above. An unfettered eidolon starts with 8 EP, regardless of its base form. For each additional EP spent beyond 8, an unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase by 1. An unfettered eidolon's CR increases with its Hit Dice, as outlined on Table 1-2 on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary using the ""outsider"" line.

Unicorn,3,magical beast,temperate forests,"This magnificent beast looks like a white horse, but with a goat's beard and a single long ivory horn on its brow.","Unicorns are fierce, intelligent creatures of the forests, noble beasts who keep their own counsel and typically appear only to defend their homes against evil. They universally shun all creatures except for good-aligned fey, good-aligned humanoid women, and the woodlands' native animals, though they may fight alongside other good creatures against common enemies. A typical unicorn is 8 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing 1,200 pounds. Unicorns mate for life, and the pairs generally make their homes in specific glades or dells within the vast forests they protect . They allow good and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, or reside in their woods unharmed, but evil creatures and those who damage the local ecosystem more than necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging are swiftly driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone else-such as a lover or child-giving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins. A unicorn's horn is the focus for its powers, and in order to use its spell-like abilities on other creatures the unicorn must touch them with it. Evil creatures greatly value unicorn horns as reagents for healing potions and other dark rites, and a single powdered unicorn horn counts as 1,600 gp when used as a component for crafting healing magic.",800
Uniila,10,outsider,any,"The curves of a shapely maiden define the outline of a mysterious figure wrapped in mist and strips of ancient robes. From beneath the rune-embroidered tatters stretch four, corpse-pale arms, each bearing either a blade or some mysterious arcane device. Hidden within the cowl of its hood shimmer the faintest outlines of a veiled face and a pair of eyes flickering with barely restrained energy.","The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even that of mgreater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of his own doing than overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety. Summoning Cabal Devils Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know , or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent ""masters"" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.",9600
Upasunda,9,outsider,any,"This six-armed woman has three fanged faces on her head. She wears colorful robes, and her hands wield several exotic weapons.","Upasundas, also called beatific ones, are asuras who devote themselves to martial meditations and physical perfection. Upasundas seek monklike poise and skill, and through it, the ability to deal flawless destruction wherever they go. Their nickname suggests purity, and indeed, each beatific one is an expression of asura purity through devotion to the ideal of annihilation. It is believed that the first upasundas were created from the jealous followers of a man who achieved divinity through his own force of will. Those of his followers who felt abandoned when this new deity ascended to the Great Beyond sought other ways to achieve immortality, and fell pray to one of the asura ranas, who granted them their desire by transforming them into beatific ones. Upasundas never surrender to foes in combat and rarely flee from battle. They hope to increase in skill and wisdom or to die in battle. On either path lies evolution toward a greater understanding of destruction in its countless forms. An upasunda is 7 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.",6400

They have developed mstrange weapons, but none are more iconic than the two-bladed rhoka sword. Rhoka swords are exotic onehanded melee weapons-all urdefhans are proficient in their use. With such weapons, an urdefhan seeks to inf lict as much death as possible upon the world before it perishes, so that its daemonic lords are pleased. Most male urdefhans are sterile-as a result, the women often turn to conjured daemons for mates. The products of such unions are usually typical urdefhans, but sometimes result in half-fiend urdefhans-these monsters usually rise to positions of great power in their violent society.",800
Valkyrie,12,outsider,any,"Surrounded by lightning, this impressive female warrior wears a gleaming golden breastplate and carries a shining spear.","Valkyries are outsiders who scour the battlefields of the Material Plane for warriors of great prowess and legendary renown.

Valkyries are always female, and appear as strong and beautiful human, dwarven, or elven women. A human valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds. Valkyries serve a variety of deities, though they are most often associated with the gods of war, conf lict, valor, and courage.

Vampire,9,undead,any,"This alluring, raven-haired beauty casually wipes a trickle of blood from a pale cheek, then smiles to reveal needle-sharp fangs.","Vampires are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They look much as they did in life, often becoming more attractive, though some have a hardened, feral look instead. Creating a Vampire ""Vampire"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice . Most vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead . Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form  and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed.  Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Weaknesses: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it . However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running waters inf licts damage on a vampire equal to onethird of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it . However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy waters. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running waters. Melee: A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire's size . Its slam also causes energy drain . Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A vampire gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain : A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour  each round it drains blood. Children of the Night : Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action.  These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour. Create Spawn : A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again. Dominate : A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's inf luence, as though by a dominate person spell . The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain : A creature hit by a vampire's slam  gains two negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire makes. Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following. Change Shape : A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape II. Gaseous Form : As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will , but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Shadowless : A vampire casts no shadows and shows no ref lection in a mirror. Spider Climb : A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Ability Scores Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score. Skills Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Ref lexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Ref lexes, and Toughness as bonus feats. Vampire Spawn A vampire can elect to create a vampire spawn instead of a full-f ledged vampire when she uses her create spawn ability on a humanoid creature only. This decision must be made as a free action whenever a vampire slays an appropriate creature by using blood drain or energy drain. A vampire spawn's statistics are identical to those of a wight, save for the following changes. • It gains the blood drain and dominate vampire special attacks. • It gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/silver, resist cold and electricity 10, fast healing 2, and the vampire qualities listed above . • It does not gain the Create Spawn ability. • A vampire spawn gains all of the standard vampire weaknesses. • A vampire spawn is CR 4.",6400

Vampiric Mist,3,aberration,temperate or warm swamps or underground,"A cloud of crimson vapor reeking of fresh blood hangs in the air, reaching out with lashing claws.","Often mistaken for a vampire in gaseous form or an unusual type of air elemental, the vampiric mist is in fact a strange form of aberrant life. With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, this creature dwells in swamps or moist underground regions where its vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern. Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes form into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Much of a vampiric mist's time is spent seeking prey-a pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The creatures' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, mvampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use foolish tactics- such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.",800
Vampiric Ooze,8,undead,underground,"This creature looks like a thick, bubbling pool of mustard yellow muck or goo.","The vampiric ooze is thought to have been created by a great undead spellcaster using ancient and forbidden magic. Some believe the vampiric ooze was formed when an ochre jelly slew a vampire and absorbed it. It can alter its shape so as to appear up to 12 feet long and 6 inches thick; it can also compress its body to slip through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. It spends its time slithering along floors, walls, and ceilings, or if above ground, hunting its prey at night. A vampiric ooze attempts to envelop and constrict its prey, dealing negative levels with its slam attack. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",4800
Vanara,0.5,humanoid,forests,"This lean, simian humanoid is covered in a layer of soft, lightly colored fur and has a long, prehensile tail.","Vanaras are intelligent, simian humanoids who live in deep forests and jungles. They are both agile and clever, but saddled with boundless curiosity and a love of pranks that, while normally harmless, hinder ingratiations with those they encounter. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite its fur, a vanara can grow lengthy hair on its head just like a human, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter than a typical human. Males weigh from 150 to 200 pounds at most, with females weighing slightly less. Vanaras live for 60 to 75 years. Vanaras live in large, tree-top villages connected by rope-bridges and ladders. Homes are carved out of trees but usually left open to the elements except for woven leaf canopies and overhangs. Vanara villages are typically led by the community's religious leader-usually a cleric, oracle, or monk. VANARA CHARACTERS Vanaras are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All vanaras have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Vanaras are agile and insightful, but are also rather mischievous. Climb Speed: Vanaras have a climb speed of 20 feet. Low-Light Vision: Vanaras can see twice as far as a human in conditions of dim light. Nimble: Vanaras have a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks. Prehensile Tail: See above. Languages: A vanara begins play speaking both Common and Vanaran. Vanaras with high Int scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, and Sylvan.",200
Vanth,7,outsider,any,"This looming black skeleton wraps itself in the wings of a giant black raven, and a vulturelike mask of polished ceramic gazes balefully from where its skull should be. Without a gesture, a wickedly curved scythe appears in its elongated fingers.","Stern, silent, and cloaked in ragged wings, unsettling images of vanths haunt mortal depictions of death. Known as reapers, angels of death, or amzranei in some texts, members of this class of psychopomps serve as guardians of the Boneyard and watchers along the routes of the dead. They provide security atop Pharasma's Spire and along the rivers of Souls, protecting the departed from those who see mortal souls as currency or delectable morsels. They also serve as death's foot soldiers against whatever would disrupt the natural cycle of mortality, be it a plague of undeath or a good-aligned temple that dispenses resurrections too freely. In times of great suffering and loss, Pharasma relies on the steely resolve and tireless nature of vanths to harvest the tormented souls of the dead before their agony transforms every battleground or plague quarter into a pit of undeath. Vanths appear as black skeletons with crowlike wings and masks resembling the heads of vultures, crows, and other carrion birds-creatures that clear the mortal planes of corpses. Occasionally they cover themselves in ceremonial brass armor and tabards in funerary shades. Like all psychopomps, a vanth wears a funerary mask crafted from ceramic or polished stone in place of a face. Thanks to their slumped posture, vanths can look most adult humanoids in the eye, despite standing 8 feet tall when erect. They weigh approximately 400 pounds. Ecology Few understand the origins of vanths. While most psychopomps graduate over the span of unfathomable ages from mortal souls and lesser psychopomps, vanths seem altogether distant and alien. Some stories claim they have always guarded the Spire, even before Pharasma came and crafted new servants in their image. Others whisper that all the vanths that ever were or will be ascended from the souls of a distant world of death-worshiping soldiers who spent every moment in life preparing themselves for the end and delighted in their planet's final demise. Habitat & Society With an infinite flux of souls through the Bonelands, there's an equally infinite number of these spirits who attempt to flee, rage against their assigned fate, or merely lash out in madness, only to be laid low by the tattered wings and flashing scythes of vanths. Pharasma's reapers serve as fearsome guardians of the dead and death's assets-sacred coves, forgotten cemeteries, and untended mausoleums. Being inherently disturbing to the mortal psyche, vanths are rarely called on directly by churches in need of aid. Among the planes, most outsiders look upon vanths with scorn. They embody an unf linching dedication to duty, without interest in the strict letter of law or what is right, nor great amount of self-determination. They do because they must, working out of a personal and obsessive sense of duty, not because they're ordered to do so. Their stalwart adherence to their cosmic role makes them far too lawful for chaotic outsiders to appreciate, while their cantankerous methods make lawful outsiders balk. Most insultingly, the suspicious reapers eye and all who enter the Boneyard as potential threats. They follow visiting demons and angels alike, looming from the courts' gothic eves and parapets, casting silent aspersions on even the best-behaved travelers. Unlike most psychopomps, vanths show few mortal proclivities. They rarely speak, even to one another; when they do, their hollow voices carry farther than expected or is socially appropriate. They communicate among one another with slow, deliberate gestures plain enough for most creatures to understand-a strange blend of elaborate human gestures and birdlike head bobs. Most show no interests beyond their immortal role. Even basic emotional reactions seem beyond vanths; they rarely display emotions of their own, and righteous anger or talk of love elicits little more than a confused cock of the head. A vanth's scythe is a proud badge of its station, featuring otherwise unknown symbols that mirror the ancient writing found on mof the Boneyard's forgotten tombs. Their scythes ref lect their role as harvesters of souls in times of great death, but more practically, they inf lict bitter wounds and can sever the silver threads of unwanted astral visitors. Unsurprisingly, vanths loathe astradaemons and descend on the great predators in large numbers. Thanks to the daemons' plane-shifting abilities, these melees occasionally spill over into other planes, dragging countless outsiders into chaotic three- or four-way battles.",3200
Vapor Dire Rat,1,magical beast,any,"This creature looks like a larger, more aggressive version of a normal rat. Its fur is coarse and brown, its eyes green, and its tail is hairless.","Vapor dire rats resemble normal dire rats in all respects. Though more intelligent than dire rats, they seem to possess a lot of the same traits and conduct themselves in much the same way as normal dire rats. They seldom keep compwith their normal counterparts and often times quarrel and fight with dire rats. Vapor dire rats are found just about anywhere save the coldest of climates. Common encounters occur underground or in ruined castles, keeps, temples, and so forth. Regardless of where these creatures construct their nest, a source of waters is always found nearby. Vapor dire rats attack with their bite. A pack uses ambush tactics against potential prey, and when attacking, they often attempt to flank their foe, sending several rats against the creature's flank while the rest hit from the front or sides. Injured vapor dire rats drop back where they can use their fast healing ability  while the holes in their ranks are filled by other vapor dire rats. Vapor dire rats usually assume vapor form and attempt to escape if they lose more than half their numbers. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",400
Vapor Wasp,4,magical beast,temperate forests,This creature looks like a larger version of a normal wasp with a jet black body and reddish eyes.,"Vapor wasps resemble giant wasps in all respects. In some rare species their coloration seems to vary slightly . Vapor wasps construct their nests above ground and most often in forestsed areas. They rarely build their hives in mountains, deserts, or cold climates. A vapor wasp hive is for the most part indistinguishable from an ordinary giant wasp hive. Vapor wasps are not aggressive creatures and generally avoid combat unless threatened or unless the hive is threatened. Creatures wandering within 100 feet of a vapor wasp hive are harassed but almost always left alone. If attacked, or if the hive itself is threatened, the vapor wasps attack relentlessly, using their poisonous sting to fell their opponents. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",1200
Vargouille,2,outsider,any,"This creature is a blackened, bat-winged fiend's head. Tentacles dangle from chin and scalp, and its fanged mouth hangs agape.","A vargouille is larger than a human head, typically between 12 and 20 inches high with a 15- to 35-inch wing span. Vargouilles are not natives of the Material Plane but can often be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay. These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match. Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles take up a common cause and fight as allies, they overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing it to shreds. A vargouille's low power and hideous method of reproduction make for a dangerous combination. Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and as such can be banished with the right magic.",600
Varisian Hagfish,1,animal,temperate waters,"A mouth like a lamprey's gnashes curved teeth at one end of this slimy, eel-like fish.",These cousins to normal hagfish most commonly appear in the Varisian Gulf. They can reach lengths of 4 feet and weigh up to 15 pounds.,400
Vavakia,18,outsider,any,"This reptilian monstrosity is larger than a bull elephant. With the lower body of a spine-backed quadrupedal dinosaur, complete with spiked tail, the demonic creature has the upper body of a muscular humanoid. Its powerful arms wield an immense ranseur while tremendous draconic wings unfurl from its back. The creature's head-part dragon, part saurian, part demon-is a nightmare of horns and fangs and cruel, glowing eyes.","Vavakias are immense demons of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and destructive power, they are most often encountered on the Material Plane not as demons conjured by spellcasters to serve, but as violent invaders come to the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the Material Plane, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange demons are driven to feed on living souls and spread destruction-roles they were built to excel at. A vavakia demon measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its victims, resulting in a horrific transformation into one of the Abyss's most dangerous forms of demonic life. Ecology The first vavakias were created eons ago by Lamashtu, who was unsatisfied with the raw physical might and monstrous shape of mof her earliest demonic minions. In those early days, before she had become a deity, Lamashtu was already quite interested in the method by which the Abyss transformed the souls of sinful mortals into demons. When she learned that this process had first been triggered by the daemons, she was at once intrigued and enraged- intrigued because she knew that anything the Horsemen of the Apocalypse could do, she could do, and enraged at the idea that she owed her very existence to the curiosity of a daemonic lord. Of course, Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly after the daemons first ""taught"" the Abyss how to process sinful souls, but that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by this rage, she waged war against Abaddon for myears and captured two Horsemen of the Apocalypse-predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered one of them, and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating souls and the Abyss before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu's wrath had been spent and all that remained was her own curiosity. Most of Lamashtu's earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous failures, but even in these failures Lamashtu found joy and delight. It wasn't until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then eventually birth the first vavakias that she had her first real success. Lamashtu's early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of Queen of Demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions away from this hideous form of ""art,"" there's no telling what other strange demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true goddess, Lamashtu's interests expand far beyond the ""curiosities"" of the Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane's fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate Lamashtu's feats of creation. In event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success, and are among the Abyss's most dangerous demonic races today. Habitat & Society Although they were originally created to serve as powerful, living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established their own presence on the Abyss as warlords and conquerors. While some pledge their service to powerful demon lords, most vavakias rule small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners infested with swamps, jungles, and other primeval terrains.",153600
Vegepygmy,0.5,plant,underground,"Short, thin, and green, this small humanoid wields a spear. Tendrils of fungus dangle from its arms, midsection, and legs.","Vegepygmys are created by a dangerous fungus known as russet mold- creatures slain by russet mold serve as incubators for the mold's spores, and a day later, the dead body bursts to release 1d6 fully grown vegepygmys. A vegepygmy has no real relation to the body from which it emerges, but the creature may yet retain a strange sort of reverence for its ""birth corpse"" and carry with it a grisly memento from the body, typically a few bones or teeth. Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon. Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speak-they communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds. Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A vegepygmy chieftain is an advanced vegepygmy  that carries an infestation of russet mold spores in its flesh. A vegepygmy chieftain infects creature it hits with its natural weapons with russet mold spores . Russet Mold  This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet areas, and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a vegepygmy lair. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of a patch of russet mold, the fungus releases a cloud of spores in a 5-foot radius burst. Everyone in the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take root in their victims, inf licting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to disease won't protect against russet mold spores, the growth can be halted by remove disease and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores. After 24 hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts from the body of creature slain by russet mold, provided the creature was Small or larger. For each size category larger than Small, the body produces one additional vegepygmy. A patch of russet mold is unharmed by all effects save for acid, alcohol, or remove disease , all of which can kill a single patch of russet mold on contact. Sunlight doesn't kill the mold, but does render it dormant and harmless as long as the sunlight persists.",200

Veiled Master,14,aberration,waters,This monstrosity has a six-eyed face and six long tentacles- four ending in glowing spheres and two in what look like hands.,"The aboleths are among the oldest of Golarion's denizens, creatures that can trace back their presence in the deepest reaches of the world's oceans to times far before humanity came to dwell upon the globe- or before even most deities themselves turned their attentions to this tiny sphere of waters and stone. In those ancient times, elder forces and eldritch entities knew of the world. While they were not gods as are known today, even they were dismissed and ignored by the aboleth race, for the aboleths knew that what the gods could accomplish, so could they, given time. And the aboleths have always had time. During the era of ancient Azlant, when the aboleths manipulated humanity like puppets, some of their kind walked among their pets in disguise, veiling themselves with magic to appear as humanoids. These were the veiled masters, and if one were to make the foolish attempt at imposing human constructions on this alien race, the veiled masters would be considered the nobility among aboleth-kind. In truth, while the aboleths do treat the veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are not regarded as the rulers of the race- even stranger and more dangerous entities rule over the veiled masters in the deepest trenches below the sea. Aboleths are without a doubt skilled at domination and illusion, but the veiled masters are the true experts of the arcane. It is they who engineered the deceptions and manipulations of ancient Azlant's culture. Their hidden gifts and subtle coaxings did much to encourage humanity's first rise to glory in that age, and mof Azlant's nations had veiled masters walking among them, whispering into their leaders' ears. The people knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very long. The veiled masters handled such suspicions by doing violence to the bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. It was the veiled masters who first learned of Azlant's growing hubris-of their beliefs that they were greater than their patrons. At first, their punishments were minor, yet to the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, these acts only strengthened humanity's resolve. In the end, Earthfall was the answer, and as Azlant sank below the waves, the veiled masters retreated to the depths as well, content for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never be forgotten. Today, the veiled masters live on. They walk among the humanoid races again, watching and waiting. The time to teach a new lesson draws ever closer.",38400
Velvet Ant Swarm,3,vermin,warm forests or plains,"A moving carpet of big, red ants with black heads sweeps towards you.","Velvet ants are not really ants at all but a form of wasp. The females are wingless while the males have wings. Velvet ants have a bright red abdomen and thorax and a black head and black legs. Its thorax and abdomen are covered with short, coarse, red hairs. Typical adults reach a length of 1 inch. Velvet ants feed on the nectar of flowers, though on some occasions, the adults have been known to feed on other wasps and bees, particularly bumblebees or honey bees. Other such insects are generally left alone. Velvet ants typically make their lair in bee hives or nests they have taken over. Generally an assault is short and quick, with the velvet ants swarming the bees and quickly gaining the upper hand, slaying all bees in a single nest. Slain bees are kept as food for the velvet ant larvae. Velvet ants are generally inoffensive. Most encounters are with a swarm moving from one location to another, and most attacks happen when a careless individual wanders into the swarm. Male velvet ants are completely harmless. Females compose swarm encountered and they attack with a painful sting. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",800

Its face remains perpetually covered by a dark veil, and a trio of long, forked tongues periodically emerges from its rounded mouth and tastes the air around its thin lips.","The venedaemon personifies death by magic, and so possesses an inborn talent for all manner of sorcery. As hungry for souls as other member of its daemonic brethren, the venedaemon thirsts equally for intangible wealth through the acquisition of knowledge, so that it can best utilize the arcane magic lurking within its blood. In particular, venedaemons yearn for the secrets and magical lore held within the bindings of wizards' tomes, knowing that these arcane formulae are the key to unlocking their mysterious powers. In the process of acquiring such tomes of knowledge, venedaemons invariably come across other forms of information- whether it be info regarding a rival daemon's weaknesses, lore that hints at a wealth of unclaimed souls hidden in one of Abaddon's vast caverns, or a rumor of some hidden and terrible source of daemonic power-that they can make use of in trading with other daemons. These rumors and smatterings of advice can be sold to other daemons for captured souls, and the trade often goes both ways, as venedaemons are also inclined to trade their hard-earned soul gems for tomes of magic other fiends may have chanced upon. In addition to its myriad magical abilities as a daemon, a venedaemon casts spells like a sorcerer with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice. A venedaemon can gain additional levels as a sorcerer in order to bolster its arcane powers, in which case it gains a bloodline  as well as a sorcerer's other class features and special abilities. Venedaemons are gaunt, and despite standing close to 7 feet tall, they rarely weigh more than 150 pounds. Ecology Like all mundane daemons, venedaemons most often form from the hunted, specifically from those evil souls who died as a result of the abuse of magic-whether by their own greedy hands, at the whim of powerful rivals, through the inadvisable pursuit of knowledge too terrible for them to safely handle, or by other spellcasters who slew them for their crimes. While these hunted were often spellcasters themselves, some venedaemons develop from nonmagical souls that were simply casualties to arcane violence. These individuals are often so tainted with the magical disturbances that killed them that they nonetheless develop arcane powers in an ironic twist of daemonic evolution. Other times still, venedaemons formulate from much odder means. Occasionally, mortal wizards seek to control the awe-inspiring forces of Abaddon and its daemons by using cacodaemon as familiars. The cacodaemon, for its part, is usually willing to serve a mortal master for a time in this regard, though it usually has ulterior motives for its servitude. When a cacodaemon familiar's master dies, the daemon is often prompt in devouring the mage's soul and turning the soul into a soul gem. Instead of the soul gem returning to Abaddon and being consumed by a more powerful daemon, sometimes the deceased mage's power triggers a reaction within the cacodaemon, fusing with it and transforming the familiar over several weeks or months into a new creature, typically a venedaemon with no memories of its mortal or previous daemonic existence. Far from being a hazard, this possibility of transformation is in fact one of the primary reasons why cacodaemons are sometimes eager to serve as familiars, as it represents one of the only ways for a cacodaemon to advance its station. Habitat & Society Most venedaemons are relatively weak compared to the towering daemonic brethren that inhabit Abaddon, and knowing this, they often work together as best they can, collaborating in groups with other venedaemons, or in conjunction with other fiends willing to accept their services. Hurled into Abaddon with an innate talent for magic but only scraps of its mortal knowledge remaining, the average venedaemon ultimately flocks to the service of a more powerful daemon willing to act as a patron that lets the venedaemon pursue its studies. In such arrangements, the venedaemon slowly gains power and inf luence within the confines of its daemonic partnership, which often consists of itself, its daemonic master, and mother daemons acting as a team built on the shared goal of total mortal annihilation. This daemonic horde traverses planes searching for opportunities to create mass destruction, the master simply using the venedaemon for its magical qualities to slaughter mortal souls. As the venedaemon gleans what it can from the charred remains of dead mortal spellcasters' volumes of scribbled formulae, it gradually strengthens its unspeakable powers, and in time, the tables are turned, and when the venedaemon slays its patron, it gains dominion over dark magic as well as its brethren. Those venedaemons who do not wish to submit to the will of a more powerful daemon in order to pursue knowledge often simply prefer to be left alone to their research, experimenting on mortals with their dark arts and occasionally selling their findings to other daemons for souls and magical artifacts. Venedaemons find themselves aligned with the lesser fiends of Abaddon, particularly the equally lowly ceustodaemons, whose deathly association with the energies and particularly subservient standing among daemons makes the two obvious allies. Cacodaemons also make for suitable alliances, as a venedaemon may help guide its smaller brethren to capture the soul of an opposing spellcaster, allowing the cacodaemon to mature with the soul and in time develop into a fellow venedaemon. Within the realm of Abaddon, venedaemons gravitate toward the rivers Styx for its mysterious, memory-wiping properties, for mvenedaemons themselves find a peculiar yearning for their memories, if only to regain even more of the power they once possessed, somewhere in the dark recesses of their mind.",1600

Vepar,21,outsider,any,This creature appears as a giant-sized merman with coppery-brown skin and silver scales. Its long black hair is braided and it carries a menacing-looking trident.,"Vepar is an Abyssal duke in the service of Dagon, Prince of the Sea. He leads 29 battalions of shrroths in service to his master. He is a brooding particularly mortals . His loyalty to Dagon is questionable at best, for behind the scenes, Vepar is quietly amassing an army of demons to one day lead against his current lord. But for now, he waits and serves. Vepar's citadel, Leviathan's Reach, is built into an underwaters mountains range that sits several miles below the surface of his watersy Abyssal home. The citadel is guarded by scores of waters demons, fiendish merfolk, and fiendish tritons, as well as several hundred sahuagin led by a fiendish sahuagin 15th-level sorcerer named Anaunon. Most visitors  avoid this place. Vepar resembles a 12-foot tall merman. His upper torso is copperybrown while his lower torso and fins are silver and scaled. Vepar's hair is long and black, and he usually wears it tied back or braided. His eyes, usually blue in color, burn with a silvery fire when he is angered or excited. Under his hair, two small copper horns can be seen just above his eyes. Vepar's hands end in wicked claws with silvery nails. Vepar relies on his trident, spell-like abilities, and ability to deal ability damage when combating foes. Before entering combat, he often raises a storm  to herald his coming, though he is just as likely to attack from ambush or surprise as he is to ""announce"" his arrival. He enters combat with unholy aura active and follows it closely with ice storm. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",409600
Verdurous Ooze,6,ooze,temperate forests or plains,"A pool of greenish muck, blossoming with weird vegetable-like growths and sap-seeping boils, twitches into unnatural motion as a pseudopod springs outward, dragging the entire grotesque mass forward with an ameboid life.","Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again. Ecology Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds, mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3 years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural gases from the land. As mas 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months. Habitat & Society Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and junglesenvironments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass, flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze. Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed. Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes' relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close. Greater Verdurous Ooze Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.",2400
Vermlek,3,outsider,any,"A corpulent man reels on his feet as if drunk, but a closer inspection reveals the horrific truth-he's not so much reeling as he is seething from within, as if his internal organs were coiling and writhing like a knot of greased snakes. Suddenly, with a hideous retching and tearing sound, the man's face blooms out like a rotten flower and a pallid, five-jawed worm extrudes itself from the ragged hole in the neck where, only a moment before, a head sat.","The hideous vermlek demon is one of the lower-ranking members of the demon race, barely above the dretch in power but remarkably more ambitious and intelligent than its pudgy lesser kin. They wriggle and crawl in nauseating numbers in mAbyssal battlefields or graveyards, impatiently awaiting a chance to find a humanoid body to inhabit. Outside of a host body, a vermlek appears like a fatheaded worm with four long tails, each of which ends in a wriggling nest of long filaments. In this form, the vermlek cannot wield weapons, and its bite and spell-like abilities are its only offensive options. A typical vermlek is 7 feet long  and weighs 90 pounds. Ecology Vermleks form from the souls of those who habitually violated the dead in life, such as graverobbers, necromancers, and necrophiles. On the Abyss, the vermleks are countless in number. A single sinful soul can spawn dozens if not hundreds of these demons in much the same way that the body the soul leaves behind spawns maggots. A newly formed vermlek can flop and writhe through the stinking Abyssal necropolises and swamps and boneyards for eons before it finds a body to inhabit, but it's much more common for a vermlek to be ""harvested"" by a more powerful demon for use in a battle. Vermleks harvested in this manner are carried in huge steel cages on the backs of enormous fiendish beasts of burden, such as retrievers, and either sold to powerful Material Plane spellcasters or used in battle against humanoid foes. The classic use for vermleks in such cases is to open the cages containing the worm demons after an initial skirmish or battle so that they can slither out onto the battlefield and claim bodies from the dead, thus recycling the carrion for use in the next battle to come. As vermleks can only inhabit the bodies of humanoids, this tactic isn't as common on the Abyss , but in regions of Golarion where demons hold sway, such as the Worldwound or Tanglebriar, their use can be a particularly demoralizing form of psychological combat. The process by which a vermlek inhabits and controls a dead humanoid is partially biological, partially necromantic. A vermlek's body is boneless and exceptionally elastic-it can wriggle into a body through the mouth, a wound, or other opening in less than a minute, eating the bones and organs within with noisy rapidity. It then settles into the cavity thus created, extending its four tails down into the torso and eventually into the hollowed arms and legs of its host, whereupon the filaments at the tips of these tails weave through nerves and muscle like a puppet's strings. The vermlek can immediately use the body to move about, wield weapons, speak, and otherwise interact with society. The creature can control the coiling and wriggling of its body to keep its host appearing humanoid, but it can do little about the size of its body-humanoids inhabited by a vermlek always look hideously obese. Worse, the host body, which remains dead, rots normally-a vermlek that does not maintain its body's freshness with gentle repose must abandon the rotting flesh 7 days after inhabiting it to seek out a new host. Vermleks know that a keen eye that peers into the mouth of a host can quickly undo their deceptions, and as a result they tend to mutter or mumble when speaking to keep from opening their mouths too wide. Muse veils, helms, or scarves to hide their mouths. When confronted in combat, though, a vermlek in a host body quickly abandons its disguise, extending its hideous worm head out through the host's mouth to give itself a secondary bite attack-doing so ruins the host body for further disguise purposes. Habitat & Society Vermleks can often be found at the sites of vast battlefields on the Abyss where wars with humanoids  have occurred. These sites are particularly common on Kurnugia, where the fiendish gnolls of Lamashtu constantly bicker and war with one another, and on Ishiar, where the fiendish human pirates and scoundrels that dwell upon that oceans's islands wage eternal war. These demons generally spawn in Abyssal realms like Everglut, Uligor, and the Spiral Path, where demon lords associated with the dead or worms rule, and they can be found in great number in those regions' vast graveyards and necropolises. Although they are often used as disposable infantry in mass battles, vermleks themselves have little taste for such activities and, left to their own desires, prefer to live in hiding among humanoids on the Material Plane if they can find their way into that realm. A vermlek fortunate enough to find itself on the Material Plane enjoys disguising itself as a laborer, gravedigger, dungsweeper, or other lowclass role in which it can blend in while still having access to the city's dead. A vermlek's ghoulish and taboo lusts are only magnified by its creation, and on the Material Plane, the arrival of one of these filthy demons in a society almost always presages a sudden upswing in scandalously violent or distasteful crime.",800

Vetala,6,undead,any,"With its bloodless flesh and eyes the color of deepest night, this imperious being obviously no longer numbers among the living.","While most of the Inner Sea's vampires lust for living blood, the mysterious vetalas hunger for a more intangible force: the energy that infuses mortal minds. Referred to as consciousness or psyche by some, the academics of Vudra- from where most vetalas hail-call this fundamental vital force prana. Regardless of their desire's name, vetalas prey upon those who show creative promise, possess potent force of will, or seem destined for greatness, draining the most brilliant sources of mortal light to fuel their own unnatural embers. Their dark mastery of life force allows vetalas to possess corpses or even overwhelm the minds of living creatures. With these stolen masks and the resources of abducted lives, they work their foul wills. Vetalas are said to be the spirits of children ""born evil,"" who never received burial rites upon their deaths. Sometimes one of these evil spirits takes hold of a corpse- not necessarily its own-which becomes its anchor to the mortal world. Such young souls seek out experiences and life energy, becoming as wicked as other vampire as they endlessly indulge their profane, deathless desires. CREATING A VETALA ""Vetala"" is an acquired template that can be added to living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice . Most vetalas were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vetala uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead . Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A vetala gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vetalas use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points . Defensive Abilities: A vetala gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and good, and resistance to fire 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vetala also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vetala is helpless and its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour. Additional damage dealt to the vetala has no effect. Its body might be subjected to method of dismemberment or desecration, but after 1 hour-regardless of the state of its remains-it regains 1 hit point, is no longer helpless, and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Weaknesses: Vetalas cannot tolerate the sound of prayers or religious mantras recited by those truly faithful to a good deity. Any character with a good-aligned deity can force a vetala to recoil by dramatically praying as a standard action. Praying doesn't harm a vetala; it merely keeps the creature at bay. A recoiling vetala must stay at least 5 feet away from a praying character and cannot touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a vetala can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. The prayers of those who worship non-good deities or worship no deity have no effect on a vetala. Reducing a vetala's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it . However, consecrating the vetala's remains and burying the body destroys it forever. A vetala's body is considered consecrated if it is doused with a vial of holy waters and buried, if it is buried in earth affected by the spell consecrate, or if bless, prayer, or a similar divine spell is cast upon it as it is being buried. Digging up a vetala's corpse or profaning the area where it's buried does not restore a buried vetala. Speed: Same as the base creature. A vetala also gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed. Melee: A vetala gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. A vetala's claw attacks do damage as a creature once size category larger . A vetala's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A vetala gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the vetala's Hit Dice + the vetala's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Drain Prana : A vetala can drain the mental vitality of a grappled opponent. If the vetala establishes or maintains a pin, it drains this energy, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Additionally, the victim is affected by the spell modify memory, as if the vetala had spent 5 minutes concentrating. The vetala gains perfect knowledge of memory it chooses to eliminate using this ability. Vetalas often use this ability to prevent victims from remembering they've been attacked. Malevolence : As a full-round action, a vetala can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature's body, as the spell magic jar , except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vetala's possession for 24 hours. If a creature fails its save, its consciousness and control of its body are subsumed as the vetala takes command of its body. The vetala can remain in control for a number of hours equal to its Charisma modifier or until it decides to end the possession. Whenever the possession ends or the host body is killed, the vetala's consciousness instantly returns to its body, regardless of distance, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the vetala's body has been destroyed or moved to another plane, the vetala's consciousness is destroyed when the possession ends. While possessing another creature, the vetala's body is empty and vulnerable, though it is instantly aware if its body is disturbed or takes damage. Paralysis : Any creature struck by a vetala's claws must make a successful Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to this effect. Possess Corpse : As a full-round action, a vetala can possess a Large or smaller corpse just as it can a living body. The vetala's consciousness leaves its body and takes control of the corpse, animating it as either a skeleton or zombie . The vetala can remain in control of a corpse indefinitely, and can communicate through the body, but cannot use of its other special abilities. This ability otherwise functions just as malevolence. Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +2, Cha +6. As an undead creature, a vetala has no Constitution score. Feats: Vetalas gain Alertness, Blind-Fight, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, and Skill Focus  as bonus feats. Skills: Vetalas gain a +8 racial bonus on Disguise, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.",2400

Vilkacis,7,undead,land,"Within a swirling mass of frigid air manifests the form of a bestial specter. Claws the size of daggers lash menacingly before its half-bestial, half-humanoid form, and its narrow eyes glow with a smoldering malevolence.","Beings of pure malevolence and destruction, vilkacis arise from the souls of the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits burning with the need for bloodshed and vengeance. Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal flesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous aff liction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more. Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and claws. Ecology Although a vilkacis exists only in a spectral form, its canopic stone permanently binds the spirit to the Material Plane. So long as the stone exists, the creature remains stuck between life and death, its spirit strangling on its own rage. When a vilkacis seizes possession of a victim, the host takes on an altered appearance ref lective of the beast within its body. The victim undergoes severe physical dysmorphia. Musculature enlarges, posture becomes stooped, and hands curl into gashing claws. The face takes on a bestial appearance. The victim's jaws extend and grow into jagged, wolfish fangs, while the brow thickens and the pupils widen to black pools that radiate a mad, feral stare. In this state, the vilkacis-possessed creature froths with the curse of lycanthropy and can pass the curse on as though it were a werewolf. Although such a possessed creature might pass on the infamous disease, its own transformation typically lasts only a matter of hours. A vilkacis is ever searching for stronger and more vicious hunters to use as tools in slaking its eternal bloodlust; if it finds a particularly promising host, it might visit and possess the favored body again and again for its rampages. Habitat & Society Vilkacis most commonly appear in areas where human settlements border or stand within wildernesses. While they are commonly associated with werewolves, the folklore of mnomadic and nature-worshiping societies contains stories of creatures whose descriptions bear strong resemblance to vilkacis. Most haunt the territories where they were created, staying within range of their canopic stones, and hunting within the lands they prowled in life. However, those with the ability to summon vilkacis usually attempt to direct them toward specific prey. This often proves a dangerous or even fatal proposition, however, and few reports exist of anyone successfully mastering a vilkacis. Creating a Vilkacis While mvilkacis spontaneously arise under the light of the full moon from the remains of the most savage werewolves, some foul spellcasters seek out the corpses of such bestial murderers, attempting to enslave their spirits and harness their capacity for brutality to fulfill the spellcasters' dark whims. To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act. Although mvilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.

Vilstrak,0.5,aberration,underground,"This creature is a bipedal man-sized semi-humanoid seemingly carved of stone. It has an insect-like head, long, large arms, and thick, trunklike legs that end in hoof-like feet.","Vilstraks  dwell underground, away from the surface world. Though they have no allergy or reaction to sunlight, they disdain its existence, preferring the cold, damp blackness of their underground world. A vilstrak's lair is a ""pocket"" formed deep inside the earth. These pockets have no exits or entrances and are only reachable by those who can pass through stone or earth. A typical vilstrak stands six feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Its arms have an extra joint between the elbow and wrist, and its arms end in large, powerful fists of stone. Vilstraks are gray or brown. Vilstraks are peaceful creatures that avoid combat if possible. They do take great joy and pride in robbing those that invade their territory. A favored tactic of the vilstrak is to hide inside the wall of a dungeon corridor and spring out when prey passes nearby.

Violet Fungus,3,plant,underground,This mushroom grows from a bed of tentacular roots. Deep violet tendrils slither out of the dozens of fissures in its pointed cap.,"The violet fungus is one of the most notorious and feared dangers of the world's caves. A traveler can often see signs of the violet fungus in those who dwell or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In these folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where entire furrows of flesh seem scooped away-the marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus. A violet fungus feeds on the rot and decay of organic matter, but unlike most fungi, they are not passive consumers of corruption. A violet fungi's tendrils can strike with unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent venom that causes flesh to rot and decay with nauseating speed. This potent poison, if left untreated, can cause the flesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in no time at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into corruption as well. Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move to attack or to hunt for prey. A violet fungus that has a steady supply of rot to sup upon is generally content to remain in one place. Munderground-dwelling cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly troglodytes and vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet fungi in key junctions and entrances to their caverns as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den in search of food. Some species of shriekers  are relatively similar in appearance to violet fungi, although they lack the tentacular branches. It's not uncommon to find shriekers and violet fungi growing in the same grove-especially in areas where other creatures cultivate the fungi as guardians. A violet fungus is 4 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds. Violet Venom Although a violet fungus's tentacles swiftly grow inert after the mushroom is slain, they can be wielded as Medium-sized whips for 2d6 minutes after being harvested from the creature. These whips inf lict rot on anything they touch-including the wielder of the deadly weapon-and both save DCs to resist and effects are identical to the stats presented above. A DC 25 Craft  check and 250 gp worth of reagents can preserve the venom somewhat, although the procedure dilutes it signif icantly.

Viper Vine,13,plant,temperate or warm forests or swamps,"Large tendrils ending in tiny claws unfurl from the central stalk of this plant, which rises like a serpent ready to strike.","A voracious, flesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous bloom arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. While stories speaking of the plant's ability to lure prey into its clutches by virtue of its swaying motion persist, this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud. Since viper vines gain nourishment through the consumption of creatures rather than through moisture and soil, they have developed rudimentary locomotion and are able to drag themselves along the ground with their tentacle-like root system. They even possess a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing them to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous looking. The area around the hunting grounds of these predators is often strewn with the remains of victims, and it is not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, illfated adventurers, and even giants in their immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind by the plant's victims.",25600

Vishkanya,0.5,humanoid,any,This lithe woman wears loose-fitting robes and wields a cruel-looking blade. Her eyes are pure white orbs.,"Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya's flesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A vishkanya's tongue is forked like a serpent's tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils. Although legends abound that the merest touch from a vishkanya can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A vishkanya's skin is no more poisonous than that of human, but it is true that their blood, spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the vishkanya's poison. A vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds. VISHKANYA CHARACTERS Vishkanyas are defined by their class levels- they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Vishkanyas have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Vishkanyas are graceful and elegant, but often irrational. Low-Light Vision: Vishkanyas can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Keen Senses: Vishkanyas receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Limber: Vishkanyas gain a +2 racial bonus on Escape Artist and Stealth checks. Poison Resistance: A vishkanya has a racial bonus on saves against poison equal to its Hit Dice. Poison Use: See above. Toxic: See above. Weapon Familiarity: Vishkanyas are always prof icient with blowguns, kukri, and shuriken. Languages: Vishkanyas begin play speaking Common and Vishkanya.

Vodyanoi,5,monstrous humanoid,rivers or marshes,"This humanoid salamander carries a gnarled staff in one hand. Tendrils drape its chin, resembling the beard of an eccentric hermit.","Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years. Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards- another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger-a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary , gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.",1600
Void Yai,20,outsider,cold or temperate mountains,"This towering, three-eyed horned giant carries himself with the self-assurance of an undefeated champion of countless wars.","The concept of the void is a difficult one for mindividuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of ""void"" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race. Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds. Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes. VOIDLORDS Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling category of unique void yai. But to even use the term ""middling"" in this context is something of a folly, for these unique void yai, known collectively as the voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures to walk the Material Plane. While void yai typically content themselves with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a greater mission-to control entire worlds and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible. Martial Arts: A voidlord of martial arts always attacks with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk with the flurry of blows ability for the purposes of determining its damage and number of attacks per round with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following spell-like abilities three times per day: forceful hand, grasping hand, and greater shout. Swordplay: A voidlord of sword fighting always carries a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities three times per day: blade barrier, keen edge, and mage's sword. They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and sword they wield is treated as a +5 weapon, in addition to other magical qualities the weapon might have. A voidlord of swordplay can also permanently transform magic weapon  into a sword of size or type by touch.",307200
Voidstick Zombie,12,undead,any,"This shambling humanoid's taut gray skin shows signs of arcane symbols now faded with age and decay. Long, darkwood spikes riddle its body; every inch of flesh is staked and violated. A palpable aura of entropy and despair hangs over the sorry, perforated creature.","The voidstick zombie is the hateful creation of wicked shamans and necromancers, who use voidsticks to animate the dead. One voidstick is required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature. These vile devices, each of which is 6 to 10 inches in length, are pierced through the living or dead body of a creature, pumping the dark energy of the void into its form. Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother source of positive energy. Multiple voidsticks in a creature's form feed one another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures' abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance and inf luence other creatures that depend on negative energy. These sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long before its current inhabitants made their home there. As the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the voidsticks, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile voidsticks in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of becoming a ritual meal for their tribes. Since the rediscovery of voidsticks, those interested in necromancy and the creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous intent. Voidsticks In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the faithful to visit holy places with regularity. In particular, the weak, the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk dangerous waters crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to this, the godstick was born-a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine, carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus devotion at location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign, however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the voidsticks and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry abominations. Voidstick Aura faint necromancy [evil]; CL 5 Slot special; Price 2,500 gp, Weighs 1 lb. DESCRIPTION Each voidstick is 6 t0 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge  check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.

Voidworm,2,outsider,any,"This tiny, iridescent serpent slithers through empty space, the air around it distorting as if from heat.","Debate rages as to whether or not the strange and capricious creatures called voidworms are actually proteans at all. To the wizards and sorcerers who summon them as familiars, the answer seems obvious- these tiny dwellers of Limbo have all the requisite racial traits of proteans, down to their serpentine shapes. Yet the established protean castes find such claims outright insulting, claiming instead that it is such acts of conjuration that call voidworms forth from the raw stuff of Limbo, giving them shape and life according to the spellcasters' expectations, and that these lesser beings are but pale ref lections of their formidable kin. Voidworms themselves have little to say on the matter- creatures of the moment, and sparing little thought for the constantly mutable concept of ""reality,"" voidworms only barely grasp cause and effect, and the past has no more substance or signif icance for them than a dream. In order to gain a voidworm as a familiar, a spellcaster must be chaotic neutral, be caster level 7th, and have the Improved Familiar feat. Regardless of their actual origins, voidworms maintain a thriving ecology in the chaos of Limbo, forming together into darting, flashing schools that are often hunted for sport by naunets and other predators of chaos. Mortal wizards, however, most commonly encounter voidworms as summoned familiars. These tiny, serpentine creatures are particularly valued by illusionists, evokers, and other magical practitioners who deal with distorting or molding reality, though the familiars' bizarre logic and miniscule attention spans sometimes make them more trouble than they're worth. Still, their confusing attack and remarkable hardiness have saved more than one wizard on the battlef ield, and their strange thought processes can sometimes offer unique insights in the laboratory. When traveling in more mundane lands, wizards often order voidworm familiars to use their change shape ability to disguise themselves as ordinary pets or animal familiars, though these disguises tend to slip when the voidworm grows curious or playful. A voidworm is only 2 feet long and weighs a mere 2 pounds. No two voidworms are exactly alike in their coloration or markings. Their two feathery wings generally take on brighter colors than the rest of their bodies, and in the case of voidworms conjured as familiars, these ""wings"" are the same color as their masters' eyes.",600

Voonith,4,magical beast,rivers or marshes,"This brightly colored, long-necked amphibian has six legs, a fanged snout, and numerous finlets running down its spine.","Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious nocturnal predators with voracious appetites and mild intelligence. A voonith's howl is said to freeze the blood and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too far away from the waters's edge to ambush. While the vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream, mhave found their way out of that realm and into the waking world to take up lairs in the swampsy fens and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition between worlds is unclear. Although they look like little more than wild beasts, vooniths are actually rather intelligent. While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they're little more than dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampsy regions tell tales of overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear is not always for the best. While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith creatures-particularly humans, cats, and gnomes- meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conf lict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamps, a friendly voonith will provide what aid it can.

The front of the beast has a long trunk similar to that of an elephant. Its skin glistens as if coated with a sheen of oil.,"Vorins live in dismal swamps and bogs, lurking down in the murk and the mire.

The draconic half of one of these strange monsters always possesses greenhued scales, gradually shifting from dull olive to radiant emerald shades as the creature ages. A typical vouivre is over 12 feet long from head to head, and weighs about 500 pounds. Ecology Vouivres make their homes in small caves near slowmoving rivers, placid lakes, and gurgling streams. There they keep their treasured items and frequently bathe in the soothing waters, preying on anyone who strays too close to the waters's edge. Vouivres prefer to capture and eat humanoid males, but will feed on available warmblooded prey when hungry. Rarely, a vouivre selects humanoid females as its primary prey, usually frequent bathers or washerwomen visiting a nearby brook. After devouring a humanoid, a vouivre can forgo a meal for 2 months before needing to feed again. Vouivres breed in a unique manner. Living as celibates, these creatures reproduce asexually, only producing a new specimen after death. This bizarre process is more akin to a form of cloning than actual reproduction, leading some scholars to conjecture that only a fixed number of these creatures exist in the world simultaneously. After a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a glassy, rubytinted sphere that serves as an egg of sorts. Beginning 1 week after death, this egg begins growing, eventually reaching a diameter of 2 feet, while its gleaming luster dims to a clouded, dull red. After 6 weeks, the gem splits, giving birth to a vouivre hatchling that must find a suitable secluded sanctuary and begin feeding itself from nearby resources. This immature form remains hidden for years, slithering through obscuring muck and feeding on watersfowl and swimming rodents, until it reaches adult size, fully grown and ready to hunt its favorite prey. While not a complete replica of its mother, a vouivre inherits traits and characteristics of its parent's meals throughout its lifetime. A vouivre understands this and thus seeks out handsome and formidable targets for its meals, hoping to pass down the best possible traits to its eventual offspring. A vouivre lives for roughly 200 years, barring violent end, and matures from hatchling to adult in 7 years. All vouivres have a singular relationship with sound. As it desires, and especially when slithering seductively toward a victim, a vouivre can vibrate its scales, producing a haunting hum that excites the waters around it in a strange, rippling harmony. A vouivre uses this sound as the basis for mof its spell-like abilities, accompanying the effects with song and seductive oratory. When a vouivre grows agitated, this low drone can reach a crescendo of ear-shattering noise, or become an insinuating resonance that turns trusted companions against each other. Habitat and Society Solitary almost to the point of xenophobia, vouivres rarely meet. These creatures make their lairs far away from one another, and considering their unique style of reproduction, a single lineage can prey upon a particular region for centuries. Although vouivres live in isolation from other intelligent creatures, they possess an afinity for serpents. Snakes of all kinds find themselves drawn to vouivres, with vipers and constrictors frequently found slithering among the scattered treasure in a vouivre's lair. Those fortunate few who have survived an encounter with a vouivre often report snakes assisting in the attack. Sages speculate that the delicate vibrations produced by a vouivre's scales enchant the serpents into this service. Vouivres get along well with evil fey living near their lairs and sometimes even go so far as to share trinkets and gems from their hoards in return for mutual protection and companionship. Nefarious nixies, sinister selkies, and other watersborne fey particularly find places within a powerful vouivre's entourage. While they all have their own diverse hunting grounds, these companions meet regularly to share stories and even meals. Though savage and bestial, vouivres have a love for material items. Gold jewelry, loose coins, finely cut gems, lavish decorations, and fine silks lie about their lairs. Vouivres covet this treasure and arrange the glittering goods in pleasing configurations, whimsically shifting the items around and redecorating as they please. These creatures constantly barter and trade, and demand payment from victims who beg for their lives. Frequently, vouivres use their treasure as a way to lure unsuspecting travelers close, placing the bait among the reeds near the waters's edge to catch the glint of the sun. As victims come to claim their found prize, the vouivre reveals its humanoid half while its dragon head lies unseen in the waters below. Vouivres prefer intelligent humanoids as prey, to hunt, toy with, and eventually eat. Adept at charm, deception, and trickery, vouivres rarely attack their prey directly, instead preferring to engage their victims in conversation before attacking unexpectedly. In combat, a vouivre's dragon head begins by roaring forth with a gout of flame before biting foes. With prey in its mouth, the dragon head can lock its jaws in place, holding a creature fast in its backward-curving teeth as the vouivre swims to deeper waters to drown its victim before bringing it back to its treasure-strewn cave for a satisfying meal.",19200
Vrock,9,outsider,any,A cloud of spores and a trail of feathers surrounds this twisted cross between a man and a gigantic vulture.,"Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and violence of that despicable realm. As ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic as the scavengers they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing the sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing entrails from a living husk. A typical vrock stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Vrocks generally form from the evil souls of hateful and wrathful mortals, particularly those who were career criminals, mercenaries, or assassins.",4800

Unlike other demons, it does not form from a sinful soul-it instead manifests from a nabasu demon that returns to the Abyss after growing to maturity on the Material Plane.

Vrykolakas,10,undead,any,"Slinking forth on bent limbs and gnarled claws, this twisted abomination bears a resemblance to a starved, plague-ridden ape, its form bestial and bent, with pallid skin stretched unnaturally over knotted bone. Yet its visage holds a greater terror, for amid fangs and milky eyes linger the withered features of a living corpse.","A restless and savage form of undead, the vrykolakas knows only rage and relishes the suffering of those who failed it in life. Reanimated corpses of wicked and vengeful souls denied even the basic burial rites, these unreasoning vampire-kin unleash their wrath against the living, indiscriminately spreading disease and death among all in their paths. Their bitterness at their own disgraced ends drives them to a loathing of all life and a jealous desire to see all other living creatures fall to their same level of profanity and debasement. Such hardly proves a conscious plot, though, but rather a fundamental instinct. Thus, a single vrykolakas can devastate an entire village, potentially spawning a host of new vrykolakas from their victims. A vrykolakas  appears as a terrible, bestial corruption of the being it was in life. Twisted by rage and undeath into an animalistic shape, these undead bear the taint of death, their bodies lean to the appearance of starvation and pocked with evidence of rot and disease. Hunched and twisted, a vrykolakas's bent spine is the same length it was in life if straightened, but the feral posture of most cause them to slump to a mere 4-1/2 to 5 feet tall. The wasting of death also greatly decreases the corpse's weight, reducing even hearty men to at least 20 or 30 pounds less than they weighed in life. Ecology Despite its savage and decayed appearance, a vrykolakas often passes through towns and villages undeterred, due to its supernatural ability to disguise itself. With the ability to cloak its terrible shape, a vrykolakas typically appears little different than it did in life. Death removes much of the living corpse's sense of who it was, though, so vrykolakas rarely reconstruct their original appearances with complete accuracy. Thus, family and acquaintances often notice the resemblance, but do not readily identify a vrykolakas as the resurrected individual. A vrykolakas thrives upon disease and death, drawing its vigor from those humanoids it passes near. It walks among the living merely to infect them with its grave taint, passing on the subtle corruption of death. Its mere touch drains the life from a victim as well, stealing from its very essence. A vrykolakas's favored victims typically come from among its former family members and friends, which it pursues with only half a memory of previous connection, yet a lingering malice, as such former companions failed to prevent its accursed fate. A vrykolakas is uniquely bound to the place where it died or its body was originally interred. It must return to this site every Starday and bury itself amid the earth or stones to rest for 24 hours. A vrykolakas is entirely helpless during this period and can be easily destroyed if it can be located. The vampire-kin understand this weakness, though, and go to great lengths to avoid being followed to their resting places. Habitat & Society Vrykolakas typically appear near or in rural areas close to their graves. They walk the open streets of villages and hamlets during daylight hours, avoiding direct interaction and attention, all the while infecting those nearby and robbing them of their vitality. By night they seek to take their revenge more overtly, wreaking havoc upon the community, destroying food and property, attacking and smothering people in their beds, stealing valuables, and generally terrorizing people. Mrural superstitions and prejudices against strangers stem from tales of vrykolakas, slipping quietly into town or lurking at the edges of a community, spreading death and despair among the innocent. The Greek Vampire The vrykolakas  is an undead creature from Greek folklore. Synonymous with revenants, these terrors manifest as humans that have returned from the grave to perform some act before they can peacefully rest. Mstories of the vrykolakas are not of horrid, evil undead, but of deceased persons attempting to return to their former lives, such as the shoemaker who returned from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry waters, and chop firewood. The more vengeful type of vrykolakas gained stronger belief in Greece after the arrival of Slavic immigrants, who brought with them tales of blood-drinking vampires and werewolves. The word vrykolakas itself borrows from Slavic, derived from the Bulgarian word vukodlak, vuk meaning ""wolf "" and dlaka meaning ""fur."" This suggests that vrykolakas were somehow associated with werewolves, most likely due to the Slavic belief that werewolves became vampires after they died. A person could become a vrykolakas in a variety of ways. The most common involve a person being evil and immoral, an excommunication from the church, or improper burial rites. Some thought that eating the meat of a sheep that had been killed or wounded by a wolf or a werewolf would turn a person into a vrykolakas. A cat or other animal jumping over a dead body could also result in its evil return. Curses, such as ""may the ground not receive thee,"" would also condemn the recipient to undeath as a vrykolakas. Malso believed that a vrykolakas would knock at your door and call your name, but could only do so once. If one answered the door, he would die shortly thereafter, and become a vrykolakas. For this reason, the superstition that one should not answer the door until the second knock still exists in some Greek villages.",9600

Vulchlings can occasionally be found in the compof harpies or vrocks, but most of their time is spent in their lairs-usually large nests found deep within the earth. Vulchlings prefer to attack from secret or ambush by lying in wait for their prey and then swooping in to attack with their razor-sharp talons and beak.

Vulnudaemon,4,outsider,any,"A bloody, tooth-filled mouth that looks almost like a horrific gash gasps in the neck of this pale, childlike horror.","These deceptive daemons personify death resulting from murder accented with betrayal. Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet. Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the protection of invisibility in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until their opponents bleed out. Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course, another matter. Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.",1200
Vulpinal,6,outsider,land,"This bright-eyed, anthropomorphic fox is dressed in simple traveling clothes and carries a musical instrument in one hand.","Among the smallest of the agathions, vulpinals tend to be the most outspoken and friendly of their kind, and also the most far-ranging across the planes. A vulpinal looks like a humanoid fox, often with brilliantly colored fur  and a tail as long as its height. As the bards and sages of the agathions, they dress in functional clothing, typically embellishing a single article to show their creativity and personality. Most appear to be adults, though others look more like fox kits  while some look much older . Their hands are humanoid in shape, with tiny clawed fingers. A typical vulpinal prefers a life of solitary travel, though they have been known to pair up or travel in groups if they find like-minded individuals who have much to teach and share. They are particularly fond of lillends, and these winged azatas can easily carry the child-sized vulpinals, giving vulpinals mopportunities to share stories. Indeed, for a vulpinal, there are few greater pleasures than sharing their knowledge-acting as sages of the planes, teaching songs and dances from exotic places, and composing poems about beautiful places in the natural world. Though they are gentle by nature, they fight to defend beauty, especially if their magic can bolster the more martial celestial races.

Vydrarchs live solely for the thrill of destruction and chaos, but what elder force could have created such a monster is unknown.

Wang Liang,3,outsider,lawful evil-aligned plane,This feral humanoid creature is completely hairless with gray skin. Its eyes are pools of midnight with glittering red ruby dots that serve as pupils and shine with a hellish glow. Its hands end in razor-sharpened talons that have the appearance and color of iron. Its mouth is lined with rows of shark-like teeth and its ears are pointed.,"The wang liang are an infernal race of humanoid beings bred for power and cruelty by the authority of Lucifer himself. It is said that the blood of Lucifer himself and that of his most trusted advisors was mixed with that of mortal races to spawn this horrid hybrid. Before his fall, the wang liang were the former ruler of Hell's most devout worshippers. The wang liang organized themselves into monk-like sects and frequently acted as spies and enforcers in Hell and as emissaries and advisors to mortal rulers across the material planes. A typical wang liang stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. It speaks Infernal and Common. At will the wang liang may cause their iron clawed fingertips and razor sharp fangs to drip with an infernal venom. Wang liang prefer to use misdirection and intimidation to alter the outcome of fights and bide their time if possible to assault foes when they are at their most vulnerable. It is not uncommon for a wang liang to use allies to their advantage. When pressed into actual combat they use full attacks in an attempt to infuse their opponent with as much venom as possible. Wang liang masters are often found leading monasteries of wang liang monks dedicated to Lucifer. Such monasteries dedicated to the Dark One are located in remote, out of the way places or cleverly disguised as another business or monastery if found within a populated area. Wang liang were once greater than they currently are, having suffered great losses and in mcases a thinning of their infernal bloodline in the course of their masters defeat. Spiteful over their diminished authority, they now pursue strength through exercise of their old monastic ways and practice of martial arts or pursuit of sorcerous knowledge. The wang liang still organize themselves into regimented monastic orders, sending their most gifted champions out on missions to spread the words of Lucifer. Wang Liang Characters Wang liang leaders are usually monks or monk/sorcerers. Having been bred in the lusts of Lucifer and with the industry of the coal chambers of hell the wang liang player characters are often raised within the monasteries of lawful evil sects of monks upon the material planes. Due to their natural attacks and nerve numbing venom they quickly rise in the ranks of such sanctuaries of hellish intent, often serving as grand champions and grand masters.

Warden Jack Swarm,4,construct,any,A carpet of tiny steel spheres rolls towards you.,"Warden jacks are miniscule metal objects in the shape of a ball covered in sharp spikes. These things are able to move on their own by retracting their spikes, and rolling along the ground. They are commonly used as guardians by wizards and nobles who fear the intrusion of thieves. Warden jacks never attack their creator and can be programmed to avoid specific individuals or types of individuals, or to attack only specific types of individuals, or attack only under specific conditions as specified by the creator. These constructs are capable of guarding an entire floor or area, but are unable to climb up stairs and are stopped by closed doors or other impassable objects that they cannot fit through. They can, however, fall down stairs or navigate even the steepest of slopes. Warden jacks resemble caltrops somewhat, and typically range from 1-3 inches in diameter. Warden jack swarms have two modes of attack: as moving caltrops, or as rolling marbles. They set themselves up for combat by rolling into the path of their opponents and extending their spikes. Once combat begins, most of them roll around continually, extending their spikes and attempting to wound an opponent. Some remain in spheroid form in order to get under the feet of a foe and bring it to the ground. Extending or retracting spikes is a free action for the warden jack swarm.

Warmonger Devil,7,outsider,Hell,"Armored like an infernal knight upon some monstrous steed, this fiend of iron and nails scuttles upon six heavy, bladed, beetle-like legs. Its body seems to be nothing more than plates upon hulking plates of dark metal, each pierced through with gleaming spikes studded with the gruesome trophies of past massacres. In one clawed gauntlet it grips a long, twisted trident, while in the other it readies a thick net woven with fiendish barbs.","Fearsome giants of steel and blades, levalochs serve within the armies of archdevils and infernal dukes as potent warriors and tenacious hunters, creatures of absolute discipline endlessly obedient to diabolical tyrants. Renowned for their skill on Hell's battlefields, these fearsome soldiers excel in moving swiftly over the broken landscapes that typify the nine layers of the Pit, hunting down intruders and seeking out errant souls wherever they might flee. En masse, the armored clanking of obedient and watchful infantry sound like the workings of great machines as levaloch hosts man Hell's ramparts, from the Iron Fortresses of Avernus to the walls of Ashtart. Levalochs possess consistent forms, each resembling all others of their kind in general shape and size, though each devil's armor proves distinctive. Some claim that the arrangement of a levaloch's spikes, horns, blades, or other iron-shod embellishments might reveal what layer of Hell or infernal noble spawned the devil, though few have the time to ponder such concerns as one of these razor-legged legionaries rages forward. With little variation, levalochs stand just over 10 feet tall and weigh almost exactly 1 ton. Ecology Levalochs blur the line between devil and automaton. While created from the souls of the damned and the profane energies of Hell, these fiends live only to obey their masters and, upon their home plane, seemingly possess little will or ambition beyond such obedience. Requiring no food or rest, a levaloch sentinel might hold its post, completely motionless, for centuries, collecting ages of dust without complaint as it awaits orders that might never come. While intelligent, these devils prove fanatically devoted to the causes of their masters, the archdevils, Asmodeus, and Hell itself, drawing on ingrained wells of discipline and faith to mete out the greater will of their overlords. Levalochs are highly prized throughout the Pit for this discipline, held up as epitomes of diabolical warriors second only to the ferocious cornugons, and pointed to throughout the planes as embodiments of the soldier's ideal. Yet this discipline only persists while levalochs remain under orders from more powerful devils. Left to their own devices, each levaloch fancies itself a tyrant by its own right and relishes the opportunity to promote conf lict and bloodshed through petty mortal angst and grudges. While all devils possess anatomies that perpetually baff le mortal scholars, levalochs prove even more enigmatic, having no internal physiology at all. Being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin and Hell-forged armor, these fiends lack all weaknesses of even infernal flesh and blood, while retaining all of the potent resistances common to their diabolical kin. A levaloch's sentience seems to linger within its armored shell, remaining until that exoskeleton proves too damaged to contain an animating spirit longer. Should a levaloch's armor be destroyed, the plates of metal and carapace fall to pieces and quickly corrode, revealing nothing more than the strong scent of pitch within. Despite their unusual anatomy, levalochs are still thinking, even cunning creatures. The fiendish intelligences housed within these ironclad horrors cause some sages to draw frightening parallels between levalochs and the profane soul-bound armors of the infamous undead graveknights. Habitat & Society Commonly found upon the first and sixth layers of Hell and amid the outlying fortresses of Dis, levalochs muster in the service of the Pit's most martial tyrants. Most know only their orders, following their masters' commands to the letter, disregarding all things that fall outside of their purview-at least until such things threaten their masters' holdings or themselves. Intruders within infernal citadels sometimes find themselves unchallenged as they wander vast halls watched over by whole platoons of posted, idle levalochs, only to be attacked unexpectedly upon encountering those specifically commanded to stand sentry. These fiends hold to their orders not out of dull-wittedness, but out of obsessive obedience to the rule of Hell, as proven by their murderous cunning in battle. On the rare occasions levalochs find themselves left to their own devices, the true intellect of these armored terrors becomes apparent. Capable of shocking changes in personality, a levaloch that might not have spoken a word in its entire existence might prove shrewd and subtle when it finds itself upon the Material Plane, stirring old angers, forging Hellish weaponry, even training mortal warriors in a strategic game of warmongering and open campaigning, all encouraging bloodshed in the name of Hell. They despise the weakness of emotion and the changeability of mortal minds. Thus, they delight in testing themselves against mortal flesh, indulging in massacres and encouraging genocides against such weak, worthless creatures whenever their plots might gain even the slightest benefit from such atrocities. Such pride rarely proves the undoing of levalochs, though, as these armored fiends treat every battle as a chance to hone their impressive skills and give foes-regardless of race-no quarter.",3200
Warsworn,16,undead,any,"An enormous animate mass comprised of dozens of armed and armored corpses undulates forth, like a living siege tower of steel-girded flesh. Where this mangled army of broken blades and rent flesh passes, the ground is torn and soaked in blood.","Warsworns are massive, undead amalgams, their evershifting, chaotic bodies composed of countless deceased soldiers and their armor and weapons. Their shambling, serpentine forms tower over giants, and when warsworns move, the monsters create a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle. The history of warsworns is an odd one; the divinely created monstrosities' origins are as disturbing as their image suggests. Deities occasionally turn their attention to the ruined sites of great battles. Some morbid gods, like Urgathoa or Xon-Kuthon, gather the bodies of the slain into horrific, conscious heaps to torment the living, being fickle in their maliciousness and refusing to let the torment and terror of battle die away with the fleetingness of mortal life. Other warmongering deities, like Gorum or Asmodeus, take a more personal hand in the outcome of mortal conflicts, and should their favored armies fall, they might raise them anew to again confront their foes. Yet in still other instances, the passions of battle and tumult of lost lives simply refuse to die away when a conflicts ends, and they are reanimated from the bodies of disappointed soldiers, giving terrible new life to their bloodlust and wrath. Regardless of what forces, divine or otherwise, animate these terrors anew, warsworns exist seemingly for the sole purpose of spreading the rage of war, ravaging the land, and spreading the carnage of battle cries and clashing steel. A single warsworn, composed of innumerable fallen humanoids, pieces of armor, and weapons, typically weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. Ecology As undead creatures, warsworns have no bodily needs, such as for food or waters, and they exist solely to destroy and cause chaos. Unknown to many, however, is the fact that warsworns often begin undeath at a much smaller size than is usually seen. Initially only as big as a common wagon, the unimpressive mounds shift across the warstained field from which they were born, rolling onto the scattered corpses and debris, consuming the sordid scene in a matter of hours, at which point they often reach their formidable, ordinarily seen size. Therefore, it is not uncommon for holy warriors, upon hearing news of a battle-stricken land allegedly infested by a warsworn, to rush to the site in the hope of overcoming the monster before it has time to reach its full potential. However, warsworns are frighteningly quick to grow, and most come to a kind of monstrous, unliving maturity before being destroyed. Once the battleground has been scraped clean of its dead, warsworns, never satiated, take to the surrounding area, searching hungrily for more dead to consume, and often invading small towns or villages to create the corpses themselves. They take ironic pleasure in destroying military settlements, bringing the wars of yesteryear roaring back to the unsuspecting people-a brutal, animate reminder that the dead never forget. Although warsworns have little concern for what or whom they destroy, they seem to favor consuming soldiers, victims of war, or at the very least those who die with blade and shield in hand-as if not just seeking new bodies to add to its monstrous girth, but also desirous of some remnant of rage or battle lust. Thus, while a warsworn will roll relentlessly onward and devastate with complete disregard, the unsatisfied monster is constantly searching for war-stricken lands, sites of conflict both ancient and fresh, so that it may satisfy its hunger with the broken steel and festering disease of the battlefield. Habitat & Society Warsworns can be found near areas that have seen great strife or war, especially battlefields, and sometimes make their way toward settlements close to such sites of human destruction. Warsworns, while intelligent, have little need for alliances, as their incredible size and strength provides all the muscle they require to wreak as much havoc as possible. Despite appearing as little more than a tide of zombies, these undead are driven on by more than mindless rage, retaining some communal memory of a soldier's tactics and a brawler's instincts. Proving to be surprisingly canny in battle, warsworns make use of every element of their necrotic bodies, including the splintered metal and rusting plates within their forms. The abominations have been known to launch great masses of rusting metal and shattered bone from their innermost hallows, balls of scrap propelled forth as if from a gigantic hellish catapult. Mof the creatures' grasping limbs also bear the remains of weapons, but such armaments rarely survive the undead thing's constant grinding motion, which reduces them to little more than lengths of dull metal amid the warsworn's thrashing, body-sized limbs. Unsleeping and unrelenting, warsworns are almost always on the move. Thus, warsworns might stop their rampage or even retreat for strategic means, waiting until nightfall to strike the people of a settlement near the site of a battle-the warsworns' most infamous and commonly utilized tactic. Farming communities located near vast stretches of fields that were once the site of a skirmish are often victim to warsworns' sudden, unpredictable attacks.",76800
Wasp Swarm,3,vermin,temperate forests,"A low, ominous buzz announces the arrival of a mass of mthousands of angry, stinging wasps.","A wasp swarm is a flying mass of thousands of carnivorous wasps. In such large numbers, they become voracious hunters, capable of taking down large creatures with their venom-filled stings. While a wasp swarm is capable of inf licting hundreds of stings, its true danger arises from its insatiable appetite for meat. Wasp swarms surround and attack living prey in their paths, and are swift to seek out new prey once their anger is aroused.

The are usually given the task of keeping secret or guarding an area underwaters as this is their native environment and they do not function well outside of it. A waters elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall, composed of waters. No discernable features can be seen on its head, though sometimes the face of an elemental spirit seems to appear randomly somewhere on its form. A waters elemental construct crashes down on its opponents with watersy fists before attempting to grab a foe and stuff it into its watersy form. An engulfed foe is held until it drowns; thereafter, the elemental construct expels the creature's corpse onto the ground. Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like other automaton follows order or command given to it to the best of its ability. An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person , but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

waters Naga,7,aberration,temperate waters,Slender spines and brightly colored frills stretch back from the humanlike face of this massive waters snake.,"With mottled scales of blue and green, waters nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at creatures that would disturb them. A typical waters naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds. Where mnagas claim particular lairs as their homes, waters nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coastlines throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, waters nagas typically attack that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all. As their yearly treks make mwaters nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs- usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most waters nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some waters nagas does not extend to the entire race, and munwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.",3200
waters Orm,10,magical beast,lakes,A reptilian head on a serpentine neck slowly surfaces. Shadows beneath the waters hint at a body of considerable size.,"Just as sailors tell stories of sea serpents, so do denizens on the shores of remote lakes whisper of strange, secretive monsters lurking in the depths of these large bodies of waters. Like sea serpents, proof of their existence is as elusive as the beasts themselves. Known as waters orms and believed by some to be a strange link between linnorms and sea serpents, most locals refer to such local monster  by a pet name or the name of the lakes it calls home. waters orms are craftier than sea serpents, and generally inclined toward curiosity rather than violence. Nevertheless, a waters orm does not hesitate to attack creature it views as a threat to itself or its lakes. waters orms are extremely long-lived. Several different variants have been reported. With sightings rare and unverifiable, it is unclear whether these are variations within a single species, or several unrelated creatures. Some are described as long-necked waters reptiles, some as fresh-waters sea serpents, others as bizarrely elongated seals or whales, and still others as impossibly large sea horses. Most are 40 to 45 feet in length, and weigh 2,000 to 3,000 pounds.",9600

Their bodies are long and narrow, with an individual measuring less than 1 inch in length. The body and legs of a waters strider are covered with a layer of waters-repelling hairs, making it possible for the strider to resist the surface tension of the waters. The insect stands on its front and rear legs, and pushes against the waters surface with its middle legs to propel itself forward. waters striders are also excellent jumpers, launching themselves distances of up to 5 feet. Any movement on land is limited to jumping. Swarms of particularly vicious waters striders commonly gather at the edges of bodies of waters, attacking anything that disturbs the surface of their pools.",400
waters Wraith,2,magical beast,warm rivers,"This eight-legged lizard has a round, lamprey-like mouth full of teeth, and its scales slowly change color to match its surroundings.","waters wraiths are eight-legged amphibious lizards indigenous to the Mwangi Expanse with the ability to change their color at will. This chameleon-like ability, combined with their superior intelligence, makes them coveted as exotic pets or guard animals. They are imported throughout Garund for those virtues. Patient and cunning hunters, waters wraiths prefer to lie still in ponds and rivers until their prey comes within range. When an unfortunate creature does, these fearless hunters strike, their webbed claws propelling them quickly forward either on land or in waters. Once their toothy, eel-like mouths attach to victims, waters wraiths quickly begin to bleed them dry. waters wraiths depicted here represent the upper end of size limitations for captive specimens. In captivity, these creatures are deliberately kept underfed and rarely grow beyond 2 feet in length. waters wraiths encountered wild in the Mwangi wetlands, or kept on an unrestricted diet, grow to even more massive sizes. Strange superstitions are born out of waters wraiths' color-changing powers. This changeability is not just an automatic defensive response, but can be a matter of self-expression, or even strategy and tactics on the part of the creature. waters wraiths often express likes and dislikes with an outward display of color: bright red is frequently associated with hunger, and dull green represents dislike or lack of interest. Some small communities in Katapesh and Osirion actually utilize waters wraiths in a primitive system of jurisprudence. The authorities release the accused into a pen with the creatures, then interpret the reactions of the lizards as signs of guilt or innocence. All too frequently, the wraiths declare the accused innocent by virtue of being delicious. waters wraiths find full-blooded elves to be unpalatable, but show no aversion to their half-elven cousins. waters wraiths are not limited to changing color in response to base drives, however.

Wax Golem,3,construct,any,"This eerily expressionless man has a glistening quality about him, as though he were completely covered in an oily sheen. His clothes' colors are unsaturated and bland, his skin slightly gray, and his features and lines unnaturally soft.","A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking, well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person. A wax golem can be constructed to resemble person or creature, though they typically look like human subjects, standing at the same height and weighing about three times as much. Ecology Wax golems are often constructed by artistic spellcasters who fancy making their work a little more authenticlooking. Though these golems can look like anything from faceless, colorless drones to finely detailed reconstructions, they all share the commonality of being formed purely from hard wax. Most wax golem crafters choose to create these lifelike statues not for aesthetic purposes, however, but to undertake devious chores such as infiltration, espionage, or assassination. Habitat & Society Wax golems possess the mysterious ability of possibly gaining self-awareness, an attribute almost exclusively reserved for humanoid creatures born of natural means. By resembling a subject so greatly, wax golems have a small chance of gaining conscious thought and higher-level thinking, effectively manifesting their own sentience. This extraordinary ability has no logical explanation, though some constructors of these beings who have witnessed this transformation theorize that wax golems obtain self-awareness by watching humanoids over an extended period of time. Wax golems that spend a significant amount of time around people who mistake them for the subjects they resemble  have an even greater chance of gaining sentience. Oddly, wax golems that gain sentience also develop the genuine belief that they are who they are modeled after. This notion is so strong that if such a wax golem were to encounter the individual it is modeled after, it would go to great lengths to exterminate the person and take his or her place in society, even adopting a code of morals and principles similar to those of the murdered subject. In this way, wax golems stealthily inject themselves into roles as diplomats, leaders, and authority figures, often to the detriment of people close to the usurped individual. So meticulously designed are wax golems, however, that few can identify a wax golem as a fraud, even when in close proximity. Along with sentience, wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep, or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this, wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing one person to get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift in demeanor. Environmental hazards such as heat from the sun or cold precipitation have little effect on wax golems, though constant exposure to temperatures over 100 degrees for more than an hour does produce a rather odd sheen, and spending longer than a day in such weather begins to take its toll on the golem, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage every hour spent in the elements after the first. Construction The construction of a wax golem requires a block of solid wax the size of whatever individual it is to be molded after, typically weighing over 1,000 pounds. The wax is treated with dyes and magical unguents worth at least 500 gp. The simplest wax golems require the creator to make a Craft  check, with wax golems resembling specific races or individuals requiring higher DCs. While wax golems that look like living creatures possess greater versatility, they also have the potential of gaining a strange sort of sentience.

Weaverworm,8,aberration,forests or hills,"The bloated white segments of a maggot's body erupt in a torso of mixed feminine and insectile features. Pale humanoid skin and carapace meld together beneath a face with segmented eyes and mandibles chittering a song of discordant alien clicks and hisses, as overlong carapace claws weave cords of thick webbing between them.","Foul servants of the goddess of disease and gluttony, weaverworms-or simply ""weavers,"" as they are often called-are terrifying abominations, combining the features of predatory insects, monstrously huge larvae, and deathly pale humanoids. Creations of Urgathoa forgotten by their cruel mistress long ago, these horrors seek out the dark places of the world, sowing murder and fear from the darkness, and all the while raising unnatural songs in praise of the goddess of gluttony. Weaverworms typically measure 18 feet long, though the most bloated weigh upward of a ton. Ecology A weaverworm's lower body is approximately 3 feet in diameter, and is divided into numerous segments that secrete a viscous film. The creature moves by expanding and contracting these segments, giving it an incredible range of motion, as well as the capability to scale surfaces with an ease equal to that with which they move across the ground. Weaverworms are also know for their claws' deadly nails, which function more like the stingers or barbs of minsects than weapons alone. These nails contain a potent paralytic fluid that passes into the bloodstream of a weaverworm's victim, leaving it vulnerable to slaughter and ready for consumption. The nails often break off while embedded in the victim's body, where they continue pumping the weaverworm's toxins, filling potential meals with dose after dose of paralytic excretions. Occasionally, those who encounter a weaverworm and flee find themselves paralyzed well after they think they've escaped, again falling into the deadly clutches of the pursuing abomination. The flesh of the creature's underbelly is relatively soft and slightly rubbery, running in shades of sickly brown flesh to pale blue. The exposed carapace is tougher and dotted with thousands of short bristles. Over time the weaverworm adjusts to match whatever environment it dwells in. The upper portion of the creature has a female body, but one disfigured by insectile traits. Such monstrous malformations vary between weavers, though all have deadly claws and heads with a terrible assortment of mandibles, pincers, spines, and segmented eyes. Typically, these appearances are similar to the faces of predatory insects common to the region the weaverworm inhabits, with spider features proving most prevalent, but the visages of horrible mantises and monstrous annelids also arise in warmer climates. Habitat & Society Much like larger arachnids, weaverworms are chief ly ambush hunters. They live in solitary burrows, near or within old ruins and similar places that tend to attract prey. While they tend to avoid colder climes, they prove resilient to most extremes of weather and terrain, tending to choose somewhat isolated areas where their hunting goes unnoticed. Typically, once a weaverworm claims a burrow, she remains there for life. In this manner, weaverworms are largely consistent, enough so that they frequently catch the attention of primitive humanoids such as goblins, orcs, or, in particular, ettercaps who believe them the embodiment of various gods or fiends and pay them worship. The relationship between weaverworms and their worshipers tends to be brutal, as weaverworms have few qualms about eating worshipers who come too close. Origins Among the vast libraries of mysteries and ancient legends documented and passed on by the faithful of Pharasma is the tale of Lamia of Avalos, a seer of Pharasma from a distant land who blasphemed against the goddess and was transformed into a beastlike creature denied the judgment promised sentient beings in death, as were her sister sibyls. Yet this punishment unleashed greater terror than even the Lady of Graves might have imagined. Unknown to the furious goddess and her false worshipers, another divinity had noticed the tragic drama. Urgathoa, goddess of disease and undeath, watched and laughed at the terror wrought by the goddess of prophecy upon her vicious servants. Delighted and inspired, Urgathoa went into the world to wreak a similar horror. The Pallid Princess searched the world over, and among her servants living and undead, found none who displeased her enough to curse as Pharasma had her priestess. So she turned her mind toward granting a rare and terrible blessing. Deep in a tangled forests she happened upon a brood of maggots and lowly worms, and in them found all she delighted in-filth and disease, hunger and life amid the dead. Momentarily delighted, she raised up this terrible swarm and molded them and gave them a single body, terrible but not unlike her favored daughters. The result was a monster, a servant of hungers and foul dooms, part grotesque insect, part poisonous fanatic. And the goddess was pleased. Yet Urgathoa is a fickle goddess; her momentary pleasure soon passed, and she left her terror in the forests, content to let it praise her, yet unwilling to care for its needs or safety. So the weaverworm crawled through the forests, insane and terrifying, preying upon what she could and sowing new generations in fits of atrocity-all the while plucking out Urgathoa's praises upon strands of deadly webbing.",4800
Well Lurker,9,aberration,underground,An open well-like hole surrounded by a crenellated edge hides the devouring mouth and lashing tentacles of this creature.,"These creatures make their homes in crevasses and carved dungeon pits. This creature has developed a keen natural camouflage making them appear as a freshwaters well carved into subterranean lairs. The entire well is in fact the beast with tentacles and devouring mouth drawn five feet beneath a rocky collar which protrudes from the ground. Well lurkers are opportunistic and passive hunters, rarely seeking out their meals; they simply wait for something to wander too close to them and then strike. If food becomes scarce or the area around a well lurker's lair becomes devoid of life, it uproots itself and moves to a new location. Such occurrences are rare however as the well lurker can go months without eating . A typical well lurker covers a 10-foot area, though specimens covering as much as a 30-foot area have been reported. A well lurker's tentacles are deep brown in color and about 10 feet long . Its maw is dark brown and ringed with msmall tentacles. It can draw its grasping tentacles into its form and fold its mouth tentacles backwards inside its maw, thus appearing for all intents and purposes as an ancient stone well. Animals can detect the unnatural presence of a well lurker and are generally nervous in its presence. Unless forced, an animal does not approach closer than 10 feet to this creature. This monster's tactics are simple. It waits for beings to attempt to draw waters from the apparently bottomless depth before lashing out with tentacles, attempting to draw prey into its fanged mouth, biting and devouring foes whole. Cutting oneself out from the well lurker is nearly impossible as they brace their girth against solid stone, meaning one would have to climb out through the mouth of the beast in order to escape certain death and painful digestion.

Wendigo,17,outsider,cold,"This hideous shape has the head of a feral elk with jagged teeth and sharp antlers. Its humanoid legs end in blackened, burnt stumps.","Beings of ancient evil, wendigos haunt the minds of mortals, driving them to desperation and, ultimately, cannibalistic madness. They enjoy whittling down prey before they strike, trailing victims for days, even weeks, while plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather. Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual cannibalism. They mark a wendigo's territory with fetishes and dress in the furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take little interest in the practices of their worshipers, and view them only as an ample supply of victims.",102400
Werebat,3,humanoid,temperate forests or hills,"This sharp-featured, angular humanoid has protruding fangs, a scruffy-haired body, and thin, membranous tissue connecting its arms to its sides.","Fusing the primal thirst of the ravenous bat and the unique abilities of individual humanoids, the werebat is a hybrid creature constituting both bloodlust and cunning. As opposed to vampires, who share some similar abilities with werebats and are often confused with them, these lycanthropic beings are often more savage in their behavior and far less calculating than the shapeshifting undead. As though to prove a point, some werebats go out of their way to take down powerful vampire lords and commandeer the vampires' higher position-though malso become slaves to such undead after underestimating their prowess. Natural werebats typically look like normal members of their race, though they often have dark hair, slight frames, severe features, and slightly pointed ears. They typically stand slightly taller than normal for their race, but weigh significantly less. Ecology Werebats exalt in the freedom of flight and delight in the taste of flesh. Whereas some lycanthropes try to maintain some sense of humanity while living with their condition, werebats are less inclined to do so and tend to abuse their powers. Their hunger for blood and the chaos often resulting from such impulsions tend to make wholesome living difficult for werebats, and so most simply give in to their bestial natures. Those who wish for a less gruesome and more respectable lifestyle are in constant struggle with forces both internal and external to themselves. Natural werebats can control their primal urges, but are subject to the corrupting atmosphere that is werebat society, always under pressure to submit to the inf luence of a werebat master. Aff licted werebats have it far worse, their bodies in constant conf lict with themselves in addition to the external forces urging them to give in. One of the most telltale signs of a werebat is blindness- about half of natural werebats are born with poor vision and need strong spectacles, and some are even completely blind. They make up for this def iciency with other heightened senses, however, and possess sharp hearing as well as strong senses of taste and smell. In cultures where it does not behoove one to have a lycanthropic background, werebats with poor vision tend to simply go without glasses, as their keen ears are more than able to compensate. Of course, the most obvious sign of werebat lycanthropy appears beneath the full moon, when an aff licted werebat cannot help but transform into its bestial shape. Werebats in animal form are far more savage looking than average bats, and resemble their dire cousins to a greater extent. Habitat & Society Werebats possess a pack mentality akin to their bestial kin's, and are able to fly in large, coordinated packs and execute complex maneuvers easily and agilely. This instinctual group dynamic manifests itself in both lycanthropic and humanoid form, the surrounding society ref lecting this pack mentality in legal as well as civil configuration. Entire packs of werebats often live in close proximity to one another, and sometimes even entire towns fall to the power of the winged lycanthropes. Almost always serving a higher master and subscribing to an unspoken understanding of ""one for all,"" werebats place great importance on meetings and gatherings, holding such events at barren locations such as caves and abandoned castles where the horde will be undisturbed. These gatherings are largely ornamental in purpose and merely provide the afflicted individuals with some sense of unity rather than being a means to constructive end. Nevertheless, it is a great taboo in werebat culture to show disrespect toward collaborative efforts or to each other during assemblies, and infighting is met with harsh punishment. Turning an individual into a werebat is not ritualistic or organized by means, unlike other facets of werebat culture. Werebats themselves feel indifferent about transforming unaffected individuals into aff licted werebats; the disease is spread more often because a werebat doesn't have enough time to finish slaying her victim before she is caught mid-act or her prey has otherwise escaped her, carrying a cursed scratch as a memento of the occasion. Only later does the individual realize what has happened, and usually too late. In paranoid societies, the horror upon realizing one's own transformation is usually matched with self-loathing and sometimes even drastic measures such as suicide-for in certain regions werebat-hate is so strong that it is easier to simply end it oneself than face the imminent and almost always malicious persecution of one's peers.",800
Werebear,4,humanoid,forests,This humanoid is covered in shaggy fur and carries a heavy axe in one of his clawed hands.,"In their humanoid forms, werebears tend to be muscular and broad-shouldered, with stark facial features and dark eyes. Their hair is usually red, brown, or black, and they look like they are used to a lifetime of hard work. Though by far the most benign of common lycanthropes, werebears are shunned by most normal folk, who fear and mistrust their animal transformations. Most live as recluses in forestsed areas or in small family units among their own kind. They avoid confrontations with strangers but do not hesitate to drive evil humanoids out of their territory. Some werebears are angry and violent, because of either temperament or a lifetime of harassment from others, and these mean ones aren't afraid to put an axe in a trespasser's face or eat someone who pushes them too far. Cool-headed werebears don't like to speak of these individuals with strangers.",1200
Wereboar,2,humanoid,forests or plains,This potbellied creature has the body of a man and the head of a crazed boar. Large tusks jut from his upper jaw.,"In their humanoid forms, wereboars tend to be stout with upturned noses, bristly hair, and a noticeable overbite. They usually have red, brown, or black hair, though a few are golden blond, pale blond, or even bald. Chin whiskers are common, but males often can't grow full beards. Because they can be stubborn and aggressive when riled up, wereboars usually live in their own communities rather than mixing with non-lycanthropes; a wereboar's farm or ranch doesn't look out of the ordinary. Wereboars tend to have large families with mchildren. Mwereboars are known to have especially bad tempers, rivaling those of murderous werewolves, and even other lycanthropes tend to avoid them. This suits the wereboars fine, especially as some weretigers and werewolves have been known hunt young wereboars. Note that the statistics presented here for wereboars assume that the creatures are in their barbarian rage-if the creatures are encountered at another time, simply adjust their statistics accordingly.",600
Werecrocodile,3,humanoid,warm rivers or marshes,"Standing taller than a man, this humanoid figure wears filth-covered rags over cold, scaly skin, its crocodilian maw displaying razor-sharp teeth reeking of rotting flesh.","Werecrocodiles merge the ruthless determination of a crocodile with the intelligence and adaptability of a humanoid, creating a maliciously cunning creature with no doubt of its martial superiority. Lacking culture or society beyond what can be gained through physical might, these creatures are solitary hunters. Natural werecrocodiles usually stand taller and broader than an aff licted member of their species. In humanoid form, specimens often have a slight rigidity to their skin, a green tinge around their lips, or vertically slit pupils. The average male werecrocodile in human form stands 6 feet tall and has a powerful, muscular frame weighing up to 250 pounds, with females averaging slightly shorter and lighter. Ecology Most werecrocodiles prefer warm rivers, coastlines, and swamps-ideally within a day's travel of a humanoid community where they can stalk new victims. They favor fresh humanoid kills, but they also eat fish, small watersfowl, or anything else they can chase down and kill. Voracious predators, these creatures either kill and eat or otherwise drive away most other local, predatory species. Werecrocodiles delight in the power their forms give them over others and enjoy nothing more than terrorizing their prey before the kill. Such creatures often pose as rivers guides or experienced woodsmen in order to lead their chosen targets away from the safety of civilization. Once in the wild, a werecrocodile prefers to take the first opportunity it can to maim its victim before allowing the prey to escape. It then hunts the poor soul down, dragging it into the waters and drowning it, then either devouring it or stashing the body in a mudbank for a later meal. Werecrocodiles often join groups of adventurers in hopes of just such opportunities. If its secret is discovered before the trap is sprung, a werecrocodile fights until the tide of battle turns against it, then flees to stalk its chosen victims from a distance. Habitat & Society While werecrocodiles typically enjoy the solitude of their territories, small colonies of them can sometimes be found scattered throughout isolated swampslands. Most stories suggest that it takes a particularly strong and malicious werecrocodile to hold others of its kind in sway. Despite the believed preference for solitude, when these creatures do come upon each other, conf lict is rare. As long as they heed one another's territorial boundaries, individuals hold an underlying tolerance of each other. However, when conf lict does arise between werecrocodiles, such battles are typically to the death. Any dispute relating to territories or mates has only one rule: the victor may do as he wishes with his prize. This amuses female being fought over, as even when a challenger defeats an opponent, if the female is unamused or unimpressed, she often simply kills the victor and feeds on his remains before going on her way. The borders of werecrocodile hunting grounds are adorned with skulls slung together with varying forms of waters vegetation and hung from trees along or across watersways. These blatant displays serve a dual purpose: to warn away potential encroachers and to evoke fear and anxiety in intelligent prey as soon as they enter the lycanthrope's territory. A werecrocodile's prowess correlates directly with the size and number of the skulls displayed on the borders of its territory. In areas where werecrocodiles are know to lair, locals often treat strangers met alone in the wilderness with extreme distrust. In some communities, a wanderer that approaches without first displaying an object of silver worn against the skin is shunned, or attacked outright if he seems aggressive. Because of their fascination with the power that their forms give them over lesser races, werecrocodiles rarely turn others into lycanthropes. Any aff licted werecrocodile was able enough to escape his hunter and survive whatever wounds he suffered. Aff licted werecrocodiles are often more malicious and cruel than their natural brothers, masking their self-loathing and despair with bloodsoaked acts of violence. Whether due to the werecrocodiles' unremitting despair, or their inability to control their alternate form's lust for violence and blood, these rampages end only with the death of the werecrocodile or the death of all innocents that the beast can find.",800

Werewolf,2,humanoid,land,This muscular creature has a man's body but the snarling head and fur coat of a wolf. XP 600,"In their humanoid form, werewolves look like normal people, though some tend to look a bit feral and have wild hair. Eyebrows that grow together, index fingers longer than the middle fingers, and strange birthmarks on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted indications that a person is in fact a werewolf. Of course, such telltale signs are not always accurate, for such physical traits exist in normal people as well, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, the traits can be damning regardless. Of all the various types of lycanthropes, it is the werewolf that is the most widespread and the most feared. Stories of werewolves haunting lonely forests roads, prowling misty moors on the outskirts of rural societies, or dwelling in the shadows of the largest cities are widespread as well. In most societies, werewolves are feared and despised-and with good reason, as the typical werewolf personif ies all that is savage and bestial in a lycanthrope. This isn't to say that good-aligned werewolves are unknown, but they're certainly a minority among their kind, and most werewolves are evil murderers who delight in the hunt and the succulent taste of raw meat. Just as wolves are pack animals, werewolves have been known to gather in colonies and live among their own kind, humanoid by day and beast at night. Visitors to werewolf villages are generally rushed out of town before nightfall so as not to discover the citizenry's dark secret-unless, of course, the pack decides that the unlucky visitor won't be missed by friends back home.",600
Whale,10,animal,oceans,"This immense whale moves slowly through the waters with a grace that seems incongruous, given its immense size.",Whales are frequently hunted for their meat and the valuable oil in their blubber.

Whip Jelly,2,ooze,underground,This creature looks like a squirming mass of bluish-gray slime with several long writhing tentacles protruding from its form. Veins of dark blue and black snake through its protoplasmic form.,"A whip jelly, like most oozes, is a mindless hunter that spends its time prowling the subterranean world for food. Rarely encountered near the surface, the deeper one goes in the Under Realms, the more likely an encounter with one of these creatures is to occur. Whip jellies lair in darkened dry areas. They have a natural disdain for waters . Their lairs contain the remains of past meals and possibly treasure or belongings  that the meal happened to be carrying at the time of its demise. A whip jelly looks like a bluish-gray quivering pile of goo with four long slimy tendrils jutting from its form. The creature's body is rather thick and resilient . Its tendrils are a bit darker in color than its main body. Shoots of dark blue and black through its body give the appearance of veins. A whip jelly attacks by whipping and striking its foes with its long slimy tentacles. A slain creature is slowly digested by the jelly over a period of days or weeks .

Whirlmaw,8,aberration,warm deserts,"This creature glides on undulating folds of leathery skin. Its spinning, circular mouth is lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth.","Predators of the deep deserts, whirlmaws are just one of the mdangers posed to those who travel the dry wastes of inner Rahadoum. Little more than flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home nestled in shallow burrows beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as their eyes. These bizarre hunters prefer to burrow into the torsos of their victims and consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses' peripheral parts for scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it. The skeletal remains of whirlmaws' victims can be identified by the suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety. The green, gemlike eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic and dangerous treasures in the deserts. It is speculated by some that these mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw's natural fire immunity, and alchemists and wizards often use them as components in creating magic items that bestow that form of energy resistance.",4800

Widow Creeper,13,plant,temperate forests,"This creature resembles a monstrous spider about twice the size of a human constructed of weeds, vines, and leaves. Two writhing tentacles sprout from its spider-like body, each ending in a sharpened point. An hourglass-shaped pattern of leaves and brush can be seen on its back.","Widow creepers are spider-like plant creatures that make their lairs deep in tangled forests. They constantly harass woodsmen, forestsers, and denizens of the forests from their weed-like webs which they spin high in the tree tops. Widow creepers spend much of their time in their nests, venturing forth only to feed, and even then, they rarely venture far from their lair. They prefer to lure potential prey to them by rustling nearby leaves or underbrush. A widow creeper sustains itself on a diet of brain fluid and blood. Corpses drained of blood and fluids are left where they fall; the widow creeper does not devour the flesh, bones, or muscle of its prey. A widow creeper is 8 feet tall and looks like a giant black widow formed from leaves, weeds, and tangled brush. It is dark greenish-brown in color. Two long, sinewy vine-like tentacles protrude from its body and aid the creature in capturing and securing its prey. A widow creeper utters no sounds and cannot speak known languages. Widow creepers are ambush hunters, waiting in their vine-like webs for a creature to pass nearby. When a potential meal comes close to its nest the widow creeper leaps from hiding and attacks. It uses its tentacles to either slash its foe or grapple it. Against a grappled foe, a widow creeper stabs one of its long tentacles into the opponent's head and attempts to drain its brain fluids. While grappling a foe, the widow creeper uses its control plants and entangle attacks to keep other opponents at bay. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",25600
Wight,3,undead,any,"The flesh of this walking corpse is rotting and putrid, its body skeletal in places and its eye sockets glowing with red light.","Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy. As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwaters, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as waters elves or merfolk. Underwaters wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability. The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants. Brute Wight : Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own. Cairn Wight : Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack. Frost Wight : Wights created in cold environments sometimes become pale undead with blue-white eyes and ice in their hair. Frost wights have the cold subtype and their slam attacks deal 1d6 cold damage in addition to the normal effects. A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage.",800
Wight Lord,9,undead,any,"This nearly skeletal figure wears the ancient armor of a long-dead king, and carries itself with a sort of regal pride.","Dark princes and warlords of old, wight lords are undead monarchs. Where typical wights rise from a wide variety of individuals, wight lords rise from the bodies of despotic rulers or ruthless generals. Wight lords haunt the same ancient burial grounds and battlefields their lesser kin dwell in, but wight lords aren't satisfied by simply guarding their haunts against the living. They continue their reign as tyrants in death, ruling over undead armies and often compelling their unliving minions to wage war upon nearby towns or cities, sometimes even at the behest of bold and powerful necromancers. The statistics that are presented above represent the minimum power level of a wight lord. A wight lord can rise from the remains of cruel or sadistic leader, but those who were higher than 11th level when they perished retain some of their previous life's knowledge-although not all of it. When this occurs, subtract 11 from the creature's previous number of class levels to determine the total number of class levels the wight lord possesses. Assign these class levels to the wight lord in a logical way-if it was a single-classed NPC in life, simply add more levels of that class to the wight lord. Multiclassed characters and those who possessed levels in prestige classes require more creativity in applying the class levels. The goal for building such a wight lord should be to approximate the themes and general abilities the creature had in life.",6400
Will-o'-Wisp,6,aberration,swamps,"This faintly glowing ball of light bobs gently in the air, the nebulous image of what might be a skull visible somewhere in its depths.","Every trapper and bog farmer living near marshes or swamps has his own name for these faintly glowing balls of light-jack o' the lanterns, corpse candles, walking fires, pine lights, spooklights, rushlights-but all recognize them as dangerous predators and false guides in the darkness. Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o'-wisps delight in tempting gullible travelers into dangerous situations. In the wild lands where they're most common, will-o'-wisps favor simple tactics like positioning themselves over cliffs or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for lanterns , allowing them to lure unwary travelers into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o'- wisps seeking easier pickings will move into a city and take up residence near gallows or follow along invisibly behind an army in order to harvest the fear of the dying men; why the vast majority choose to remain in the swamps where victims are scarce remains a mystery. Will-o'- wisps only use their electric shock ability under extreme duress, preferring to let other creatures or hazards claim their victims while they float nearby and feast. Will-o'-wisps can glow color they choose, but are most frequently yellow, white, green, or blue. They can even vary their luminosity to create patterns-mwill-o'- wisps are fond of creating vague skull-like shapes in their glow to further terrify their victims. Their actual bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material 1 foot across and weighing 3 pounds, capable of emitting light from every surface. A will-o'-wisp's light is approximately as bright as a torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies rapidly to simulate speech. While vilif ied by most other sentient creatures, will-o'-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly alien in their reasoning. Sometimes organized into groups called ""strings,"" their society and goals remain complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their origins, though they have sometimes been known to strike bargains with those who can offer them vast quantities of appropriately frightened victims. As will-o'-wisps do not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by violence, particularly ancient will-o'-wisps can serve as fantastic repositories of knowledge from the ancient past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in and of itself.",2400
Willow Dusk,14,plant,temperate forests,You see a 20 foot tall willow tree with dark greenish-brown branches and blackish-brown bark.,"Willow dusks are nocturnal predators that drone their targets into a lethargic state or a coma-induced sleep before relentlessly attacking and devouring them. To the untrained eye, a willow dusk appears as a normal willow tree and nothing more. Any creature with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge  or Survival can detect ""something's not quite right about that tree"" on a successful DC 20 check. A willow dusk prefers to devours a victim whole, scooping it up in its massive branches and dumping it fully into its gaping maw where its stomach acids digest its swallowed prey. Willow dusks prefer warmblooded creatures to cold-blooded creatures and always eat freshly killed prey. They are not scavengers and will not eat something they didn't kill . A willow dusk appears as a 20-foot tall willow tree and can grow to a height of 40 feet or more. A typical willow dusk is 20 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. Occasionally, willow dusks have been known to aid evil-aligned druids and rangers. A willow dusk hunts at night, just as the sun is setting. When it finds a potential victim, it looses its droning and charges an opponent who succumbs to its effect, bashing it with a slam attack or grappling it and tossing it into its maw. Creatures who resist the willow dusk's droning are subjected to its aura of misery attack as long as they remain within 10 feet of the creature. An opponent that falls to Charisma 0 is quickly scooped up by the willow dusk and devoured. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",38400

Wind Yai,16,outsider,temperate mountains,"A third eye rests on the forehead of this ornately robed giantess, her figure half-shrouded in the darkness of a starry night that swirls continuously about her.","Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that mliken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature. Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the skies to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes. A wind yai is 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds. Ecology A wind yai does not appear to walk upon the ground so much as glide across it-but even then, its exaggerated movements and overbearing demeanor make every footstep a thunderous stomp. An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural acts of destruction. Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring them crashing back to the earth. Habitat & Society Cloud giants possess one other thing wind yai yearn to claim mastery over-their instruments. But rather than use such delicate tools to create melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate, they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare, magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies. Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the more satisfying.",76800

Witch Tree,11,plant,temperate forests,"A witch tree combines the features of a tall, beautiful woman and a willow tree looking somewhat like a female willow treant. Her hair and fingers form the fronds of the willow, her arms and parts of her hair, the branches. From a distance, the witch tree is almost indistinguishable from a normal willow tree. Its skin is thick and dark, resembling the bark of a tree. Its legs join together to form the roots.","Witch trees gain nutrients from the soil where they take root, but have a particular fondness for living flesh, particularly that of gnomes and orcs. As such, groves of these creatures can be found lairing near such settlements. The origin of the witch tree is clouded; on one side, sages argue that the witch tree is a magical creation created by an insane spellcaster to do his personal bidding. On the other side, sages argue that the witch tree resulted from miscast magic or is the result of ""magical leakage"" perhaps created when a spellcaster attempting to create a magical wand or staff or other such item failed in his endeavors and cast aside the item, thereby allowing what magic it held to ""leak"" out into the surrounding soil. Regardless of the origin, the creature has multiplied significantly in numbers and shows no signs of becoming extinct anytime soon. Some adventurers tell tales of a witch tree grove that lured the entire population of a small village to its death through magical charms and hexes. Such stories are not without merit, and most intrepid adventurers warn others of their kind when a witch tree grove has been discovered. When a discovery is made, hunters, druids, and warriors move against the witch tree in an effort to remove the threat before villagers and livestock begin disappearing. A witch tree sits unmoving until a potential target moves within range. It first attacks using its spell-like abilities, attempting to charm or control its would-be assailants.

Witchfire,9,undead,swamps or woodlands,"Bathed in sickly green flames, this insubstantial specter of a beautiful young woman floats just off the ground.","When an exceptionally vile hag or witch dies with some malicious plot left incomplete, or proves too horridly tenacious to succumb to the call of death, the foul energies of these wicked old crones sometimes spawn incorporeal undead known as witchfires.

Wolpertinger,1,magical beast,temperate forests or hills,"This creature appears to be a large hare with long fangs, feathered wings, and a set of antlers.","Wolpertingers are a bizarre amalgamation of hare and bird with the antlers of a deer. A wolpertinger's mottled fur ranges from light browns and tans to nearly black. A pair of brown-and-tan feathered wings sprouts from its back. While on the ground, wolpertingers fold these wings tight to their bodies. Fierce predators, wolpertingers hunt in packs using clever tactics. While capable of flight, they find prolonged flight taxing and tend to stay on the ground most of the time. A wolpertinger has a 4-foot wingspan, is nearly 2 feet long, and weighs around 15 pounds. Ecology Wolpertingers are usually encountered in temperate forests and hills, though scarcity of their favored foods can sometimes drive them to warmer or colder climes. Though they are omnivores, wolpertingers prefer fresh meat to grasses and berries. They typically hunt creatures smaller than themselves , but often take on larger predatory animals, such as foxes. Given a large enough pack, wolpertingers can even take down a solitary wolf. Wolpertingers mate only once per year, in the spring. Kits stay with their packs until they are full-grown, but rarely remain with their birth-packs beyond a year, instead setting out to establish their own packs. Habitat & Society Though related to skvaders, wolpertingers are quite different beasts. Unlike their somewhat nomadic cousins, wolpertingers are aggressive and fiercely territorial. Packs stake out territories large enough for their hunting needs, and keep constantly vigilant against invaders. At the first indication of significant threat, the pack mobilizes and attempts to kill or drive off the intruders. This territoriality extends to different packs of wolpertingers, though multiple packs have been known to coexist peacefully near one another as long as none of them violates another pack's territory. When on the hunt, wolpertingers vary their approaches, from slinking through the underbrush to flying in from above, as befits the terrain and the capabilities of their prey. When approaching from afar, they charge in quickly to get close enough to deal a forceful attack with their horns. Once in close combat, they gang up on their prey in flanking pairs. The strongest and oldest wolpertingers focus on melee, leaving the younger members of the pack to dart in for quick charges. Given their antlers, it's difficult for wolpertingers to create burrows like skvaders and normal hares. Instead, they seek shelter in naturally secluded areas as well as in the former dens of larger predators. Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the compof their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.",400
Wolverine,2,animal,cold forests,"This stocky, muscular mammal is the size of a badger, its snarling lips revealing a mouth full of yellow teeth.","Wolverines are territorial, especially when it comes to food, and have been known to defend their kills against much larger predators, such as black bears. They are fearsome opponents, launching into a frenzy when wounded. They tend to give off a very strong, unpleasant musk smell when angry.

Wood Giant,6,humanoid,temperate forests,"Standing tall and graceful, this sharp-eared giant's skin is pale. Its large brow gives it a somewhat primitive visage.","Wood giants are the wardens of the deepest, wildest portions of the world's forests. Unlike mof their kin, wood giants are slow to anger, peaceful, and artistic, and display an infinite patience in their duty. A wood giant's role is to preserve and protect the wilderness-a role they believe that nature itself granted them, the proof of which manifests in their magical abilities tied to the natural world. Wood giant culture is as complex as their forests homes. Much of a tribe's time is spent tending to a forests's health: planting new trees, clearing away dead brush, and hunting abominations that pervert the natural order. Individuals may even cultivate their forests homes into elaborate demesnes, mazes, or living temples. They are an isolated race, only rarely meeting to trade with other tribes or the occasional elven settlement. While primarily good-natured, wood giants are distrustful of outsiders and prone to great melancholies. Small clans claim enormous tracts of wooded land, but rarely build permanent homes. Members may spread out over their entire region by day only to gather and bed down, exposed to the elements, after sundown. In harsh weather, tribes cluster close together in the densest thickets with their backs turned outward. Wood giants stand 14 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds. They are vegetarians by choice, resorting to eating meat only when no other option is available.",2400
Wood Golem,6,construct,any,This automaton is human-sized and resembles a ornately carved wooden statue.,"Arcane spellcasters used several ancient texts to arrive at a process to create inexpensive yet still quite powerful golems. They had master craftsmen create wood statues with articulating limbs and then performed the proper spells to animate and control them. The statues vary in shape and form and usually have weapons of some sort held in each hand. The wood golems were designed to act both as an alarm and a protection against intruders. Wood golems are usually programmed to close doors and avoid ranged weapons and spells but do not break off melee combat to avoid missile fire from other sources. They attack with their fists. Construction The pieces of a wood golem are assembled from blocks of fine wood and sprinkled with rare powders and crushed herbs worth at least 300 gp.

Shaped into the form of some inscrutable deity or spirit, its exotically carved features contort in a primeval scowl.","Among rare druidic circles, tribes of the deep jungles, and the mysterious people of the distant west, wood idols frequently serve as representations of powerful spirits of the wilds, who these nature devotees propitiate with sacrifices. The superstitions of strange shamans hold that spirits possess the idols when the sacrifices are made, consuming the offering before returning from whence they came. Yet those who would offend these forces must beware, as they manipulate eldritch powers of the world and might curse one's every effort. While mquestion the truths of such beliefs, few who impugn the might of such spirits survive the ire of their shaman-creators' devout congregations.",400
Woodwose,10,fey,temperate forests,This green skinned green haired figure has the appearance of a gnarled old man with skin like tree bark. Its hair and beard looks like Spanish moss with brambles and leaves knotted through it.,"The woodwose or green men are wicked male counterparts of the dryad. Guardians and protectors of forests and woodlands, woodwose have a cruel streak, feeling it better to bury an intruder amongst the trees than ever let them leave their forestsed sanctuaries again. Due to their malign nature, woodwoses do not associate with dryads, most sprites, or other benign woodland creatures. They do however sometimes form bonds and alliances with other evil fey creatures . Woodwoses have great magical powers like those of a druid, whom they seek to thwart and destroy when given the opportunity. A woodwose stands 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. Its skin is dark brown and rough and course to the touch. Its hair is dark greenishbrown. A woodwose's eyes are deep chestnut brown. Woodwoses primarily fight using spells and spell-like abilities. In melee combat they lash out with powerful slam attacks or use thick wooden clubs and cause great spines to sprout from their body after the manner of a porcupine.

Woolly Rhinoceros,10,animal,"cold or temperate forests, marshes or plains",This creature has massive legs and a stout body with a thick coat of brown fur. From the tip of its elongated nose rise two curving horns.,"The woolly rhino is a herbivore of the Pleistocene era feeding mainly on various plants, nuts, berries, and bark, as well as large quantities of waters. Thus, it is usually found in areas plentiful with waters, such as riversbanks, lakes, and even marshes and swamps. The woolly rhino usually forages in the morning so encounters are more common at this time. It is mostly a solitary creature though chance encounters at a common foraging area may lead to encounters with more than one creature. Herds tend to gather near watersing grounds with the females surrounding the young. Woolly rhinos mate during the late summer or early fall. Gestation lasts about 450 days after which time the female gives birth to a single calf. Calves are dependent on their mother for about the first two years of their life. Around three years of age, the calf becomes completely independent and reaches maturity by age five. The woolly rhino averages about 11 feet long and has two ivory horns, the longest averaging about three feet in length. Its body is covered in a thick layer of black, brown, ruddy, or yellowish-brown fur that enable it to withstand its harsh climate. The creature has poor eyesight, and relies on its senses of hearing and smell to locate sources of food and warn of impending danger. The woolly rhino is generally passive, but reacts violently if it or its herd is threatened. It attacks by goring and trampling its foes, often opening combat by charging its foe.",9600

Its fur is thick, and its underlying body is tough and very resilient. Its single horn is thick, ivory colored, and almost six feet long. Its fur tends to be a bit darker than the common woolly rhino's. Like its brethren, its eyesight is poor, thus it too relies on its keen sense of hearing and smell. The elasmotherium is a herding creature and encounters with herds are common. When danger presents itself, the females encircle the young, while the males charge the predator, goring with its horn.

A typical worg has gray or black fur, stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs 300 pounds. Worgs hunt in packs, running down and surrounding their prey like common wolves, but their intelligence and ability to speak make them better at coordinating their attacks. They sometimes use one packmate as a decoy, pretending to be a humanoid calling for help in order to lure intelligent prey into an ambush.

Worker Thermite,2,vermin,any,This creature looks like a giant reddish-hued termite. Immense heat radiates from its body.,"Thermites are extraplanar vermin that dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are rarely encountered anywhere else . Once in a rare while a gang or band of these creatures stumble through a vortex and sets up their nest on the Material Plane. Such a nest is always located near a massive heat source . On their home plane, thermites build large underground nests. The bulk of the colony is maintained by the workers-whose job it is to construct the nest, forage for food, feed the queen and soldiers, and repair the nest. Soldiers defend the nest against intruders and trespassers. About a week after the nest is finished, the queen takes a king  and they construct a reproduction chamber where she lays 10-20 eggs each day over a period of a week. Young thermites are helpless and depend solely on the queen and workers for food, protection, and so on. Young become independent after several months, and the reproductives  fly off to form their own nests. The cycle above then repeats.  Thermites are red in color and about 5 or 6 feet long with large biting mandibles and segmented antennae. Soldiers are slightly larger than workers and have slightly larger heads with oversized mandibles. The queen can reach a length of 12 feet or longer and as she ages, she becomes bloated, resembling a giant reddish colored maggot. Reproductives resemble workers and soldiers but are slightly darker in color and have translucent reddish wings. Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off would-be interlopers. Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.",600
Worm That Walks,14,vermin,any,"Although this robed wizard stands and moves like a man, his body is a writhing mass of squirming, slippery worms.","When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and a remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with eldritch magic, a strange phenomenon sometimes occurs. The flesh of the decaying body fats and instructs the very worms that gnaw, and these graveworms quicken not only on corruption but upon the spellcaster's memories and magical power. The spellcaster's very soul is consumed in this vile process, only to be split apart to inhabit each of the individual chewing worms in so mfragments. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known as a worm that walks-a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence, and can wield the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but is not undead-it is a hideous new form of undulant life. Creating a Worm That Walks ""Worm that walks"" is a template that can be added to evil spellcasting creature. A worm that walks retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The base creature's type changes to vermin. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Worms that walk are intelligent and do not possess the standard mindless trait of most vermin. Note that while a worm that walks has the ability to discorperate into a swarm, and while its body is made up of countless wriggling worms, it does not itself gain the swarm subtype. Size: Although the worms that make up the worm that walks's body are Fine creatures, the worm that walks is treated as a creature the same size as the base creature. Senses: As the base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet and blindsight 30 feet. AC: The worm that walks loses natural armor bonus the base creature may have had, but gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom bonus . Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. Defensive Abilities: A worm that walks retains all of the base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities. It also gains the following additional defensive abilities. Worm that Walks Traits: A worm that walks has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate -a worm that walks at 0 hit points is staggered, and one at negative hit points is dying. Worms that walk are immune to physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures , with the exception of such spells and effects generated by the worm that walks itself, which treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it so chooses. Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function normally against a worm that walks, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind. A worm that walks takes half again as much damage  from damaging area effects, such as fireball and splash weapons. Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds-treat a worm that walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects. Damage Reduction: A worm that walks loses damage reduction possessed by the base creature and gains damage reduction 15/-. Fast Healing: A worm that walks gains fast healing equal to its CR. Immunities: Worms that walk are immune to disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep effects. Melee Attacks: A worm that walks loses natural attacks the base creature had, but gains a slam attack that deals damage based on its size . This slam has the grab ability and affects creatures up to one size larger than the worm that walks. A worm that walks retains weapon proficiencies the base creature had. Special Attacks: A worm that walks retains all of the base creature's special attacks. It also gains the following additional special attacks. Discorporate  A worm that walks can collapse into a shapeless swarm of worms as a free action. All held, worn, and carried items fall and its Strength score drops to 1. The worm that walks functions as a true swarm while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet . While discorporated, the worm that walks loses all of its defensive abilities and gains all of the standard swarm traits. It loses its slam attacks and all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that deals damage equal to its engulf attack. A worm that walks can reform into its true form  as a fullround action as long as it has at least 1 hit point. Squirming Embrace  If a worm that walks grapples a foe, as a swift action, it can cause a swarm of worms to squirm over the grappled creature. These worms deal automatic swarm damage with no attack roll needed . If a creature takes damage from the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm's distraction ability, and must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 the worm that walks's HD + its Con modifier). A worm that walks can only have one embraced target at a time, but it does not have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the worm that walks moves more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the swarm , the swarm dies. Any area attack that damages the swarm or severe or stronger wind effect that affects the swarm's target kills it. Tenacious  A worm that walks gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD. Abilities: Dex +4, Con +4. Skills: Worms that walk gain a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats: Worms that walk gain Diehard as a bonus feat. Engulf Damage HD Engulf Damage 1-5 1d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 6-10 2d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 11-15 3d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 16-20 4d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 21 or more 5d6 + 1.5 Str bonus",38400

Wrath Dragon,20,dragon,good-aligned plane,"Beautiful and awesome to behold, this majestic dragon's skin glitters like precious metals and jewels, belying its unquestionable might and holy wrath.","These massive powerfully built specimens are formed from the ascension of slain good dragons into the heavenly orders. Given the opportunity to return, they serve as heralds of good-aligned deities sent to deliver divine judgment on infidels and sinners who have turned their back on the path of righteousness. A flight of wrath dragons over an offending city has often been cause to turn an entire civilization to prayer and piety. Wrath dragons never enter the Material Plane, inner planes, or other outer planes unless under orders from the deity they serve. When such orders are given, a wrath dragon completes its assignment to the best of its ability before returning to its home plane. A wrath dragon serves no one other than the deity that ""created"" it. It aids good-aligned creatures in time of need, but does not serve them or stay with them longer than is required to give aid . A wrath dragon never aids an evil creature under circumstances, and if forced to do so by magical means, the dragon seeks atonement as soon as possible. A wrath dragon is 30 feet long and weighs about 30,000 pounds. Its scales are silver or platinum and glitter under bright light. Its wings are silver-hued with a darker stripe running along the top portion. Its head, sitting atop its long serpentine neck, is long and angular and its eyes are seemingly made of sapphire. Two under-curved horns made of ivory jut from its head just behind its eyes. Wrath dragons start combat with use of their breath weapon and divine spells. They continue this tactic until pressed with missile fire, or magic that would force them to close in for melee attacks. In close combat, a wrath dragon attacks using a combination of its bite, claws, and spells. If pressed, or if the battle turns against it, a wrath dragon summons devas to its aid.

They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from. Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they occasionally hunt in small groups for large prey, they are generally solitary creatures, hunting in areas ranging in size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been known to fight to the death among themselves for the right to hunt a territory rich with prey. Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a wyvern that can be befriended  becomes a powerful ally. They often serve giants and monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk and boggard tribes even use them as mounts, although such arrangements are quite costly in terms of food and gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve as steeds for lesser creatures for long.

Every angelic being, every creature of good, and all that oppose Great Lucifer shall be consumed in eternal and everlasting fire. Xaphan. Xaphan, the Burning Duke, serves Lucifer, leading 15 companies of pit fiends in his service. He is completely loyal to the Prince of Darkness and was with Lucifer during the Unholy Schism. It was Xaphan that, during the Unholy Schism, attempted to set the heavens on fire and consume each and every angel and celestial in a blazing inferno. Xaphan was cast down along with Lucifer and the other angels for their sacrilege and it is said he helped Lucifer construct Hell itself. It is known among scholars that Xaphan was the one that stoked Hell's furnaces in Lucifer's great basalt palace, powering the furnaces with unholy fire fed by tortured souls. When Asmodeus and the other devils rose against Lucifer, Xaphan fought against the uprising and slew mdevils, even inflicting a near-fatal wound on Asmodeus himself.  In the end however, Xaphan was cast out of Hell along with Lucifer and now resides in Infernus, a pocket-plane of infernal and everlasting fires located somewhere in the great configuration. From Lucifer's great palace, Malefacta, Xaphan aids Lucifer in replenishing his forces and increasing his power with the ultimate goal being the reclaiming of Hell's Throne. And when the battle for Hell does come, Xaphan will be beside Lucifer once again-and this time, Mephistopheles won't be able to stop Xaphan from finishing off Asmodeus. Xaphan spends his days in Malefacta where he keeps a legion of hellstoker devils busy stoking the furnaces and a retinue of barbed devils forging weapons for the eventual war to reclaim Hell. Xaphan stands 13 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. Xaphan is a deadly adversary in battle and rarely, if ever, backs down from a fight. He is not stupid however, and should the battle go against him, he either flees  or summons a troupe of pit fiends to cover his escape. In battle, Xaphan unleashes his full fury against a foe; starting with his fiery gaze. Those that survive are then witness to his fiery aura power. If within range, he likes to grab a foe and hold on while using his fiery aura power.

Lurking beneath the surface for what might seem long stretches of time to humans, a xorn might wait months, even years, for the right treat to come along, assaulting the being carrying its favorite meal, such as a certain gemstone or the right sort of silver. Adventurers who frequent regions inhabited by xorns often carry with them small chunks of raw ore or relatively inexpensive gemstones or crystals to use as bribes. While the price of a gemstone or piece of metal is often in direct proportion to the object's flavor and desirability as a meal, most xorns are quite gluttonous and prefer quantity over quality when it comes to food Treasure found carried by a xorn or stashed in its lair amounts to little more than snacks set aside for another day. An offering of a particularly delicious  jewel or piece of precious metal can swiftly secure a xorn's temporary allegiance. Since xorns can swim through solid rock with ease, they make excellent guides in underground regions. Xorns grow in size as they age. The youngest xorns are approximately 3 feet in size, and can be represented by applying the young simple template to the statistics presented here. The most commonly encountered xorns are about 5 feet tall , while the largest are 8 feet or more and weigh upward of 9,000 pounds. These elder xorns are giant advanced xorns, but some even greater xorns exist as well, with upward of 15 Hit Dice. Often, an elder xorn possesses class levels as well. These creatures are generally leaders, heroes, or even outcasts or villains in xorn society. A classed elder xorn typically has levels in barbarian or rogue. Xorns aren't particularly religious, but those who do have deep faith are typically druids . Xorn bards and sorcerers are not unheard of either, with bards favoring Perform  as their focus, and sorcerers almost invariably having the Elemental  bloodline.",2400
Xtabay,0.5,plant,land,"This patch of vines is ornamented with beautiful crimson and violet flowers, the petals of which seem to bear tiny faces.","Attractive flowers blossom from the vines of xtabays, emitting the spores that mean a slow death for their victims. The strange, face-like patterns that grow on the petals are disturbing but seem to have no real function. Hermits or other reclusive types have been known to surround their territory with xtabays, warding off peskies creatures and adventurers alike. Instances of xtabays of larger-than-usual size have also been reported. These massive plants possess tendrils as thick as tree limbs and flowers that can fell even the hardiest of warriors with their overwhelming perfume. Underground, xtabays thrive in the wet, dark environment, covering the walls and floors of entire caverns and anesthetizing whole dens of subterranean creatures. Nomadic plants, xtabays traverse large expanses of land until they sense nearby life, at which point they lie dormant and take on the guise of harmless flowers while releasing their deceptive aroma. Once a creature is subdued, the beast-like plant wastes no time in devouring it, disregarding creatures unaffected by its aroma. Because of their carnivorous nature, xtabays only rarely run short on nutrients, consuming the entirety of a victim's body over the course of several days following the initial process of draining its blood. Xtabays are able to devour creatures thanks to their lengthy roots, which produce a corrosive acid that breaks down and absorbs flesh and bone.",200
Yamabushi Tengu,5,outsider,temperate mountains,"This humanoid creature has a fearsome mien, with a cruel red face, glaring yellow eyes, a prodigious nose, and large ravenlike wings.","Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery, wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since it's easy to be seen in such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where it can skulk in the shadows when it's unsure of its surroundings. A yamabushi tengu is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. Ecology While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles, peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and other billed avians  are notably absent from yamabushi tengus. In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducks-they find these birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks. The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy. Habitat & Society Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Mextend this obsession to clothing  and armor . Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian humanoids-particularly tengus, dire corbies  and garudas . Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters  are in strange ways both similar and quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creatures' feral natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control of-although in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a yamabushi tengu's minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the garuda prisoner. Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thieves' guilds-particularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other races , a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably the shapechanged oni's nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally don't think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others.",1600
Yamah,5,outsider,any,"This blue-skinned celestial has enormous butterf ly wings, and its black hair sparkles like a starlit skies.","Yamahs travel the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life. Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings that cover yamahs' bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are in fact natural sigils that are unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds. Because of the presence of the mystery cults in Magnimar and the open worship of empyreal lords-especially Ashava-yamahs can often be seen in this city during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events. Legends among these mystery cults claim that yamahs sometimes accompgood spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.",1600
Yamaraj,20,outsider,all,"This dragonlike creature has the features of a massive crow, its feathers as black as oblivion. Great, tattered wings bear it aloft as it glides effortlessly forward.","Equal parts regal and unspeakable to mortal sensibilities, yamarajes preside as judges of death and dispensers of ultimate justice. Superstitions of the living call them by mnames-the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men's souls-but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts. The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Pharasma's Boneyard, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners. Malso serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain the Boneyard's neutrality, but such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse. Though in theory each yamaraj answers to Pharasma, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom. Yamarajes vaguely resemble black dragons, though they are easily distinguished once one realizes the gigantic creatures are cloaked in feathers rather than scales. Each yamaraj measures at least 30 feet in length and weighs 4 tons. Despite their massive size and largely sedentary duties, yamarajes show astounding grace when they do move. Ecology Impossibly old, yamarajes are outsiders forged from lesser psychopomps or the souls of legendary mortals. As with other outsiders, they need not eat, drink, or sleep to survive, and the grave magistrates normally remain perched upon the Boneyard's ruins for months at a time, overseeing the smooth organization of their realm. Hard work wears at their immortal drive, and like living lords they eagerly indulge in exquisite banquets during their infrequent personal time. These bacchanals make for strange bedfellows among outsiders, as solars and pit fiends may hobnob alongside one another, vying for a yamaraj to help organize the release of judged souls and attempting to win future favors. When called into physical action, all yamarajes can breathe raw decay in the form of clouds of carrion-eating insects, and their venom saps the youth and vitality from living creatures. Habitat & Society Yamarajes serve as lower judges and lords of the Boneyard, directing the activities of their lessers, presiding over the dead, presorting souls destined for Pharasma's ultimate judgment, and seeing to the efficiency and safety of the Spire's infinite inhabitants. As the highest order of psychopomps, they are simultaneously the most dedicated to their role as shepherds of the dead and the most prone to impressing their own opinions on their work in the form of overturning precedents, rambling speeches, and extensive opinions attached to rulings. Such flexibility is necessary when making immortal decisions based on the ever-changing actions of the living, but frustrates more absolute outsiders to no end. Unsurprisingly, yamarajes tend to vary greatly from one individual to the next. Most develop deep interests in various worldly subjects that determine the sorts of mortals they ultimately seek to watch over. A given yamaraj might go out of its way to seek out artisans or followers of specific deities or thieves, depending on its studies or whatever has come to interest it during that eon. Yamarajes might seek to guard such pet souls, ensuring their safe travels through the Boneyard, learning more from the souls as they journey together, and ultimately advocating that Pharasma grant a more peaceful judgment. Others act in reverse, finding certain types of mortals disgusting, tormenting their souls through their procession to the goddess's throne, and even suggesting that the spirits should face particularly monstrous damnations. How a yamaraj reacts to an individual thus proves unpredictable, depending on its changeable tastes. Such idiosyncrasies vary between individual yamarajes, and might change over the course of centuries. Just as myamarajes become fascinated with souls possessing specific experiences or from certain backgrounds, some of the psychopomps go out of their way to judge beings from specific worlds, collecting bits of information and insight with every creature that passes them by. Thus, some become experts on one or multiple worlds, having spent eternities ferreting out the histories and secrets of worlds from firsthand accounts over millennia of inquiries. Myamarajes welcome the opportunity to share the details of their investigations. Others, though, see inquiries into their worlds of expertise as opportunities to aid the psychopomps' cause. Standing at the pinnacle of their race, yamarajes are well informed as to the challenges and goals of msubservient psychopomps, and might only negotiate with mortals who perform a service in aid of their underlings.",307200
Yamasoth,24,outsider,any,"Writhing, hook-covered tentacles unfurl from this behemoth's body, at the center of which gapes a maw with a red eye in its throat.","Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar- Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The ""new flesh"" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects- men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans . Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought. Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.",819200
Yellow Musk Creeper,2,plant,temperate or warm forests or underground,This plant is a large green clinging vine with ivy-like leaves of dark green. Small dark green bulbs and bright yellow flowers mottled with purple adorn the plant.,"The yellow musk creeper is a slow-moving plant that attacks living creatures and feeds on their Intelligence, eventually turning such creatures into yellow musk zombies. Creepers can be found in moderate to warm climates or underground, and are rarely encountered elsewhere. The actual root of the plant is a large bulbous, brown sac that lies beneath the surface of the ground where the yellow musk creeper grows. Yellow musk creepers lie silent until prey approaches within 10 feet. The small flowers of the creeper then puff a muskies-smelling fine powder at a single target, attempting to entrance the target. If attacked, a yellow musk creeper lashes out with its tendrils. Yellow musk creepers are never encountered alone. They always have a retinue of yellow musk zombies with them. These zombies will defend the creeper against all attacks.

Yeth Hound,3,outsider,any,"This emaciated, hairless canine has a strange air of menace and cruelty about it.","Yeth hounds are evil outsiders that delight in hunting intelligent prey. They lope through the night skies, relentlessly pursuing their chosen quarry for miles, and harrying them with their frightful baying. Yeth hounds hunt only at night. They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives depend on it. A yeth hound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 400 pounds. Yeth hounds do not collect treasure, having no use for such baubles. The thrill of the hunt and the sweet tang of fear in their prey is all they value. However, some items of worth may occasionally be found in a yeth hound den, the discarded remnants of prey dragged back to the lair. Despite their bestial appearance, the yeth hound is rather intelligent, even if it does little with its intellect but devise and carry out ingenious, hateful plans to torment and horrify its prey before it finally strikes. Yeth hounds can often be found in the compof night hags or evil hunters. Yeth hounds hate other canine monsters such as barghests and worgs, and attack them on sight if they have the advantage of numbers. They are often associated with particularly bestial demons, and can be found serving demon cults as guardians and trackers. A gift of a yeth hound companion to a particularly successful cult is sure sign of favor in the eyes of a demonic patron. A cult with yeth hounds granted to them in this manner must take care to retain this favor, for if they displease their demonic patron, the hounds could turn on them. Yeth hounds inhabit secluded dens in remote wilderness areas far from bothersome civilization. These dens are always subterranean, far removed from the hated sunlight. Yeth hounds range great distances from their dens during their nightly hunts, and have been known to carry kills for miles just for the comfort of consuming a fresh meal in their lair. The sight of a yeth hound loping through the skies with a body clenched in its jaws is unsettling indeed.",800

On such adventures, the intrepid dungeon dragon takes notes regarding the devious traps and monsters it encounters so that it can add such things to its own lair.

Young Sovereign Dragon,11,dragon,mountains,"This magnificent dragon is covered in splendid gold scales, and horns jut from its head like a crown.","Guardians of balance, sovereign dragons, or lungwangs as they are also known, were placed in the skies by the gods themselves to safeguard harmony in the world.",12800
Young Umbral Dragon,10,dragon,any,"This sleek, dark dragon moves with a disturbing, serpentine grace, its eyes glowing as if lit from within by crimson embers.","Cruel and sadistic, umbral dragons prefer the taste of undead flesh or ghostly ectoplasm, yet never turn down opportunities to consume living flesh.",9600
Young Underworld Dragon,7,dragon,underground,"This serpentine dragon has skin the color of deep volcanic rock, enormous claws, and jagged, stonelike horns and scales.","Underworld dragons-also called futsanglungs-are calculating, greedy creatures that carve great labyrinthine tunnels beneath the world, defending their hidden treasures. Preferring the earth to the heavens, they channel the fires of the world's core within their twisting, stonelike bodies and through flaming breath hot enough to turn granite into slag.",3200
Young White Dragon,6,dragon,cold mountains,"This dragon's scales are a frosty white. Its head is crowned with slender horns, with a thin membrane stretched between them.","Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountainstops and in arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals completely frozen.",1600
Yrthak,9,magical beast,"temperate deserts, hills, or mountains","This flying reptile has large, leathery wings and a vibrantly colored crest on its horned, narrow-snouted head.","Swift, cunning, and perpetually ravenous, the yrthak terrorizes the barren wastelands in which it makes its home, swooping down from on high to blast prey with bursts of pure sound. Though technically blind, as its eyes are tiny and barely capable of vision beyond a few feet, the yrthak senses its surroundings via acute hearing and echolocation. While its powerful jaws and claws are equally capable of taking down opponents, the yrthak generally prefers to wheel through the skies on its membranous wings, firing bolt after bolt of sound into its prey, and exulting in the thrill of the hunt. An adult yrthak is 20 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds. Yrthaks spend most of their time aloft-a yrthak hunt often lasts several days, with the yrthak skimming roughly 100 feet over the ground in its wide-ranging search for live prey, only resorting to grazing on carrion in direst need. While they have near-human intelligence, yrthaks generally do not seem interested in forming societies of their own-although the sight of a clutch of yrthaks tormenting a captured morsel might seem to indicate otherwise.",6400
Yuki-onna,8,undead,cold,This beautiful but sad-looking woman wears an ornate robe and is surrounded by a whirling mass of snow.,"A yuki-onna is the restless spirit of a woman who froze to death in the snow and was never given a proper burial. She roams the wilderness, constantly searching for intelligent creatures to kill and always appearing surrounded by swirling mists of snow and ice. Eternally jaded by her unjust departure to the afterlife, a yuki-onna seeks to impose the same cruel fate upon those who still live, particularly men and those who sympathize or cooperate with them. Mfoolish individuals are lured to their deaths by a yuki-onna's unparalleled beauty, which remains even as the evil spirit steadily freezes and kills her victims with her powers over frost. The transition from life to undeath corrupts a yuki-onna's soul, and even a well-intentioned, good-hearted individual who freezes in the snow may become a treacherous yuki-onna. Most yuki-onnas immediately seek out those who wronged them in life, after which they reside in an area near what was their home, haunting and killing anyone who dares to come near. Yuki-onnas hardly ever make their presences known in rural areas with larger populations, and they prefer inhabiting the countryside and wilderness. When a yuki-onna is destroyed, her body melts as though ice, leaving only a small pool of waters in its stead. A yuki-onna is 5-1/2 feet tall.",4800
Zelekhut,9,outsider,land,"This creature looks like a mechanical centaur. Golden, clockwork wings sprout from its back, and its arms end in barbed chains.","Zelekhuts are bounty hunters and executioners all rolled into one. They seek out those beings who continually evade justice-either through active flight, or through power and station-and bring law and justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Ironically, while zelekhuts are implacable and unrelenting in their duty, they have little interest in passing judgment of their own, a fact that often confuses other races. Rather, a zelekhut is content to enforce the laws of given society, and while it might hunt a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, it will not shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are 10 times worse, so long as the atrocities are within her technical rights as ruler. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to track down those who seek to flee their punishment.",6400
Zelishkar,21,outsider,any,This fiendish figure appears to be shaped from pure flame with a feline face. Three wicked tongues dart from the creature's mouth.,"The dread Zelishkar of the Bitter Flame is a figure much feared on the crumbling plains of Abaddon and across the multiverse. A monstrous feline in shape but seemingly sculpted of lurid crimson flame, Zelishkar is girded with a crest and cuirass of infernally strengthened obsidian, shaved to razor thinness yet losing none of its terrible strength. His eyes are jet-black pits that mirror his armor, though pinpoints of awful orange radiance gleam deep within. He is surrounded always by a heat shimmer that diffuses his blinding radiance. Zelishkar is reputed to sense the presence of his prey by the tiniest variations in temperature, tracking the movements of creatures both seen and unseen before he pounces. His own fires burn with a hellish uncleanness, tainting even those who thought themselves proofed against his flames and rapidly consuming their body and soul, leaving nothing behind but befouled ashes. Zelishkar is feared as much for his incisive tactical acumen as for his dreadful and terrifying powers in close combat. He has single-handedly withered and despoiled cities and farmlands when summoned in the name of his daemonic mistress-Szuriel, patron of war and suffering. She forged Zelishkar's form in the deepest pits of the Cinder Furnace as her terrifying harbinger, embodying the hopeless misery of funeral pyres that consume and cremate the dead in the wake of the war that she brings. He proved so adept that she judged him worthy to transcend his purpose, and he has come to embody all of the hateful and sadistic purposes that fire serves. His name is invoked now by torturers and inquisitors alike as they consign their hapless captives to the ultimate agonies of being burned alive, and even by arsonists both petty and grand. All twisted souls who love nothing more than to see the world burn offer up silent praises to Zelishkar in their hearts; even if they never speak his name, the hate that burns within them is a sweet savor in his nostrils. Zelishkar was summoned to Golarion in ancient times, during the height of Osirion's empire, and he led legions of flaming minions against the enemies of the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, notably the Jistka Imperium. In a twist of supreme hubris, the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues turned against his summoned ally after several successful campaigns, and chose Zelishkar to be the test subject of his grandest experiment yet. The Osirian king had just finished construction of a grand labyrinth south of the Alamein Peninsula, and in a display of prideful foolishness ordered Zelishkar to be imprisoned within to prove the infallibility of his maze. It took the efforts of an entire army of summoned genies to lock the daemonic harbinger away beneath the deserts's churning sands, but his imprisonment was absolute with the aid of an ancient efreeti and a legendary artifact known as the Bottle of the Bound. Through all the long millennia since, Zelishkar and the remnant of his host have remained imprisoned beneath the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh, the city founded by the Song Pharaoh upon her victory over the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues years after Zelishkar's detention. He has emerged from his prison but once, when Szuriel and the ironically named Incorruptible Pharaoh joined to loose his fiery fury upon one of the skies-cities of Shory. His destructive rampage could not be contained, however, and he devastated several cities and oases of western Osirion before he and his host were finally bound back within their prison. There he remains, plotting burning vengeance upon Osirion and all of Golarion for his ages of durance vile.",409600
Zeuglodon,9,animal,warm oceans,"This elongated, whale-like creature moves through the waters with an eel-like motion despite its wide, fluked tail. Razor-sharp teeth fill its almost reptilian mouth.","The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to whales and other cetaceans than either waters reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the waters with a vertical anguiliform  motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwaters for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.",6400

Zomok,16,plant,forests,"Resembling an enormous lizard composed entirely of organic plant matter, this beast shakes loose soil from its earthy wings and exhales dirt particles with every breath.","The First World's seasons are as random as other aspect of that strange realm, with summers lasting for years or winters passing in an afternoon. Mof the forests of that world, some of them surprisingly similar to those on Golarion, have difficulty coping with the unpredictable climate. These forests often survive only because they're inhabited by zomoks: plant-dragons that prowl the woodlands, defending them from the often destructive forces of that realm, and healing and regrowing vegetation as needed. Through the ages, some of these creatures have even traveled from the First World to inhabit the wilds of other realities, protecting the nature of such lands from disasters and axe blades just as tenaciously as they would in their homeland. No two zomoks look alike, and rarely does one creature look the same for long; parts of their bodies are constantly growing, dying off, and regenerating from nearby plants in an endless cycle. Most rise to a height of 18 feet and stretch at least 35 feet long, with wingspans of more than 80 feet and weights of 30 tons. Ecology A zomok is more than just a single creature, being closer to a collective spirit of the woodlands. One might step into one stand of trees and reform a new body elsewhere in the forests, the same creature but with a different body. The shape of a zomok is different each time it arises. On one occasion, it might pick a sturdy larch as its right foreleg and turn a weeping willow into its head; on another, it could have a body of oak and make its teeth from brambles and nettles. The overall shape is always draconic, but its components change, even from moment to moment. In truth, it is more a dragon-shaped wave moving through the forests-the trees bend momentarily into the dragon's body and limbs, but the wave passes on, leaving them intact in its wake. Zomoks do not need to eat and have no real digestive system. Any creatures they happen to devour whole are often found hanging in bloody gobbets from the topmost branches of random trees, though the hungry plants of the realm often consume the remains before they are ever found. In combat, zomoks prefer to keep moving, using their tree stride ability to ensure that no one stand of trees takes the brunt of the injuries. To protect their habitat, zomoks breathe a raging torrent of thorns, twigs, chunks of bark, and clouds of moss that envelops those in its path, encasing them in a thick shroud of organic matter. Those slain by the breath weapon are instantly decomposed into rich loam; even those who survive often find mold growing on their skin or small plants sprouting from their hair or ears, with each tendril trying to root the creature into the earth. Zomoks can also control the terrain, turning the land into a swamps or conjuring defensive walls. When need be, they can quench flames at will-a useful talent for a creature so vulnerable to fire. When facing powerful foes, zomoks create mighty walls of briar and moves through the wood to divide its enemies and attack them individually. Zomoks can also call up formidable guardians of mold and vines using magic, and it is rare for them to be without such defending monsters. Some zomoks even consume their shambling minions, holding them in their bodies so creatures the dragon-plants swallow are assaulted inside of them as well as out. Habitat & Society Though zomoks do not inhabit every forests in the First World, they are far from uncommon, and they offer the benefit of protecting nature and its denizens wherever they may go. The finicky zomok's temperament varies with the season. In spring, they are often playful and mercurial, playing pranks on intruders or changing forests paths to confuse travelers. In summer, zomoks find their strength and majesty and become kings of the woodland, attending courts with dryads, satyrs, and stranger folk of the green. In autumn, zomoks become weird mystics, spouting prophecies and cryptic mutterings about the fate of the forests. Only the most foolish would dare approach a zomok in winter, when starvation and the chills of the frost make them vicious and cruel. A zomok wearing its winter coat of rime-covered branches and gray moss can be placated with suitable sacrifices, such as broken axe-heads or nubile virgins with green thumbs. Zomoks have a slightly bemused attitude toward other creatures dwelling in their woods, considering them pets at best and peskies parasites at worst. In event, the mobile nature of a zomok's woodland territory means that there are few longterm residents within the dragon's demesne, although some zomoks have forged extended alliances with dryads, bringing the dryads' trees along each time they move. Like most woodland fey, they despise those who harm trees-woe betide who set axe or fire to wood in the presence of a zomok. Despite this, threatening the forests is often the best way to deal with such a monster. Actually killing a zomok is difficult because of its ability to heal itself through tree striding, so a better tactic is to blast the surrounding woods with fireballs or blights until the plant-dragon agrees to negotiate. Unlike true dragons, zomoks have little interest in treasure, but a few coins or other items may sometimes be found lodged in the branches and roots of the creatures' innards.",76800
Zoog,1,magical beast,forests,"This skittish amalgam of beast parts has luminous eyes, a rat's tail, simian appendages, and tendrils extending from a mole-like nose","Spiteful, nasty creatures with a taste for the flesh of sentient beings, zoogs lurk in the shadowy, moldering places of the world. Often mistaken merely for otherworldly animals, zoogs possess base intentions and vicious demeanors that set them apart from lowly beasts. Congregating in loose, tribal societies, these sinister creatures claim the depths of dark woodlands or moldy forests as their homes, favoring lands where the boundaries between worlds and planes grow thin and strange creatures-not unlike themselves-slip between reality's cracks. Although lone zoogs shy away from attacking larger creatures, when zoogs outnumber an invader they launch deadly ambushes, leaping from sagging boughs and hidden dens to swarm foes. Only strangers with quick tongues and items that appeal to zoogs' interest in magical curiosities might manage to barter for safe passage through zoog territory. While mvictims of zoog attacks are consumed on the spot, some less fortunate few are dragged back to the mystical, strangely carved stones that mark the center of zoog communities. There, such captives become the doomed focus of strange ceremonies before being sacrificed to the zoogs' depraved deities. Commonly, zoogs eat fungi and plants, but they also have a taste for the meat of sentient creatures, treating the butchering and consumption of such beings as a rare privilege. Zoogs also detest cats, and go to great lengths to slay felines of sort and devour them. Occasionally a zoog allows a spellcaster of especial depravity, or with interests in the mysteries of realms and creatures beyond the mortal world, to employ it as a familiar. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have an arcane caster level of 5th or higher to gain a zoog familiar.",400
Zuishin,10,outsider,any,Within this elaborate suit of armor can be seen the partial form of a determined warrior.,"While all kami are enemies of oni, none are so fervent as the zuishin. Known also as shrine kami, zuishin take as their wards gates, doorways, religious places, and the spiritual archways known as torii, ensuring that the gates are respected. Zuishin can use mweapons, but tend to favor the bow. A zuishin treats its equipment with utmost care, viewing weapons as extensions of itself. It never discards its bow voluntarily; if the weapon is ever lost or destroyed, a zuishin can craft a new one in a month. Zuishin treat other kami with respect, and are always willing to lend a helping hand. Creatures other than kami must earn a zuishin's trust before receiving its aid, and do so by honoring the gate it guards or providing an offering to the kami, such as a tree branch or other small piece of nature. Zuishin manifest as suits of armor with a partly manifest warrior within, and wield glowing weapons. They stand 5 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.",9600
Zuvembie,4,undead,land,This withered old corpse has a feral glint in her eyes and clasps a rusty axe in her yellow-nailed hands.,"Tied to the dark forces of nature and unholy magic, zuvembies employ fear and the wild creatures of the land to take their vengeance upon the living. Zuvembies appear to be withered, animate corpses but possess ruthless minds and blasphemous vigor. Revenge fuels a zuvembie, a hatefulness directed toward those who wronged it in life. Yet even when the last one who maligned it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the relatives of the target of its original hate. Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie. Zuvembies stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weigh over 100 pounds.",1200
